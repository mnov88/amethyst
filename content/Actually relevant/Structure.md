## Indispensable:

## For what?
1. Indispensable for **what**?
	1. Main subject matter?
		1. How do we determine it?
			1. What the parties *meant* to achieve? But if so: how do we establish what is *objectively* necessary?
			2. Is this looking into causa? #unsure 
			3. What about ancillary obligations, biforbliktelse? 
				1. NDA? Duty not to make noise when I rent an apartment? Breach of these does not lead to termination claims sometimes. 
				2. See also tilleggskrav, Viggo 217
			4. UTD smartly stays away
	2. Specific obligation
		1. Must be determined under the applicable law
			1. Which can absolutely be foreign law
		2. Why mention the one intended for the DS?
			1. Makes no sense: paying a salary?
			2. Some contracts require no obligation on the DS part at all
		3. Why mention the one for direct contracts alone?
			1. Agents?
			2. Stipulations in favour of third parties, PECL
			3. Performance by third parties?
		4. Why mention separate analysis of separate elements? What about mixed contracts?
	3. Proper performance
		1. What is performance?
		2. What about negative obligations, not to do something? What when you have a contract with both? #unsure 
		3. What is proper? What if there is for instance a delay?

## When?

1. Indispensable, not just useful, **when**?
	1. What about obligations of effort?
	2. What about alternative performance (cannot be declined, see PECL)
	3. What about acting in good faith? Duty to provide information, which can be relevant or not? #unsure 
	4. What about the extra costs, including those for the DS?
