Concerning, in the first place, the interpretation of the concept of ‘matters relating to a contract’ within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation No 44/2001, it is important to note that that concept must be interpreted independently, regard being had to the general scheme and objectives of the regulation, in order to ensure that it is applied uniformly in all the Member States. That concept cannot therefore be taken to refer to classification under the relevant national law of the legal relationship in question before the national court (see by analogy, inter alia, Case C‑26/91 _Handte_ [1992] ECR I‑3967, paragraph 10, and Case C‑265/02 _Frahuil_[2004] ECR I‑1543, paragraph 22).

Another case: As to the second criterion, namely the remuneration paid as consideration for an activity, it must be stated that it is not to be understood strictly as the payment of a sum of money. Such a restriction is neither stipulated by the very general wording of the second indent of Article 5(1)(b) of the Regulation nor consistent with the objectives of proximity and standardisation, set out in paragraphs 30 to 32 of the present judgment, pursued by that provision. It also gives competitive advantage [https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=145906&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1546917](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=145906&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1546917), para 39. Definition: Thus, the concept of ‘matters relating to contract’ within the meaning of that provision is not to be understood as covering a situation in which there is no obligation freely assumed by one party towards another (see, by analogy, Case C‑334/00 _Tacconi_ [2002] ECR I‑7357, paragraphs 22 and 23, and _Engler_, paragraph 50). Another: covers any claim based on an obligation freely consented to by one person towards another
