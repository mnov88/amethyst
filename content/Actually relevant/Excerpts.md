97      As regards, in the first place, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract’.

98      In that regard, in order for the processing of personal data to be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract, within the meaning of that provision, it must be ==**objectively indispensable**== for a purpose that is ==integral== to the contractual obligation ==intended for the data subject==. The controller must therefore be able to demonstrate how ==the main subject matter of the contract **cannot be achieved**== if the processing in question does not occur.

99      The fact that such processing may be ==referred to in the contract or may be **merely useful**== for the performance of the contract is, in itself, i==rrelevant in that regard.== The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be ==**essential** for the **proper performance**== of the contract concluded **between the controller and the data subject** and, therefore, that there are ==no workable, less intrusive alternatives.==

100    In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point 54 of his Opinion, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately.

101    In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of that provision, the referring court mentions, as elements intended to ensure the proper performance of the contract concluded between Meta Platforms Ireland and its users, personalised content and the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services.

102    As regards, first, the justification based on personalised content, it is important to note that, although such a personalisation is useful to the user, in so far as it enables the user, inter alia, to view content corresponding to a large extent to his or her interests, the fact remains that, subject to verification by the referring court, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer that user the services of the online social network. Those services may, where appropriate, be provided to the user in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services.

103    As regards, second, the justification based on the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services, it is apparent from the file before the Court that there is no obligation to subscribe to the various services offered by the Meta group in order to create a user account in the social network Facebook. The various products and services offered by that group can be used independently of each other and the use of each product or service is based on the conclusion of a separate user agreement.

104    Therefore, and subject to verification by the referring court, the processing of personal data from services offered by the Meta group, other than the online social network service, does not appear to be necessary for the latter service to be provided.

 _The third question_
[[AG#^73128e]]
53.      First, according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. ([^73](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote73))

54.      In that regard, I note that the concept of ‘necessity’ is not defined in EU legislation, but according to the case-law, is still an autonomous concept of EU law. ([^74](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote74)) [[CJEU Huber#^86257c]] For the processing to be necessary for the performance of the contract, it is not sufficient for it to be carried out at the time of performance of the contract, to be mentioned in the contract, ([75](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote75)) or even merely to be useful for the performance of the contract. ([76](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote76)) According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the processing must be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract in the sense that there must be no realistic, less intrusive alternatives, ([77](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote77)) taking into account the reasonable expectations of the data subject. ([78](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote78)) It also concerns the fact that, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately. ([79](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote79))

55.      As part of that justification, the referring court mentions the personalised content and continuous, seamless use of the group’s products (or rather services).

56.      As far as the personalised content is concerned, it seems to me that, although that activity may, to some extent, be in the user’s interest, since it makes it possible to display content, particularly in the ‘newsfeed’, which, on the basis of an automated evaluation, matches the user’s interests, it is not apparent that it is also necessary in order to provide the service of the social network at issue, such that the processing of personal data to that end does not require the user’s consent. ([80](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote80)) For the purpose of that examination, consideration should also be given to the fact that the practice at issue concerns the processing not of data relating to the user’s activities on the Facebook site or app, but data originating from external and therefore potentially unlimited sources. Therefore, I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for. ([81](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote81))

57.      With regard to the continuous, seamless use of the group’s services, I note that a link between the various services offered by the applicant in the main proceedings – for example, between Facebook and Instagram – could be useful or even preferable on occasion for the user. However, I doubt that the processing of personal data from other group services (including Instagram) is necessary to provide Facebook services. ([82](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC&pageIndex=1&docid=265901&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=405979#Footnote82))
