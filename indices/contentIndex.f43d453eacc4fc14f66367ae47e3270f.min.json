request for a preliminary ruling was made by the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany) in proceedings between companies in the Meta Platforms group ([2](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote2)) and the Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office, Germany) concerning the decision by which the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicant in the main proceedings from processing data as provided for in the terms of service of its Facebook social network and from implementing those terms of service, and imposed measures to stop it from doing so. ([3](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote3))\n\n2.        The questions referred for a preliminary ruling essentially concern, on the one hand, the competence of a national competition authority such as the Federal Cartel Office to examine, as a principal issue or as an incidental question, the conduct of an undertaking in the light of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ([4](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote4)) and, on the other hand, the interpretation of those provisions with regard to the processing of sensitive personal data, the relevant conditions for the lawfulness of personal data processing and the consent given freely to an undertaking in a dominant position.\n\n **Legal framework**\n\n _**European Union law**_\n\n3.        Article 4 of the GDPR provides:\n\n‘For the purposes of this Regulation:\n\n…\n\n(11)      “consent” of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;\n\n…’\n\n4.        Article 6(1) of the regulation, entitled ‘Lawfulness of processing’, reads as follows:\n\n‘Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\n\n(a)      the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n\n(b)      processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\n(c)      processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\n(d)      processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\n(e)      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\n(f)      processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nPoint (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.’\n\n5.        Article 9(1) and (2) of the regulation, entitled ‘Processing of special categories of personal data’, provides:\n\n‘1.      Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.\n\n2.      Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\n\n(a)      the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;\n\n…\n\n(e)      processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\n\n…’\n\n6.        Article 51 of the regulation, entitled ‘Supervisory authority’, which forms part of Chapter VI, entitled ‘Independent supervisory authorities’, states:\n\n‘1.      Each Member State shall provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union …\n\n2.      Each supervisory authority shall contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union. For that purpose, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and the Commission in accordance with Chapter VII.\n\n…’\n\n _**German law**_\n\n7.        Paragraph 19(1) of the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (Law against restrictions on competition; ‘the GWB’) provides:\n\n‘The abusive exploitation of a dominant position on the market by one or more undertakings is prohibited.’ ([5](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote5))\n\n8.        Paragraph 50f of the GWB provides:\n\n‘(1)      The competition authorities, the regulatory authorities, the federal data protection and freedom of information officer, the regional data protection officers and the competent authorities within the meaning of Article 2 of the EU-Verbraucherschutzdurchführungsgesetz [Law on the implementation of EU consumer protection law] may, irrespective of the procedure chosen, exchange information, including personal data and trade and business secrets, to the extent necessary for the performance of their respective tasks and may use that information in the course of their proceedings. …’\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings, the questions referred for a preliminary ruling and the procedure before the Court**\n\n9.        Meta Platforms operates the online social network ‘Facebook’ in the European Union (www.facebook.com), as well as other online services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The business model of the social networks operated by Meta Platforms essentially consists of offering social network services free of charge for private users and selling online advertising. The advertising is tailored to individual users and aims to show them products and services that might interest them on the basis of, inter alia, their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. The technical basis for this type of advertising is the automated production of detailed profiles of users of Facebook and the online services offered at group level. ([6](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote6))\n\n10.      In order to collect and process user data, Meta Platforms relies on the contract for the use of the services entered into with its users when they click on the ‘Sign up’ button, thereby accepting Facebook’s terms of service. Acceptance of those terms of service is an essential requirement for using the Facebook social network. ([7](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote7)) The central element of this case is the practice of _collecting_ data from other group services, as well as from third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces or via cookies placed on the user’s computer or mobile device, _linking_ those data with the user’s Facebook account and then _using_ them (‘the practice at issue’).\n\n11.      The Federal Cartel Office initiated proceedings against Meta Platforms as a result of which, by the decision at issue, it prohibited Meta Platforms from processing data as provided for in Facebook’s terms of service and from implementing those terms, and imposed measures to stop it from doing so. The Federal Cartel Office based its decision, inter alia, on the fact that under Paragraph 19 of the GWB, the processing in question constituted an abuse of the company’s dominant position in the social media market for private users in Germany. ([8](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote8))\n\n12.      On 11 February 2019, Meta Platforms brought an action against the decision at issue before the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf), ([9](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote9)) which is the referring court. In essence, the referring court has doubts as to the ability of national competition authorities to monitor the compliance of data processing with the requirements laid down in the GDPR and to determine and penalise breaches of the GDPR. It also has doubts as to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of that regulation.\n\n13.      In those circumstances, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘(1)(a)      Is it compatible with Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR if a national competition authority – such as the Federal Cartel Office – which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR, of a Member State in which an undertaking established outside the European Union has an establishment that provides the main establishment of that undertaking – which is located in another Member State and has sole responsibility for processing personal data for the entire territory of the European Union – with advertising, communication and public relations support, finds, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, that the main establishment’s contractual terms relating to data processing and their implementation breach the GDPR and issues an order to end that breach?\n\n(b)      If so: is that compatible with Article 4(3) TEU if, at the same time, the lead supervisory authority in the Member State in which the main establishment, within the meaning of Article 56(1) of the GDPR, is located is investigating the undertaking’s contractual terms relating to data processing?\n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is yes:\n\n(2)(a)      If an internet user merely visits websites or apps to which the criteria of Article 9(1) of the GDPR relate, such as flirting apps, gay dating sites, political party websites or health-related websites, or also enters information into them, for example when registering or when placing orders, and another undertaking, such as Facebook Ireland, uses interfaces integrated into those websites and apps, such as ‘Facebook Business Tools’, or cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, to collect data about those visits to the websites and apps and the information entered by the user, and links those data with the data from the user’s [Facebook] account and uses them, does this collection and/or linking and/or use involve the processing of sensitive [personal] data for the purpose of that provision?\n\n(b)      If so: does visiting those websites or apps and/or entering information and/or clicking or tapping on the buttons integrated into them by a provider such as Facebook Ireland (social plugins such as ‘Like’, ‘Share’ or ‘Facebook Login’ or ‘Account Kit’) constitute manifestly making the data about the visits themselves and/or the information entered by the user public within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR?\n\n(3)      Can an undertaking, such as Facebook Ireland, which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and continuous, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s [Facebook] account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?\n\n(4)      In those circumstances, can\n\n–        the fact of users being underage, vis-à-vis the personalisation of content and advertising, product improvement, network security and non-marketing communications with the user;\n\n–        the provision of measurements, analytics and other business services to enable advertisers, developers and other partners to evaluate and improve their services;\n\n–        the provision of marketing communications to the user to enable the undertaking to improve its products and engage in direct marketing;\n\n–        research and innovation [in the public interest], to further the state of the art or the academic understanding of important social issues and to affect society and the world in a positive way;\n\n–        the sharing of information with law enforcement agencies and responding to legal requests in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, unlawful use, breaches of the terms of service and policies and other harmful behaviour;\n\nalso constitute legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR if, for those purposes, the undertaking links data from other group services and from third-party websites and apps with the user’s [Facebook] account via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device and uses those data?\n\n(5)      In those circumstances, can collecting data from other group services and from third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s [Facebook] account and using them, or using data already collected and linked by other lawful means, also be justified under Article 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the GDPR in individual cases, for example to respond to a legitimate request for certain data (point (c)), to combat harmful behaviour and promote security (point (d)), to [conduct] research [in the public interest] and to promote safety, integrity and security (point (e))?\n\n(6)      Can consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR be given effectively and, in accordance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR in particular, freely, to a dominant undertaking such as Facebook Ireland?\n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is no:\n\n(7)(a)      Can the national competition authority of a Member State, such as the Federal Cartel Office, which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR and which examines a breach by a dominant undertaking of the competition-law prohibition on abuse that is not a breach of the GDPR by that undertaking’s data processing terms and their implementation, determine, when assessing the balance of interests, whether those data processing terms and their implementation comply with the GDPR?\n\n(b)      If so: in the light of Article 4(3) TEU, does that also apply if the competent lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(1) of the GDPR is investigating the undertaking’s data processing terms at the same time?\n\nIf the answer to Question 7 is yes, Questions 3 to 5 must be answered in relation to data from the use of the group’s Instagram service.’\n\n14.      Written observations were received from Meta Platforms, the German, Czech, Italian and Austrian Governments, the Federal Cartel Office, the Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e V. (consumers’ association, Germany) and the European Commission. Those parties also presented oral observations at the hearing held on 10 May 2022.\n\n **Analysis**\n\n15.      The questions referred for a preliminary ruling that are the subject of this case, relating to the interpretation of several provisions of the GDPR, mainly concern: (i) the competence of a competition authority to determine and penalise a breach of the rules on the processing of personal data and its obligations to cooperate with the lead authority within the meaning of the GDPR (first and seventh questions); (ii) the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data and the conditions applicable to consenting to their use (second question); (iii) the lawfulness of the processing of personal data in the light of certain justification (third to fifth questions); (iv) the validity of consent to the processing of personal data given to an undertaking in a dominant position (sixth question).\n\n16.      In the points that follow, I will deal with the first and seventh questions first, before examining the other questions in the order in which they were raised, grouping together the third to fifth questions.\n\n _**The first question**_\n\n17.      By its first question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether a competition authority, when prosecuting a breach of the competition rules, may rule primarily ([10](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote10)) on the infringement of GDPR data processing rules by an undertaking whose main establishment with sole responsibility for processing personal data for the entire territory of the European Union is in another Member State, and, furthermore, issue an order to end that breach (Question 1(a)), and if so, whether the competent lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) of the GDPR may still investigate that undertaking’s contractual terms relating to data processing (Question 1(b)).\n\n18.      Subject to verification by the referring court, it seems to me that the Federal Cartel Office, in the decision at issue, did not penalise a breach of the GDPR by Meta Platforms, but proceeded, for the sole purpose of applying competition rules, to review an alleged abuse of its dominant position while taking account, inter alia, of that undertaking’s non-compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.\n\n19.      Accordingly, in my opinion, Question 1(a), in so far as it concerns a competition authority’s ability to decide, as the main issue, on a breach of the GDPR and to issue an order to end that breach within the meaning of that regulation, is irrelevant. ([11](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote11))\n\n20.      It follows that Question 1(b), which is contingent on an affirmative answer to Question 1(a), is also irrelevant. ([12](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote12))\n\n _**The seventh question**_\n\n21.      By its seventh question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether a competition authority is entitled, when prosecuting infringements of the competition rules, to establish, ([13](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote13)) as an incidental question, whether the data processing terms and their implementation comply with the GDPR (Question 7(a)) and, if so, whether the competition authority’s analysis is also possible where those terms are, at the same time, under investigation by the competent lead supervisory authority (Question 7(b)).\n\n22.      First, with regard to Question 7(a), it seems to me that although a competition authority is not competent to establish a breach of the GDPR, ([14](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote14)) that regulation does not, in principle, preclude authorities other than the supervisory authorities, when exercising their own powers, from being able to take account, as an incidental question, of the compatibility of conduct with the provisions of the GDPR. This is especially true, in my opinion, where a competition authority exercises the powers conferred on it by Article 102 TFEU and by the first paragraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, ([15](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote15)) or by any other equivalent national provision. ([16](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote16))\n\n23.      In exercising its powers, a competition authority must assess, inter alia, whether the conduct in question entails resorting to methods other than those prevailing under merit-based competition, taking into account the legal and economic context in which that conduct takes place. ([17](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote17)) In that respect, the compliance or non-compliance of that conduct with the provisions of the GDPR, not taken in isolation but considering all the circumstances of the case, may be a vital clue as to whether that conduct entails resorting to methods prevailing under merit-based competition, it being stated that the lawful or unlawful nature of conduct under Article 102 TFEU is not apparent from its compliance or lack of compliance with the GDPR or other legal rules. ([18](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote18))\n\n24.      Therefore, I consider that the examination of an abuse of a dominant position on the market may justify the interpretation, by a competition authority, of rules other than those relating to competition law, such as those of the GDPR, ([19](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote19)) while specifying that such an examination is carried out in an incidental manner ([20](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote20)) and is without prejudice to the application of that regulation by the competent supervisory authorities. ([21](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote21))\n\n25.      Second, with regard to Question 7(b), the referring court is asking what obligations, in the context of the application of the principle of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) TEU, a competition authority has, when interpreting the provisions of the GDPR, in respect of the competent lead supervisory authority within the meaning of that regulation, particularly when the conduct under investigation by the competition authority is also being investigated by the competent lead supervisory authority.\n\n26.      In the present case, the investigation, albeit incidental, by a competition authority of an undertaking’s conduct in the light of the GDPR carries the risk of differing interpretations of that regulation by the competition authority and the supervisory authorities, which could in principle undermine the uniform interpretation of the GDPR. ([22](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote22))\n\n27.      EU law does not provide detailed rules on cooperation between a competition authority and supervisory authorities within the meaning of the GDPR in such a situation. More specifically, neither the mechanism for cooperation among competent authorities within the meaning of the GDPR when applying that regulation, ([23](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote23)) nor other specific rules on cooperation among administrative authorities, such as those on cooperation among competition authorities, and between competition authorities and the Commission when applying competition rules, ([24](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote24)) are applicable in the present case.\n\n28.      Nevertheless, a competition authority, when interpreting the GDPR, is bound by the duty to cooperate in good faith enshrined in Article 4(3) TEU, according to which the European Union and the Member States, including their administrative authorities, ([25](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote25)) must, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties. In particular, the third paragraph of that article provides that the Member States must facilitate the achievement of the European Union’s tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the European Union’s objectives. ([26](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote26)) In addition, like any administrative authority responsible for enforcing EU law, a competition authority is bound by the principle of sound administration as a general principle of EU law, which includes, inter alia, an extensive duty of diligence and care on the part of national authorities. ([27](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote27))\n\n29.      Thus, in the absence of clear rules on cooperation mechanisms, which it may fall to the EU legislature to adopt, a competition authority, when interpreting the provisions of the GDPR, is subject, at the very least, to a duty to inform and cooperate with the competent authorities within the meaning of that regulation, in accordance with the national provisions that govern its powers (principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States) and in compliance with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. ([28](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote28))\n\n30.      It follows, in my view, that where the competent lead supervisory authority has ruled on the application of certain provisions of the GDPR in respect of the same practice or similar practices, the competition authority cannot, in principle, deviate from the interpretation of that authority, which is the sole competent authority for the application of that regulation, ([29](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote29)) and must, as far as possible and with due regard, in particular, for the rights of the defence of the data subjects, comply with any decisions adopted by that authority concerning the same conduct, ([30](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote30)) and, in the event of doubts in the case at hand as to the interpretation given by the competent authority, consult it or, where that authority is in another Member State, the national supervisory authority. ([31](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote31))\n\n31.      Even without a decision by the competent supervisory authority, it is still the competition authority’s duty to inform ([32](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote32)) and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority where that authority has begun an investigation of the same practice or has indicated its intention to do so, and possibly to await the outcome of that authority’s investigation before commencing its own assessment, in so far as that is appropriate and is without prejudice to the competition authority abiding by a reasonable investigation period and the rights of defence of the data subjects. ([33](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote33))\n\n32.      In the present case, it seems to me that the fact that the Federal Cartel Office entered into cooperation with the supervisory authorities responsible at national level ([34](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote34)) and that the lead supervisory authority in Ireland has also been contacted informally – circumstances alluded to by the Federal Cartel Office and which it is for the referring court to verify – may be sufficient evidence that the authority has fulfilled its duties of diligence and sincere cooperation. ([35](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote35))\n\n33.      In conclusion, I propose that the answer to the seventh question referred for a preliminary ruling should be that Articles 51 to 66 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a competition authority, within the framework of its powers under the competition rules, may examine, as an incidental question, the compliance of the practices under investigation with the GDPR rules, while taking account of any decision or investigation of the competent supervisory authority on the basis of the GDPR, informing and, where appropriate, consulting the national supervisory authority.\n\n _**The second question**_\n\n34.      By its second question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether Article 9(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the practice at issue, when it concerns visits to third-party websites and apps, ([36](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote36)) involves processing the types of sensitive personal data mentioned, ([37](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote37)) which is prohibited ([38](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote38)) (Question 2(a)), and if so, whether Article 9(2)(e) of that regulation must be interpreted as meaning that a user manifestly makes public within the meaning of that provision the data revealed by visiting those websites and apps, or entered into those websites or apps, or resulting from clicking on buttons integrated into those websites or apps ([39](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote39)) (Question 2(b)).\n\n35.      First, with regard to Question 2(a), I would point out that the processing of sensitive personal data is prohibited under Article 9(1) of the GDPR. The specific protection of such data is justified – as is apparent from recital 51 of that regulation – by the fact that they are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms and their processing could create significant risks to those fundamental rights and freedoms. Furthermore, despite the somewhat obscure wording of that provision, ([40](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote40)) it does not seem to me that, as the referring court assumes, it introduces a substantial difference between personal data that are sensitive because they ‘reveal’ a certain situation and data that are inherently sensitive. ([41](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote41))\n\n36.      In the present case, it is clear, in my view, that the practice at issue entails the processing of personal data which is, in principle, liable to fall within the scope of that provision and to be prohibited where the data processed ‘reveal’ one of the sensitive situations referred to therein. It is necessary therefore to establish whether and to what extent visiting websites and apps or entering data into them may be ‘indicative’ of one of the sensitive situations listed in the provision in question.\n\n37.      In that respect, I doubt whether it is relevant (or always possible) to distinguish between the data subject merely being interested in certain information and the data subject belonging to one of the categories covered by the provision in question. ([42](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote42)) Although the parties to the main proceedings have opposing views in that regard, ([43](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote43)) I believe the answer to that question must be sought on a case-by-case basis and with regard to each of the activities comprising the practice at issue.\n\n38.      Although, as the German Government points out, simply collecting sensitive personal data about the visit to a website or an app is not, in itself, necessarily the same as processing sensitive personal data within the meaning of that provision, ([44](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote44)) linking the data to the relevant user’s Facebook account or using the data could, on the other hand, both easily amount to such processing. The decisive factor for the purpose of applying Article 9(1) of the GDPR is, in my view, whether the data processed allow user profiling based on the categories that emerge from the types of sensitive personal data mentioned in that article. ([45](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote45))\n\n39.      In that context, to be able to determine whether data processing falls within the scope of that provision, it might be worth distinguishing, where appropriate, between the processing of data which prima facie may be categorised as sensitive personal data, which alone allow profiling of the data subject, and the processing of data that are not inherently sensitive but require subsequent aggregation in order to draw plausible conclusions for profiling purposes.\n\n40.      However, it should be clarified that the existence of categorisation within the meaning of that provision is independent of whether that categorisation is accurate or correct. ([46](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote46)) What counts is the possibility that such categorisation could create a significant risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, as stated in recital 51 of the GDPR, regardless of whether or not that possibility materialises.\n\n41.      Lastly, as to the referring court’s question whether the purpose for which the data are used is relevant to the assessment in question, ([47](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote47)) I find – contrary to the argument put forward by the applicant in the main proceedings – that in principle, the controller is not required to process those data knowing and intending to derive particular categories of information directly from them. The aim of the provision in question is, in essence, objectively to prevent significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects arising from the processing of sensitive personal data, irrespective of any subjective element such as the controller’s intention.\n\n42.      Second, as regards Question 2(b), it should be recalled that, pursuant to Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data does not apply if the processing relates to personal data which are _manifestly made public_ by the data subject. Moreover, the inclusion in the wording of that provision of the adverb ‘manifestly’ and the fact that the provision constitutes an exemption to the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data ([48](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote48)) require a particularly stringent application of that exemption, on account of the significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. ([49](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote49)) In order for that exemption to apply, the user must, in my opinion, be _fully aware_ that, by an _explicit act_, ([50](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote50)) he or she is making personal data public. ([51](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote51))\n\n43.      In the present case, it seems to me that conduct consisting in visiting websites and apps, entering data into those websites and apps and clicking on buttons integrated into them cannot, in principle, be regarded in the same way as conduct that manifestly makes public the user’s sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR.\n\n44.      In principle, the browsing data from _visits to websites and apps_ is only visible to the administrator of the website or app in question and to the third parties to whom the administrator transmits such information, such as the applicant in the main proceedings. ([52](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote52)) Similarly, although by _entering data into websites and apps_, the data subject could disclose, directly and voluntarily, information about certain sensitive personal data, that information is only visible to the administrator of the website or app in question and to third parties to whom the administrator transmits that information. I would say therefore that those actions cannot constitute evidence of the user’s wish to make the data publicly available. ([53](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote53)) Furthermore, while it is clear that, by _clicking on buttons integrated into websites or apps_, ([54](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote54)) the data subject is clearly expressing a wish to share certain information with the public outside the website or app in question, I am of the opinion that, as the Federal Cartel Office points out, by doing so, the person in question is conscious that he or she is sharing information with a _specific group of people_, often defined by the user himself or herself, ([55](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote55)) and not with the general public. ([56](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote56))\n\n45.      Lastly, with regard to the relevance of any consent given by the user within the meaning of Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58 so that personal data may be collected by cookies or similar technologies, as described by the referring court, I do not consider such consent, in view of its specific purpose, to be sufficient to justify the processing of sensitive personal data collected by such methods. ([57](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote57)) Indeed, such consent, which is necessary to install the technical means to capture certain user activities, ([58](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote58)) does not involve the processing of sensitive personal data and cannot be regarded as a wish to make such data manifestly public within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR. ([59](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote59))\n\n46.      In conclusion, I propose that the answer to the second question referred for a preliminary ruling should be that Article 9(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data may include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network consisting in the collection of a user’s data when he or she visits other websites or apps or enters such data into them, the linking of such data to the user account on the social network and the use of such data, provided that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, make it possible to profile users on the basis of the categories that emerge from the listing in that provision of types of sensitive personal data. In addition, Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a user does not manifestly make public data revealed by visiting websites and apps or entered into those websites or apps or resulting from clicking on buttons integrated into those websites or apps.\n\n _**The third to fifth questions**_\n\n47.      By its third to fifth questions referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether Article 6(1)(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the practice at issue ([60](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote60)) falls within the scope of one of the grounds provided for in those provisions, and in particular:\n\n–        the necessity for the performance of the contract ([61](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote61)) or the taking account of legitimate interests, ([62](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote62)) given that Meta Platforms operates a social network funded by advertising and offering, in its terms of service, personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and continuous, seamless use of all group products (third question referred for a preliminary ruling);\n\n–        the taking account of those legitimate interests ([63](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote63)) in the context of certain situations ([64](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote64)) (fourth question referred for a preliminary ruling);\n\n–        the need to respond to a legitimate request for certain data, ([65](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote65)) to combat harmful behaviour and promote security, ([66](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote66)) or to conduct research in the public interest and to promote safety, integrity and security ([67](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote67)) (fifth question referred for a preliminary ruling).\n\n48.      As a preliminary point, notwithstanding several questions as to the admissibility of the fourth and fifth questions, ([68](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote68)) I propose to answer the third to fifth questions together, in so far as the information I will provide below, mainly with regard to the third question, may also be useful to the referring court when applying the provisions that are the subject of the fourth and fifth questions.\n\n49.      Principally, I note that, in accordance with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’), personal data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of a legitimate basis laid down by law. In that respect, Article 6(1) of the GDPR specifies that the processing of such data is lawful only if one of the six conditions set out in that article is met. ([69](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote69))\n\n50.      In the present case, I believe that the third to fifth questions call for a detailed case-by-case analysis of the various clauses of the Facebook terms of service in the context of the practice at issue, since it is impossible to establish whether, in respect of that practice, ‘an undertaking, such as [Meta Platforms]’ can comprehensively rely on all (or some) of the grounds set out in Article 6(1) of the GDPR, even though it is possible that said practice, or some of its component activities, may, in certain cases, fall within the scope of that article. ([70](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote70))\n\n51.      Furthermore, the processing envisaged by the provisions cited is carried out, in the present case, on the basis of the general conditions of contract imposed by the controller, in the absence of the consent of the data subject, ([71](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote71)) or even against his or her will, which, in my opinion, calls for a strict interpretation of the grounds in question, particularly in order to avoid any circumvention of the requirement for consent. ([72](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote72))\n\n52.      Lastly, I would point out that, under Article 5(2) of the GDPR, the controller is responsible for demonstrating that the personal data are processed in accordance with the regulation. Moreover, under Article 13(1)(c) of that regulation, it is for the controller to specify the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended, as well as the legal basis for the processing.\n\n _The third question_\n\n53.      First, according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. ([73](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote73)) ^73128e\n\n54.      In that regard, I note that the concept of ‘necessity’ is not defined in EU legislation, but according to the case-law, is still an autonomous concept of EU law. ([74](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote74)) [[CJEU Huber#^86257c]] For the processing to be necessary for the performance of the contract, it is not sufficient for it to be carried out at the time of performance of the contract, to be mentioned in the contract, ([75](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote75)) or even merely to be useful for the performance of the contract. ([76](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote76)) According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the processing must be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract in the sense that there must be no realistic, less intrusive alternatives, ([77](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote77)) taking into account the reasonable expectations of the data subject. ([78](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote78)) It also concerns the fact that, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately. ([79](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote79))\n\n55.      As part of that justification, the referring court mentions the personalised content and continuous, seamless use of the group’s products (or rather services).\n\n56.      As far as the personalised content is concerned, it seems to me that, although that activity may, to some extent, be in the user’s interest, since it makes it possible to display content, particularly in the ‘newsfeed’, which, on the basis of an automated evaluation, matches the user’s interests, it is not apparent that it is also necessary in order to provide the service of the social network at issue, such that the processing of personal data to that end does not require the user’s consent. ([80](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote80)) **For the purpose of that examination, consideration should also be given to the fact that the practice at issue concerns the processing not of data relating to the user’s activities on the Facebook site or app, but data originating from external and therefore potentially unlimited sources.** Therefore, I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for. ([81](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote81))\n\n57.      With regard to the continuous, seamless use of the group’s services, I note that a link between the various services offered by the applicant in the main proceedings – for example, between Facebook and Instagram – could be useful or even preferable on occasion for the user. However, I doubt that the processing of personal data from other group services (including Instagram) is necessary to provide Facebook services. ([82](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote82))\n\n58.      Second, according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful only if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\n59.      According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the provision in question lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence. ([83](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote83))\n\n60.      First, with regard to the pursuit of a legitimate interest, the GDPR and the case-law recognise a wide range of interests considered legitimate, ([84](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote84)) while specifying that, according to Article 13(1)(d) of the GDPR, it is the responsibility of the controller to indicate the legitimate interests pursued under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. ([85](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote85))\n\n61.      As to the condition relating to the necessity of processing personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. ([86](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote86)) It is necessary therefore for a close link to exist between the processing and the interest pursued, in the absence of alternatives that are more data-protection friendly, since it is not enough for the processing merely to be of use to the controller.\n\n62.      Lastly, as regards the balancing of the interests of the controller and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, it is for the referring court to weigh the interests at stake. ([87](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote87)) To that end, as stated in recital 47 of the GDPR, it is essential to take into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller and to determine whether the data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.\n\n63.      As part of that justification, the referring court mentions the personalisation of advertising, network security and product improvement.\n\n64.      First, with regard to the personalisation of advertising, it is clear from recital 47 of the GDPR that the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest of the controller. However, when it comes to the necessity of the processing, it is worth noting that the data in question originate from sources outside Facebook. The question therefore arises as to the ‘degree of personalisation’ of the advertising objectively necessary in that respect. As for balancing the interests at stake, consideration should be given to the nature of the legitimate interest in question (in this case, a purely economic interest), as well as the impact of the processing on the user, including his or her reasonable expectations, and to any safeguards put in place by the controller. ([88](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote88))\n\n65.      Similar points can be made in relation to network security. While such a justification may constitute a legitimate interest of the controller, ([89](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote89)) it is less obvious to conclude that the processing is necessary in the present case, given that the data in question originate from sources outside Facebook. ([90](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote90)) At any rate, it is the responsibility of the controller to specify the security purposes on which any processing is based.\n\n66.      Lastly, with regard to product improvement, although security-related improvements – which fall under the specific justification examined above – are excluded, it seems to me that such a justification should be in the interest of the user rather than the data controller. From that perspective, it is unclear to what extent it could constitute a legitimate interest of the controller, thus avoiding the need for the user’s consent. With regard to the condition of necessity and the balancing of the rights and interests at stake, I refer to the points made previously.\n\n _The fourth and fifth questions_\n\n67.      By its fourth question referred for a preliminary ruling, which is essentially an extension of the second part of the third question referred, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the recurrence of some of the situations mentioned implies the existence of a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Conversely, by its fifth question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the need to respond to a legitimate request to provide certain data, the need to combat harmful behaviour and promote security or to conduct research in the public interest and to promote safety, integrity and security justify the practice at issue. ([91](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote91))\n\n68.      Regardless of whether those questions are admissible, ([92](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote92)) in general, it cannot be excluded, in relation to the fourth question, that certain clauses characterising the practice at issue may be justified  by legitimate interests in the circumstances described by the referring court, ([93](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote93)) and in relation to the fifth question, that in certain situations, the practice at issue may be justified on the basis of the provisions cited.\n\n69.      Nevertheless, it is unclear from the order for reference whether, and to what extent, Meta Platforms Ireland has explained – for each purpose of processing and type of data processed – the actual legitimate interests pursued or other justification that may be relevant in the present case. ([94](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote94)) It is for the referring court, in the light of the foregoing, to examine to what extent, in the circumstances described by that court, the practice at issue is justified by the existence of legitimate interests of Meta Platforms Ireland in the processing of data within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR or by any other condition laid down in Article 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) of that regulation.\n\n _The answer to the third to fifth questions_\n\n70.      In conclusion, I propose that the answer to the third to fifth questions referred for a preliminary ruling should be that Article 6(1)(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the practice at issue, or some of the activities that comprise it, may be covered by the exemptions laid down in those provisions, as long as each data processing method examined fulfils the conditions provided for by the justification specifically put forward by the controller, and that therefore:\n\n–        the processing is objectively necessary for the provision of the services relating to the Facebook account;\n\n–        the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed and does not have a disproportionate effect on the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject;\n\n–        the processing is necessary to respond to a legitimate request for certain data, to combat harmful behaviour and promote security, to conduct research in the public interest and to promote safety, integrity and security.\n\n _**The sixth question**_\n\n71.      By its sixth question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR are to be interpreted as meaning that consent within the meaning of Article 4(11) of that regulation may be given effectively and freely to an undertaking having a dominant position in the national market for online social networks for private users.\n\n72.      I would first like to point out that Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR respectively require the consent of the data subject to the processing of personal data in general and to the processing of sensitive personal data. Furthermore, according to Article 4(11) of the GDPR, for the purposes of the regulation, ‘consent’ of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which that person, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. ([95](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote95))\n\n73.      With regard, in particular, to the requirement for ‘freedom’ of consent, which is the only requirement challenged in this case, I note that, according to recital 42 of the GDPR, consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice ([96](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote96)) or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. ([97](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote97)) Furthermore, as provided for in Article 7(1) of the GDPR (and reiterated in recital 42 thereof), where processing is based on consent of the data subject, the controller must be able to demonstrate that that person consented to the processing of his or her personal data.\n\n74.      As to relevance in the present case, as stated in the first sentence of recital 43 of the GDPR, consent should not serve as a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data where there is a ‘clear imbalance’ between the data subject and the controller. ([98](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote98)) Furthermore, under Article 7(4) of the GDPR, when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. ([99](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote99)) Lastly, according to the second sentence of recital 43 of the GDPR, consent is also presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case. ([100](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote100))\n\n75.      In the present case, I am of the opinion that any dominant position on the market held by a personal data controller operating a social network is a factor when assessing whether users of that network have given their consent freely. Indeed, the market power of the controller could lead to a clear imbalance in the sense described in point 74 of this Opinion. ([101](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote101)) However, it should be clarified that for such a market power to be relevant from the point of view of enforcing the GDPR, it need not necessarily be regarded as a dominant position within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU. ([102](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote102)) Besides, that circumstance alone cannot, in principle, render the consent invalid. ([103](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote103))\n\n76.      Therefore, the validity of consent should be examined on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the other factors mentioned in points 73 and 74 of this Opinion, taking into account all the circumstances of the case and the controller’s responsibility to demonstrate that the data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n\n77.      In conclusion, I propose that the answer to the sixth question referred for a preliminary ruling should be that Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the mere fact that an undertaking that operates a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social networks for private users cannot, on its own, render invalid the consent of the user of that network to the processing of his or her personal data under Article 4(11) of that regulation. However, that fact does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it.\n\n **Conclusion**\n\n78.      In the light of the foregoing, I propose that the Court of Justice reply to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany) as follows:\n\n(1)      Articles 51 to 66 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a competition authority, within the framework of its powers under the competition rules, may examine, as an incidental question, the compliance of the practices investigated with the rules of that regulation, while taking into account any decision or investigation of the competent supervisory authority on the basis of said regulation, informing and, where appropriate, consulting that authority.\n\n(2)      Article 9(1) of Regulation 2016/679\n\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data may include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network consisting in the collection of the user’s data when that user visits other websites or apps or enters such data into those websites or apps, linking the data to the user account on the social network and then using the data, provided that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, allows user profiling based on the categories that emerge from the types of sensitive personal data mentioned in that article.\n\nArticle 9(2)(e) of that regulation\n\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a user does not manifestly make public the data revealed by visiting websites and apps or entered into those websites or apps or resulting from having clicked on buttons integrated into those websites or apps.\n\n(3)      Article 6(1)(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Regulation 2016/679\n\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the practice consisting in (i) the _collection_ of data from other group services, as well as from third-party websites and apps, by interfaces integrated into the latter or by cookies placed on the user’s computer or mobile terminal, (ii) the _linking_ of such data with the user’s Facebook account and (iii) the _use_ of said data or some of the activities comprising that practice may be covered by the exemptions laid down in those provisions, as long as each data processing method examined fulfils the conditions provided for by the justification specifically put forward by the controller, and that therefore:\n\n–        the processing is objectively necessary for the provision of the services relating to the Facebook account;\n\n–        the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed and does not have a disproportionate effect on the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject;\n\n–        the processing is necessary to respond to a legitimate request for certain data, to combat harmful behaviour and promote security, to conduct research in the public interest and to promote safety, integrity and security.\n\n(4)      Articles 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) of Regulation 2016/679\n\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the mere fact that an undertaking providing a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social networks for private users cannot, on its own, render invalid the consent of the user of that network to the processing of his or her personal data under Article 4(11) of that regulation. However, that fact does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it.\n\n---\n\n[1](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref1)      Original language: French.\n\n---\n\n[2](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref2)      Namely Meta Platforms Inc.

Furthermore, since 28 January 2020, Meta Platforms has been offering, at a global level, ‘Off-Facebook-Activity’, which allows Facebook users to view a summary of the information about them, obtained in relation to their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect the data about past and future activities from their Facebook account if they so wish.\n\n---\n\n[10](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref10)      It seems to me that the expression ‘finds … that the main establishment’s contractual terms relating to data processing and their implementation breach the GDPR and issues an order to end that breach’ in the first question referred for a preliminary ruling must be interpreted in that sense.\n\n---\n\n[11](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref11)      At any rate, given that the GDPR provides for the full harmonisation of data protection laws, the central element of which is a harmonised enforcement mechanism based on the ‘one-stop shop’ principle set out in Articles 51 to 67 of that regulation, it seems obvious to me that an authority other than a supervisory authority within the meaning of that regulation (such as a competition authority) does not have the competence to make a ruling, primarily, on a breach of that regulation or to impose the penalties envisaged.\n\n---\n\n[12](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref12)      In any event, given that a competition authority is not competent to establish, primarily, a breach of that regulation or to impose the penalties envisaged, any such decision by a competition authority would not impinge on the powers of the supervisory authorities within the meaning of the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[13](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref13)      It seems to me that that is how the terms ‘determine, when assessing the balance of interests, whether those data processing terms and their implementation comply with the GDPR’ in the seventh question should be interpreted.\n\n---\n\n[14](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref14)      See footnote 11 to this Opinion.\n\n---\n\n[15](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref15)      Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in [Articles 101 and 102 TFEU] (OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1).\n\n---\n\n[16](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref16)      Such as Paragraph 19 of the GWB, on which the decision at issue is based.\n\n---\n\n[17](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref17)      See, by way of example, judgment of 6 September 2017, _Intel_ v _Commission_ (C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 136 and the case-law cited). Moreover, the Court has clarified that the scope of Article 102 TFEU is of general application and cannot be restricted by the existence of a regulatory framework adopted by the EU legislature – in this case, the regulatory framework for electronic communications (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, _Telefónica and Telefónica de España_ v _Commission_, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 128).\n\n---\n\n[18](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref18)      In the light of the different objectives of the two categories of provisions, it is clear that conduct relating to data processing may breach competition rules even if it complies with the GDPR; conversely, unlawful conduct under the GDPR does not automatically mean that it breaches competition rules. In that regard, the Court of Justice has clarified that the compliance of conduct with specific legislation does not preclude the applicability, to that conduct, of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (see, in particular, judgment of 6 December 2012, _AstraZeneca_ v _Commission_ (C‑457/10 P, EU:C:2012:770, paragraph 132), in which the Court of Justice also recalled that in the majority of cases, abuses of dominant positions consist of behaviour which is otherwise lawful under branches of law other than competition law). Indeed, if only practices which objectively restrict competition and are at the same time unlawful were regarded as abusive within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, that would mean that conduct which is potentially harmful to competition could not, merely because it is lawful, be penalised under Article 102 TFEU, which would compromise the objective of that provision, namely to establish a system which ensures that competition in the internal market is not distorted (see, to that effect, my Opinion in _Servizio Elettrico Nazionale and Others_, C‑377/20, EU:C:2021:998, point 37). According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, it is only if anticompetitive conduct is required of undertakings by national legislation, or if the latter creates a legal framework which itself eliminates any possibility of competitive activity on their part, that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU do not apply, whereas those articles may apply if it is found that the national legislation leaves open the possibility of competition which may be prevented, restricted or distorted by the autonomous conduct of undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 October 2010, _Deutsche Telekom_ v _Commission_, C‑280/08 P, EU:C:2010:603, paragraph 80 and the case-law cited).\n\n---\n\n[19](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref19)      An interpretation whereby competition authorities would be prohibited from interpreting the provisions of the GDPR when exercising their powers could call into question the effective application of EU competition law.\n\n---\n\n[20](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref20)      Moreover, the incidental nature of the competition authority’s interpretation of the GDPR does not prevent that interpretation from being subject to judicial review before the national courts competent in competition matters. In the event of difficulties in interpretation, those courts could be required to submit a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice, as in the present case with regard to the second to sixth questions referred.\n\n---\n\n[21](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref21)      The competition authority’s _interpretation_ of the GDPR solely for the purpose of applying the rules (and possibly imposing penalties) provided for by competition law cannot deprive the supervisory authorities of their competences and powers under that regulation. Furthermore, the possibility of an incidental interpretation of that regulation by the competition authority raises no additional difficulties with regard to its _application_, which is reserved for the supervisory authorities, or the _imposition of corrective measures or penalties_, since any measures or penalties that may be imposed by a competition authority are based on different rules, objectives and legitimate interests than those protected by that regulation (for that reason, in such a situation, the penalties imposed by the competition authority and supervisory authority under the GDPR are not, in my view, covered by the principle _ne bis in idem_ (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 March 2022, _bpost_, C‑117/20, EU:C:2022:202, paragraphs 42 to 50)).\n\n---\n\n[22](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref22)      In addition, the risk of differing interpretation is inherent in any area governed by rules that the competition authority must or may take into account in order to assess the legality of conduct under competition law.\n\n---\n\n[23](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref23)      Chapters VI and VII of the GDPR establish ‘one-stop-shop’ mechanisms for the exchange of information and for mutual assistance between supervisory authorities.\n\n---\n\n[24](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref24)      See Regulation No 1/2003 and Directive (EU) 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market (OJ 2019 L 11, p. 3).\n\n---\n\n[25](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref25)      See in particular, to that effect, judgments of 14 November 1989, _Italy_ v _Commission_ (14/88, EU:C:1989:421, paragraph 20) and of 11 June 1991, _Athanasopoulos and Others_ (C‑251/89, EU:C:1991:242, paragraph 57).\n\n---\n\n[26](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref26)      Moreover, the cooperation mechanism established by the GDPR for supervisory authorities may itself be regarded as a _lex specialis_ supplementing and clarifying the general principle of sincere cooperation set out in Article 4(3) TEU (see, in particular, Hijmans, H., ‘Article 51 Supervisory authority’, _The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary_, Oxford, 2020, p. 869). The same applies to other cooperation instruments that pre-date the one provided for in the GDPR, such as the system of cooperation among competition authorities (see in particular Chapter IV of Regulation No 1/2003).\n\n---\n\n[27](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref27)      See, to that effect, the Opinion of Advocate General Trstenjak in _Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso_ v _Parliament_ (C‑308/07 P, EU:C:2008:498, point 89).\n\n---\n\n[28](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref28)      See, in particular, judgment of 2 June 2022, _Skeyes_ (C‑353/20, EU:C:2022:423, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited). In my opinion, guidance on the correct approach may, where appropriate, be derived from the cooperation system established by the GDPR, and from that established in the field of competition. However, in the absence of ad hoc provisions, the competition authority’s duty of care does not extend as far as to subject it to detailed obligations such as those laid down in the cooperation procedure and consistency mechanism governed by Chapter VII of the GDPR (for example, the competition authority cannot be expected to send a draft decision to the competent supervisory authority within the meaning of that regulation in order to obtain its opinion).\n\n---\n\n[29](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref29)      See, in particular and by analogy, in relation to an area covered by EU rules on pharmaceutical matters, judgment of 23 January 2018, _F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Others_(C‑179/16, EU:C:2018:25, paragraphs 58 to 64).\n\n---\n\n[30](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref30)      In other words, that decision forms part of the legal and factual framework which the competition authority is required to examine, while remaining free to draw its own conclusions from the point of view of the application of competition law (see footnote 18 to this Opinion).\n\n---\n\n[31](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref31)      Given the role and functions of national supervisory authorities in the system of cooperation established by the GDPR, I consider that interaction with the national supervisory authority alone may be sufficient to fulfil the competition authority’s duties of diligence and sincere cooperation, particularly where the competition authority lacks the ability (given the applicable national law procedures) or the resources (linguistic or otherwise) to interact satisfactorily with the lead supervisory authority of another Member State.\n\n---\n\n[32](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref32)      Or where that authority is in another Member State the national supervisory authority (see footnote 31 to this Opinion).\n\n---\n\n[33](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref33)      Bearing in mind that a competition authority’s interpretation of certain provisions of the GDPR when exercising its powers is without prejudice to the interpretation and application of those provisions by the competent supervisory authorities within the meaning of that regulation (see footnote 21 to this Opinion).\n\n---\n\n[34](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref34)      The Federal Cartel Office submits in that respect that it relied on German competition law, which allows it to interact with national supervisory authorities within the meaning of the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[35](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref35)      This is particularly the case if, as the Federal Cartel Office contends, the German federal supervisory authority and the Irish lead supervisory authority have confirmed to it that the latter has not initiated any proceedings in respect of the same practices investigated by the Federal Cartel Office.\n\n---\n\n[36](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref36)      The referring court mentions visits by a user to websites or apps and enters data into those websites or apps (such as flirting apps, gay dating sites, political party websites or health-related websites), which reveal data protected by the provision in question.\n\n---\n\n[37](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref37)      Referred to hereinafter as ‘sensitive personal data’.

Unless I am mistaken, the French version of that provision contradicts most of the other language versions. Moreover, in the context of that provision, it seems to me more logical to link the verb ‘reveal’ to the data, since in the rest of the provision it is the data that are the subject of the analysis and not the processing. This is also apparent from the French wording of recital 51 of the GDPR, which states that sensitive personal data ‘should include _personal data_ [_that reveal_] racial or ethnic origin’ (emphasis added).\n\n---\n\n[41](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref41)      In my view, it is inconsistent with the spirit of Article 9(1) of the GDPR (and of the regulation as a whole) – namely to protect certain sensitive personal data – to distinguish, for example, between, on the one hand, racial or ethnic origin, which would include the prohibition on processing not only data that indicate that directly, but also data that reveal that situation, and on the other hand, genetic data, where the prohibition on processing would not extend to data revealing that situation, while adding that it would not always be easy to distinguish between data _revealing_ certain situations (for example, racial or ethnic origin) and data _concerning_ other situations (for example, health). In that respect, I note that while Article 9(1) of the GDPR refers to data _concerning_ health, Article 4(15) of the GDPR defines ‘data concerning health’ as ‘personal data _related_ to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, _which reveal_ information about his or her health status’ (emphasis added). As the German Government suggests, it is possible that that inconsistency in the wording of the provision in question is merely a vain attempt to distinguish between pure data with a direct informational content and ‘metadata’ for which the corresponding informational content is only apparent in specific circumstances, for example when analysed or linked.\n\n---\n\n[42](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref42)      In principle, as the applicant in the main proceedings contends, those are two different aspects. Indeed, the mere fact that a user has accessed or interacted with a website does not necessarily reveal information about his or her beliefs, health, political opinions and so forth, because having an interest in a website does not automatically entail endorsing the views expressed on that website or belonging to the categories it represents. That is especially the case with visits to the website of a political party or a website that espouses a particular political ideology: it does not necessarily mean that the user shares that ideology; he or she might simply be curious or even critical of that ideology.\n\n---\n\n[43](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref43)      According to Meta Platforms, the fact that a user has accessed or interacted with a website does not in itself reveal sensitive information, because even if an interest in a website were observed or used, it would not constitute processing of sensitive personal data. That would only be the case if users were _categorised_ on the basis of those data. Consequently, the data concerned by the practice at issue would only be protected under Article 9(1) of the GDPR if they were in one of the categories covered by that article and were processed subjectively, in full knowledge of the facts and with the intention of deriving such information from them. Conversely, according to the interpretation of the Federal Cartel Office – which is too rigid in my view – the mere fact that the data subject visits a particular website or uses a specific app whose main focus is one of the categories listed in Article 9(1) of the GDPR already triggers the protection afforded by that provision. The protection of sensitive personal data does not depend on the controller’s _intention_ to use such data, because the rights of the data subject are already affected by the fact that those data are removed from his or her sphere of influence.\n\n---\n\n[44](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref44)      As the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) acknowledges, the mere fact that a social media provider processes large amounts of data which potentially could be used to infer special categories of data does not automatically mean that the processing falls under Article 9 of the GDPR (see EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 of 13 April 2021 on the targeting of social media users (‘the EDPB Guidelines 8/2020’),

an interpretation would, in my view, prevent a situation – criticised by the applicant in the main proceedings – in which the controller is essentially in breach of the GDPR by default since it could

The Federal Cartel Office points out that it is for the controller to establish in detail which data will actually be processed in each use scenario. It further contends that the applicant in the main proceedings merely stated that _all processing_ of data from sources other than Facebook would be necessary for _each of the purposes_ of processing mentioned in the terms of service. By contrast, Meta Platforms Ireland takes the view that, without examining the specific aspects of each processing operation, the Federal Cartel Office cannot rule out the fact that the practice at issue might be based on the grounds in question and so cannot conclude that the practice is incompatible with the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[71](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref71)      The user’s consent is provided for in Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[72](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref72)      Paragraph 16 of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 states, inter alia, that both purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR) and data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR) principles are particularly relevant in contracts for online services, which typically are not negotiated on an individual basis, in view of the acute risk that data controllers may seek to include general processing terms in contracts in order to maximise the possible collection and uses of data, without adequately specifying those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations.\n\n---\n\n[73](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref73)      According to paragraph 2 of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019, that provision supports the freedom to conduct a business, which is guaranteed by Article 16 of the Charter, and reflects the fact that sometimes the contractual obligations towards the data subject cannot be performed without the data subject providing certain personal data. I note that the second situation envisaged in that provision, pursuant to which processing is necessary in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, is not relevant in the present case. The same can be said for the question of the existence of a contract which is valid under both the applicable contract law and other legal requirements, including those relating to consumer contracts (see in particular Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ 1993 L 95, p. 29)), which is not the subject of the reference for a preliminary ruling.\n\n---\n\n[74](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref74)      See, with regard to the provision corresponding to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, contained in Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 16 December 2008, _Huber_(C‑524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraph 52).\n\n---\n\n[75](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref75)      Moreover, although merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, processing may be objectively necessary even if not specifically mentioned in the contract, without prejudice to the controller’s transparency obligations (see EDPB Guidelines 2/2019, paragraph 27).\n\n---\n\n[76](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref76)      See EDPB Guidelines 2/2019, paragraph 25.\n\n---\n\n[77](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref77)      See, to that effect, judgment of 9 November 2010, _Volker und Markus Schecke_ and _Eifert_ (C‑92/09 and C‑93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph 86), and EDPB Guidelines 2/2019, paragraph 25. Paragraphs 27 to 32 of those guidelines refer to the fact that the processing is objectively necessary for a purpose that is integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject, the controller having to be able to demonstrate how the main subject matter of the specific contract with the data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur.

Indeed, in that case, the use of the services in question would be subject to consent which is not necessary for the performance of the contract. Under Article 7(4) of the GDPR, the referring court will have to take the utmost account of that circumstance (which, according to recital 43 of the GDPR, constitutes a presumption of invalidity of the consent which the controller must rebut pursuant to Article 7(1) of the GDPR). Furthermore, such consent would not, in my view, comply with the rule whereby separate consent is required for different personal data processing operations (see the third part of point 74 of this Opinion), since there is nothing to link the user’s initial consent to the opening of the Facebook account with any consent to the processing of personal data outside Facebook. Moreover, even in the event of any subsequent consent, given specifically for the data to be used outside Facebook, it is important to consider whether the controller offers the choice of an equivalent service that does not involve consenting to data use for additional purposes (see EDPB Guidelines 5/2020 of 4 May 2020 on consent under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘EDPB Guidelines 5/2020’, paragraph 37, which also specify, in paragraph 38, that the controller cannot refer to an equivalent service offered by another operator).\n\n---\n\n[82](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref82)      As the Austrian Government points out, it seems decisive in that respect that the group’s various products can be used independently of each other and that the use of each service is based on a separate user agreement. Moreover, as the Federal Cartel Office observes, the continuous, seamless use of the group’s services, rather than being regarded as necessary for those services to function, should be regarded as being of interest to the user, such that, in principle, it would seem more appropriate that it should be at the user’s discretion.\n\n---\n\n[83](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref83)      See, by analogy, judgment of 4 May 2017, _Rīgas satiksme_ (C‑13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 28), on the equivalent provision to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR contained in Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46.\n\n---\n\n[84](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref84)      As noted in the Opinion of Advocate General Bobek in _Fashion ID_ (C‑40/17, EU:C:2018:1039, point 122), the notion of ‘legitimate interest’ under Directive 95/46 appeared to be rather elastic and open-ended. Indeed, as argued by the applicant in the main proceedings, the Court of Justice recognised several interests as being legitimate (see in particular judgments of 13 May 2014, _Google Spain_ _and_ _Google_ (C‑131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph 81); of 19 October 2016, _Breyer_ (C‑582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 55); of 4 May 2017, _Rīgas satiksme_ (C‑13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 29); of 24 September 2019, _GC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)_ (C‑136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph 53); of 11 December 2019, _Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA_ (C‑708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 59); and of 17 June 2021, _M.I.C.M._(C‑597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraphs 108 and 109). The same conclusion may be drawn, in my view, from recital 47 of the GDPR, which mentions, by way of illustration, situations in which the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller, and the processing of personal data for the purposes of preventing fraud or for direct marketing purposes, and from recital 49, which refers to network and information security and the security of the services offered.\n\n---\n\n[85](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref85)      That includes, in my view, the requirement to specify which processing operation is based on which legitimate interest.\n\n---\n\n[86](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref86)      See judgments of 4 May 2017, _Rīgas satiksme_ (C‑13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 30), and of 17 June 2021, _M.I.C.M._ (C‑597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph 110).\n\n---\n\n[87](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref87)      See, to that effect, judgments of 4 May 2017, _Rīgas satiksme_ (C‑13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 31), and of 17 June 2021, _M.I.C.M._ (C‑597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph 111). The Court of Justice recalled, in that regard, that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 (which corresponds to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) precluded Member States from excluding, categorically and in general, the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data without allowing the opposing rights and interests at issue to be balanced against each other in a particular case, specifying that Member States could not definitively prescribe, for those categories, the result of the balancing of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by virtue of the particular circumstances of an individual case (judgment of 19 October 2016, _Breyer_, C‑582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph 62 and the case-law cited).\n\n---\n\n[88](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref88)      Opinion 6/2014 of the Article 29 Working Party makes some interesting points in that regard in paragraph III.3.4.\n\n---\n\n[89](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref89)      According to recital 49 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. That could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution. I also note that, according to Article 32 of that regulation, the data controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, while Article 5(1)(f) of that regulation states that personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of the personal data.\n\n---\n\n[90](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref90)      It is necessary therefore to check to what extent the processing of personal data external to the Facebook site or app is necessary for Facebook’s security. While the referring court notes, in that respect, the possibility of using WhatsApp data in anti-spam mode (using information from WhatsApp accounts that send spam to take measures against the corresponding Facebook accounts) and Instagram data to identify dubious or unlawful behaviour, I doubt that the applicant in the main proceedings can claim the right to process personal data for ‘policing’ purposes in the broader sense, given that, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, in the (different but related) field of data relating to electronic communications, even _legislative_ measures providing, as a preventive measure, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data are not compatible with Directive 2002/58 (see judgment of 6 October 2020, _La Quadrature du Net and Others_, C‑511/18, C‑512/18 and C‑520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph 168). Besides, in the event that the need to ensure network security is a legal requirement, the controller can rely on the specific justification provided for in Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[91](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref91)      In accordance with Article 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the GDPR.\n\n---\n\n[92](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref92)      See point 48 of this Opinion.\n\n---\n\n[93](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref93)      In view of the wide range of legitimate interests recognised by the case-law (see point 60 of this Opinion). For example, in principle it seems obvious to me that the protection of minors may justify the adoption of appropriate protection measures, to prevent them from accessing inappropriate or dangerous content.\n\n---\n\n[94](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref94)      In accordance with Article 13(1)(c) and (d) of the GDPR, it is for the controller to state, for each purpose of processing, the legitimate interests pursued by it or by a third party.\n\n---\n\n[95](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref95)      In its judgment of 11 November 2020, _Orange Romania_ _(_C‑61/19, EU:C:2020:901, paragraphs 35 and 36 and the case-law cited), the Court of Justice clarified that the wording of Article 4(11) of the GDPR, which defines the ‘consent of the data subject’, appears even more stringent than Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46, in that it requires a ‘freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous’ indication of the data subject’s wishes in the form of a statement or by ‘a clear affirmative action’ signifying agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n\n---\n\n[96](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref96)      As the EDPB points out, the adjective ‘free’ implies real choice and control for data subjects (see EDPB Guidelines 5/2020, paragraph 13). The same paragraph specifies, inter alia, that consent has not been freely given if, on the one hand, the data subject feels compelled to consent or will endure _significant negative consequences_ if they do not consent, and, on the other hand, consent is presented as a _non-negotiable part of terms and conditions_. Accordingly, consent will not be considered to be free if the data subject is unable to refuse or withdraw his or her consent without detriment. In that case, as the applicant in the main proceedings points out, the only disadvantage which the data subject must accept is that the service may, where appropriate, not have the same functionality or quality, to the extent that the processing of the data for which consent has not been given is technically necessary for that purpose.\n\n---\n\n[97](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref97)      In that respect, the EDPB Guidelines 5/2020 refer to deception, intimidation, coercion or significant negative consequences if the data subject does not consent, and confirms that the controller should be able to prove that the data subject had a free or genuine choice about whether to consent and that it was possible to withdraw consent (paragraph 47).\n\n---\n\n[98](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref98)      Apart from relations with public authorities and employment relations referred to in recital 43, which are not relevant in this case, paragraph 24 of the EDPB Guidelines 5/2020 refers to situations where the data subject is unable to exercise a real choice, or where there is a risk of deception, intimidation, coercion or significant negative consequences (for example, substantial extra costs) if he or she does not consent.\n\n---\n\n[99](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref99)      That question overlaps, in part, with the one that is the subject of the first part of the third question referred for a preliminary ruling (see points 53 to 57 of this Opinion). The second sentence of recital 43 of the GDPR specifies that, in such a situation, consent is presumed not to be freely given (paragraph 26 of the EDPB Guidelines 5/2020 states that in doing so, the GDPR ensures that the processing of personal data for which consent is sought cannot become directly or indirectly the counter-performance of a contract), since the use of the word ‘presumed’ clearly indicates that the cases in which consent is valid will be highly exceptional (see paragraph 35 of the guidelines). Moreover, Article 7(4) of the GDPR has been drafted in a non-exhaustive fashion by the words ‘inter alia’, meaning that there may be a range of other situations which are caught by that provision, including any inappropriate pressure or influence upon the data subject which prevents him or her from exercising his or her free will (EDPB Guidelines 5/2020, paragraph 14).\n\n---\n\n[100](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref100)      Recital 32 of the GDPR states, inter alia, that consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes and that when the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. In that respect, the EDPB Guidelines 5/2020 refer to the ‘granularity’ of consent as an obstacle to its freedom (paragraph 44).\n\n---\n\n[101](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref101)      Such a situation favours conditions that are not necessary for the performance of the contract (see points 53 to 57 of this Opinion).\n\n---\n\n[102](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref102)      As the Commission observes, the degree of relative market power of the undertaking that is critical for consent to be valid under the GDPR cannot necessarily be equated with the threshold for market dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU.\n\n---\n\n[103](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footref103)      Although the existence of a dominant position alone does not preclude the possibility of consent to the processing of personal data being freely given, the absence of such a position is not, on its own, a sufficient guarantee that such consent is valid in all circumstances.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.895788352Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/CJEU":{"title":"","content":"\nProvisional text\n\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber)\n\n4 July 2023 ([*](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=req\u0026pageIndex=0\u0026docid=275125\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=1636759#Footnote*))\n\n\n\nREQUEST for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU from the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany), made by decision of 24 March 2021, received at the Court on 22 April 2021, in the proceedings\n\n**Meta Platforms Inc.,** formerly Facebook Inc.,\n\n**Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd,** formerly Facebook Ireland Ltd,\n\n**Facebook Deutschland GmbH**\n\nv\n\n**Bundeskartellamt,**\n\nintervener:\n\n**Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband eV,**\n\nTHE COURT (Grand Chamber),\n\ncomposed of K. Lenaerts, President, L. Bay Larsen, Vice-President, A. Prechal, K. Jürimäe, C. Lycourgos, M. Safjan, L.S. Rossi (Rapporteur), D. Gratsias and M.L. Arastey Sahún, Presidents of Chambers, J.-C. Bonichot, S. Rodin, F. Biltgen, M. Gavalec, Z. Csehi and O. Spineanu-Matei, Judges,\n\nAdvocate General: A. Rantos,\n\nRegistrar: D. Dittert, Head of Unit,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 10 May 2022,\n\nafter considering the observations submitted on behalf of:\n\n–        Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, formerly Facebook Ireland Ltd, and Facebook Deutschland GmbH, by M. Braun, M. Esser, L. Hesse, J. Höft and H.-G. Kamann, Rechtsanwälte,\n\n–        the Bundeskartellamt, by J. Nothdurft, K. Ost, I. Sewczyk and J. Topel, acting as Agents,\n\n–        Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband eV, by S. Louven, Rechtsanwalt,\n\n–        the German Government, by J. Möller and P.-L. Krüger, acting as Agents,\n\n–        the Czech Government, by M. Smolek and J. Vláčil, acting as Agents,\n\n–        the Italian Government, by G. Palmieri, acting as Agent, and E. De Bonis and P. Gentili, avvocati dello Stato,\n\n–        the Austrian Government, by A. Posch, J. Schmoll and G. Kunnert, acting as Agents,\n\n–        the European Commission, by F. Erlbacher, H. Kranenborg and G. Meessen, acting as Agents,\n\nafter hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 20 September 2022,\n\ngives the following\n\n**Judgment**\n\n1        This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 4(3) TEU and of Article 6(1), Article 9(1) and (2), Article 51(1) and Article 56(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ 2016 L 119, p. 1, and corrigendum OJ 2018 L 127, p. 2;

Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the “Charter”) and Article 16(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\n…\n\n(4)      The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\n…\n\n(38)      Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.\n\n…\n\n(42)      Where processing is based on the data subject’s consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation. … For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\n(43)      In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.\n\n…\n\n(46)      The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n\n(47)      The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. … At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. … The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.\n\n…\n\n(49)      The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems … constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. …\n\n…\n\n(51)      Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term “racial origin” in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the [European] Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.’\n\n5        Article 4 of that regulation provides:\n\n‘For the purposes of this Regulation:\n\n(1)      “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); …\n\n(2)      “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\n…\n\n(7)      “controller” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;\n\n…\n\n(11)      “consent” of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;\n\n…\n\n(23)      “cross-border processing” means either:\n\n(a)      processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State; or\n\n(b)      processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State.\n\n…’\n\n6        Article 5 of that regulation, headed ‘Principles relating to processing of personal data’, provides:\n\n‘1.      Personal data shall be:\n\n(a)      processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (“lawfulness, fairness and transparency”);\n\n(b)      collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; …\n\n(c)      adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimisation”);\n\n…\n\n2.      The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (“accountability”).’\n\n7        Article 6 of the regulation, entitled ‘Lawfulness of processing’, reads as follows:\n\n‘1.      Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\n\n(a)      the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n\n(b)      processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\n(c)      processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\n(d)      processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\n(e)      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\n(f)      processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nPoint (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.\n\n…\n\n3.      The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:\n\n(a)      Union law; or\n\n(b)      Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n\n…\n\n… The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.’\n\n8        Article 7 of the GDPR, entitled ‘Conditions for consent’, states:\n\n‘1.      Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.\n\n…\n\n4.      When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.’\n\n9        Article 9 of that regulation, entitled ‘Processing of special categories of personal data’, provides:\n\n‘1.      Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.\n\n2.      Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\n\n(a)      the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law [provides] that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;\n\n…\n\n(e)      processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\n\n(f)      processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;\n\n…’\n\n10      Article 13 of that regulation, ‘Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject’, provides, in its paragraph 1, as follows:\n\n‘Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:\n\n…\n\n(c)      the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n\n(d)      where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n\n…’\n\n11      Chapter VI of the GDPR, ‘Independent supervisory authorities’, comprises Articles 51 to 59 of the regulation.\n\n12      Under Article 51(1) and (2) of the GDPR, that article being entitled ‘Supervisory authority’:\n\n‘1.      Each Member State shall provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union …\n\n2.      Each supervisory authority shall contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union. For that purpose, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and the [European] Commission in accordance with Chapter VII.’\n\n13      As set out in Article 55 of the GDPR, headed ‘Competence’:\n\n‘1.      Each supervisory authority shall be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation on the territory of its own Member State.\n\n2.      Where processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting on the basis of point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1), the supervisory authority of the Member State concerned shall be competent. In such cases Article 56 does not apply.’\n\n14      Article 56(1) of that regulation, that article being entitled ‘Competence of the lead supervisory authority’, states:\n\n‘Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 60.’\n\n15      Article 57(1) of that regulation, that article being entitled ‘Tasks’, provides:\n\n‘Without prejudice to other tasks set out under this Regulation, each supervisory authority shall on its territory:\n\n(a)      monitor and enforce the application of this Regulation;\n\n…\n\n(g)      cooperate with, including sharing information[,] and provide mutual assistance to, other supervisory authorities with a view to ensuring the consistency of application and enforcement of this Regulation;\n\n…’\n\n16      Article 58 of the regulation lists, in paragraph 1, the investigative powers available to each supervisory authority and states, in paragraph 5, that ‘each Member State shall provide by law that its supervisory authority shall have the power to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and where appropriate, to commence or engage otherwise in legal proceedings, in order to enforce the provisions of this Regulation’.\n\n17      Section 1, entitled ‘Cooperation’, of Chapter VII of the GDPR comprises Articles 60 to 62 of that regulation. Article 60, ‘Cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned’, provides in paragraph 1:\n\n‘The lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an endeavour to reach consensus. The lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned shall exchange all relevant information with each other.’\n\n18      Article 61(1) of the GDPR, that article being headed ‘Mutual assistance’, states:\n\n‘Supervisory authorities shall provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply this Regulation in a consistent manner, and shall put in place measures for effective cooperation with one another. Mutual assistance shall cover, in particular, information requests and supervisory measures, such as requests to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations.’\n\n19      Article 62 of that regulation, headed ‘Joint operations of supervisory authorities’, provides in paragraphs 1 and 2:\n\n‘1.      The supervisory authorities shall, where appropriate, conduct joint operations including joint investigations and joint enforcement measures in which members or staff of the supervisory authorities of other Member States are involved.\n\n2.      Where the controller or processor has establishments in several Member States or where a significant number of data subjects in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected by processing operations, a supervisory authority of each of those Member States shall have the right to participate in joint operations. …’\n\n20      Section 2, entitled ‘Consistency’, of Chapter VII of the GDPR comprises Articles 63 to 67 of that regulation. Article 63, headed ‘Consistency mechanism’, is worded as follows:\n\n‘In order to contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission, through the consistency mechanism as set out in this Section.’\n\n21      Article 64(2) of that regulation is worded as follows:\n\n‘Any supervisory authority, the Chair of the [European Data Protection] Board or the Commission may request that any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one Member State be examined by the [European Data Protection] Board with a view to obtaining an opinion, in particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 or for joint operations in accordance with Article 62.’\n\n22      Article 65(1) of that regulation, that article being headed ‘Dispute resolution by the Board’, provides:\n\n‘In order to ensure the correct and consistent application of this Regulation in individual cases, the [European Data Protection] Board shall adopt a binding decision in the following cases:\n\n(a)      where, in a case referred to in Article 60(4), a supervisory authority concerned has raised a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the lead supervisory authority and the lead supervisory authority has not followed the objection or has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned. The binding decision shall concern all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objection, in particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation;\n\n(b)      where there are conflicting views on which of the supervisory authorities concerned is competent for the main establishment;\n\n…’\n\n _**German law**_\n\n23      Paragraph 19(1) of the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (Law against restrictions on competition), in its version published on 26 June 2013 (BGBl. 2013 I, p. 1750, 3245), last amended by Paragraph 2 of the Law of 16 July 2021 (BGBl. 2021 I, p. 2959) (‘the GWB’), provides:\n\n‘The abuse of a dominant position by one or more undertakings is prohibited.’\n\n24      In accordance with Paragraph 32(1) of the GWB:\n\n‘The competition authority may require undertakings or associations of undertakings to bring to an end an infringement of a provision of this Part or of Articles 101 or 102 [TFEU].’\n\n25      Paragraph 50f(1) of the GWB provides:\n\n‘The competition authorities, the regulatory authorities, the federal data protection and freedom of information officer, the regional data protection officers and the competent authorities within the meaning of Paragraph 2 of the EU-Verbraucherschutzdurchführungsgesetz [(Law on the implementation of EU consumer protection law)] may, irrespective of the procedure chosen, exchange information, including personal data and trade and business secrets, to the extent necessary for the performance of their respective tasks and may use that information in the course of their proceedings. …’\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n26      Meta Platforms Ireland operates the online social network Facebook within the European Union and promotes, inter alia via www.facebook.com, services that are free of charge for private users. Other undertakings of the Meta group offer, within the European Union, other online services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.\n\n==27      The business model of the online social network Facebook is based on financing through online advertising, which is tailored to the individual users of the social network according, inter alia, to their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Such advertising is made possible in technical terms by the automated production of detailed profiles in respect of the network users and the users of the online services offered at the level of the Meta group.== To that end, in addition to the data provided by the users directly when they sign up for the online services concerned, ==other user- and device-related data are also collected on and off that social network and the online services provided by the Meta group, and linked to their various user accounts==. The aggregate view of the data allows detailed conclusions to be drawn about those users’ preferences and interests. ^0c0001\n\n28      For the processing of those data, Meta Platforms Ireland relies on the user agreement to which the users of the social network Facebook adhere when they click on the ‘Sign up’ button, thereby accepting the general terms drawn up by that company. Acceptance of those terms is necessary in order to be able to use the social network Facebook. With regard to the processing of personal data, the general terms refer to that company’s data and cookies policies. According to those policies, Meta Platforms Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and links the data with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned. ==The latter data, relating to activities outside the social network (‘the off-Facebook data’), are data concerning visits to third-party webpages and apps, which are linked to Facebook through programming interfaces – ‘Facebook Business Tools’ – as well as data concerning the use of other online services belonging to the Meta group, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.== ^10a2d0\n\n29      The Federal Cartel Office brought proceedings against Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland, as a result of which, by decision of 6 February 2019, based on Paragraph 19(1) and Paragraph 32 of the GWB, it essentially prohibited those companies from making, in the general terms, ==the use of the social network Facebook by private users resident in Germany subject to the processing of their off-Facebook data and from processing the data without their consent on the basis of the general terms in force at the time==. In addition, it required them to adapt those general terms in such a way that it is made clear that those data will neither be collected, nor linked with Facebook user accounts nor used without the consent of the user concerned, and it clarified the fact that such a consent is not valid if it is a condition for using the social network.\n\n30      The Federal Cartel Office based its decision on the fact that the processing of the data of the users concerned, as provided for in the general terms and implemented by Meta Platforms Ireland, constituted an abuse of that company’s dominant position on the market for online social networks for private users in Germany, within the meaning of Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB. In particular, according to the Federal Cartel Office, those general terms, as a result of that dominant position, constitute an abuse since the processing of the off-Facebook data that they provide for is not consistent with the underlying values of the GDPR and, in particular, it cannot be justified in the light of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2) of that regulation.\n\n31      On 11 February 2019, Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland brought an action against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office before the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany).\n\n32      On 31 July 2019, Meta Platforms Ireland introduced new general terms expressly stating that the user, instead of paying to use Facebook products, agrees to being shown advertisements.\n\n33      Furthermore, since 28 January 2020, Meta Platforms has been offering, at a global level, ‘_Off-Facebook Activity_’, which allows the users of the social network Facebook to view a summary of the information about them that Meta group companies obtain in relation to their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect the data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish.\n\n34      The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) has doubts (i) as to whether national competition authorities may review, in the exercise of their powers, whether the processing of personal data complies with the requirements set out in the GDPR; (ii) as to whether the operator of an online social network may process the data subject’s sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation; (iii) as to the lawfulness of the processing by such an operator of the personal data of the user concerned, under Article 6(1) of that regulation; and (iv) as to the validity, in the light of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of that regulation, of the consent given to an undertaking with a dominant position on the national market for online social networks for the purposes of such processing. \n\n35      In those circumstances, taking the view that the resolution of the case in the main proceedings depends on the answer to those questions, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘(1)      (a)      Is it compatible with Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR if a national competition authority – such as the … Federal Cartel Office – which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR, of a Member State in which an undertaking established outside the European Union has an establishment that provides the main establishment of that undertaking – which is located in another Member State and has sole responsibility for processing personal data for the entire territory of the European Union – with advertising, communication and public relations support, finds, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, that the main establishment’s contractual terms relating to data processing and their implementation breach the GDPR and issues an order to end that breach?\n\n(b)      If so: is that compatible with Article 4(3) TEU if, at the same time, the lead supervisory authority in the Member State in which the main establishment, within the meaning of Article 56(1) of the GDPR, is located is investigating the undertaking’s contractual terms relating to data processing?\n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is “yes”:\n\n(2)      (a)      If an internet user merely visits websites or apps to which the criteria of Article 9(1) of the GDPR relate, such as flirting apps, gay dating sites, political party websites or health-related websites, or also enters information into them, for example when registering or when placing orders, and [an] undertaking, such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland], uses interfaces integrated into those websites and apps, such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, to collect data about those visits to the websites and apps and the information entered by the user, and links those data with the data from the user’s Facebook_._com account and uses them, does this collection and/or linking and/or use involve the processing of sensitive data for the purpose of that provision?\n\n(b)      If so: does visiting those websites or apps and/or entering information and/or clicking or tapping on the buttons integrated into them by a provider such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland] (social plugins such as “Like”, “Share” or “Facebook Login” or “Account Kit”) constitute manifestly making the data about the visits themselves and/or the information entered by the user public within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR?\n\n(3)      Can an undertaking, such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland], which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and consistent, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group ==services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them==, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?\n\n(4)      In those circumstances, can\n\n–        the fact of users being underage, vis-à-vis the personalisation of content and advertising, product improvement, network security and non-marketing communications intended for the user;\n\n–        the provision of measurements, analytics and other business services to enable advertisers, developers and other partners to evaluate and improve their services;\n\n–        the provision of marketing communications intended for the user to enable the undertaking to improve its products and engage in direct marketing;\n\n–        research and innovation for social good, to further the state of the art or the academic understanding of important social issues and to affect society and the world in a positive way;\n\n–        the sharing of information with law-enforcement agencies and responding to legal requests in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, unlawful use, breaches of the terms of service and policies and other harmful behaviour;\n\nalso constitute legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR if, for those purposes, the undertaking [collects data from other group services and from third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, links those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and uses them]?\n\n(5)      In those circumstances, can collecting data from other group services and from third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them, or using data already collected and linked by other lawful means, also be justified under Article 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the GDPR in individual cases, for example to respond to a legitimate request for certain data (point (c)), to combat harmful behaviour and promote security (point (d)), to research for social good and to promote safety, integrity and security (point (e))?\n\n(6)      Can consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR be given effectively and, in accordance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR in particular, freely, to a dominant undertaking such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland]?\n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is “no”:\n\n(7)      (a)      Can the national competition authority of a Member State, such as the Federal Cartel Office, which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR and which examines a breach by a dominant undertaking of the competition-law prohibition on abuse that is not a breach of the GDPR by that undertaking’s data processing terms and their implementation, make findings, when assessing the balance of interests, as to whether those data processing terms and their implementation comply with the GDPR?\n\n(b)      If so: in the light of Article 4(3) TEU, does that also apply if the competent lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(1) of the GDPR is investigating the undertaking’s data processing terms at the same time?\n\nIf the answer to Question 7 is “yes”, Questions 3 to 5 must be answered in relation to data from the use of the group’s Instagram service.’\n\n **The questions referred**\n\n _**Questions 1 and 7**_\n\n36      By Questions 1 and 7, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, that that undertaking’s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with the GDPR, and if so, whether Article 4(3) TEU must be interpreted as meaning that such a finding, of an incidental nature, by the competition authority is also possible where those terms are being investigated, simultaneously, by the competent lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(1) of the GDPR.\n\n37      In order to answer that question, it is important to recall at the outset that Article 55(1) of the GDPR states the general rule that each supervisory authority is to be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State (judgment of 15 June 2021, _Facebook Ireland and Others_, C‑645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).\n\n38      The tasks assigned to those supervisory authorities include monitoring and enforcing the application of the GDPR, as provided for in Article 51(1) and Article 57(1)(a) of that regulation, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of such data within the European Union. In addition, in accordance with Article 51(2) and Article 57(1)(g) of that regulation, the supervisory authorities must cooperate with each other, including sharing information, and provide mutual assistance with a view to ensuring the consistency of application and enforcement of the regulation.\n\n39      In order to carry out those tasks, Article 58 of the GDPR confers on those supervisory authorities, in paragraph 1, investigative powers, in paragraph 2, corrective powers, and in paragraph 5, the power to bring infringements of that regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, to commence legal proceedings in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation.\n\n40      Without prejudice to the rule on competence set out in Article 55(1) of the GDPR, Article 56(1) of that regulation lays down, with respect to ‘cross-border processing’, within the meaning of Article 4(23) of that regulation, the ‘one-stop-shop mechanism’, based on an allocation of competences between one ‘lead supervisory authority’ and the other supervisory authorities concerned as well as on cooperation between all of those authorities in accordance with the cooperation procedure laid down in Article 60 of that regulation.\n\n41      Furthermore, Article 61(1) of the GDPR obliges the supervisory authorities, inter alia, to provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply that regulation in a consistent manner throughout the European Union. Article 63 of the GDPR states that it was for that purpose that provision was made for the consistency mechanism set out in Articles 64 and 65 of that regulation (judgment of 15 June 2021, _Facebook Ireland and Others_, C‑645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).\n\n42      That said, it should be noted that the rules on cooperation laid down in the GDPR are not addressed to the national competition authorities but govern cooperation between the national supervisory authorities concerned and the lead supervisory authority as well as, where appropriate, cooperation between those authorities and the European Data Protection Board and the Commission.\n\n==43      Neither the GDPR nor any other instrument of EU law provides for specific rules on cooperation between a national competition authority and the relevant national supervisory authorities concerned or the lead supervisory authority. Furthermore, there is no provision in that regulation that prevents the national competition authorities from finding, in the performance of their duties, that a data processing operation carried out by an undertaking in a dominant position and liable to constitute an abuse of that position does not comply with that regulation.\n\n==44      In that regard, it should be made clear, in the first place, that the supervisory authorities, on the one hand, and the national competition authorities, on the other, perform different functions and pursue their own objectives and tasks.== **JUST SA STUFF**\n\n45      On the one hand, as has been stated in paragraph 38 above, under Article 51(1) and (2) and Article 57(1)(a) and (g) of the GDPR, the primary task of the supervisory authority is to monitor and enforce the application of that regulation, while contributing to its consistent application within the European Union, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of such data within the European Union. To that end, as recalled in paragraph 39 above, the supervisory authority has at its disposal the various powers conferred on it under Article 58 of the GDPR.\n\n46      On the other hand, in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation No 1/2003, the national competition authorities have the power to take, inter alia, decisions finding an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking, within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, whose objective is to establish a system which ensures that competition in the internal market is not distorted, having regard also to the consequences of such an abuse for consumers in that market.\n\n47      As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 23 of his Opinion, when taking such a decision, a competition authority must assess, on the basis of all the specific circumstances of the case, whether, by resorting to methods different from those governing normal competition in products or services, the conduct of the dominant undertaking has the effect of hindering the maintenance of the degree of competition existing in the market or the growth of that competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 March 2021, _Deutsche Telekom_ v _Commission_, C‑152/19 P, EU:C:2021:238, paragraphs 41 and 42). ==In that respect, the compliance or non-compliance of that conduct with the provisions of the GDPR may, depending on the circumstances, be a vital clue among the relevant circumstances of the case in order to establish whether that conduct entails resorting to methods governing normal competition and to assess the consequences of a certain practice in the market or for consumers.==\n\n==48      It follows that, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking on a particular market, it may be necessary for the competition authority of the Member State concerned also to examine whether that undertaking’s conduct complies with rules other than those relating to competition law, such as the rules on the protection of personal data laid down by the GDPR.==\n\n49      In view of the different objectives pursued by the rules established in competition matters, in particular Article 102 TFEU, on the one hand, and those laid down in relation to the protection of personal data under the GDPR, on the other, it must be held that, where a national competition authority identifies an infringement of that regulation in the context of the finding of an abuse of a dominant position, it does not replace the supervisory authorities. In particular, that national competition authority neither monitors nor enforces the application of that regulation for the purpose referred to in Article 51(1) of the GDPR, namely in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing or to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the European Union. Furthermore, ==by merely noting the non-compliance of a data processing operation with the GDPR for the sole purpose of establishing an abuse of a dominant position and by imposing measures to put an end to that abuse on a legal basis derived from competition law, that authority does not carry out any of the tasks set out in Article 57 of that regulation, nor does it make use of the powers reserved to the supervisory authority under Article 58 of that regulation.==\n\n50      Moreover, it is important to state that access to and use of personal data are of great importance in the context of the digital economy. That importance is illustrated, in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings, by the business model on which the social network Facebook relies, which, as recalled in paragraph 27 above, provides for financing through the marketing of personalised advertising messages according to user profiles established on the basis of personal data collected by Meta Platforms Ireland.\n\n51      As pointed out by the Commission, inter alia, access to personal data and the fact that it is possible to process such data have become a significant parameter of competition between undertakings in the digital economy. Therefore, excluding the rules on the protection of personal data from the legal framework to be taken into consideration by the competition authorities when examining an abuse of a dominant position would disregard the reality of this economic development and would be liable to undermine the effectiveness of competition law within the European Union.\n\n52      However, in the second place, it should be noted that, where a national competition authority considers it necessary to rule, in the context of a decision on an abuse of a dominant position, on the compliance or non-compliance with the GDPR of the processing of personal data by the undertaking in question, that authority and the supervisory authority concerned or, where appropriate, the competent lead supervisory authority within the meaning of that regulation must cooperate with each other in order to ensure the consistency of application of that regulation.\n\n==53      Although, as has been noted in paragraphs 42 and 43 above, neither the GDPR nor any other instrument of EU law provides for specific rules in that regard, the fact remains that, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 28 of his Opinion, when they apply the GDPR, the various national authorities involved are all bound by the duty of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) TEU. Under that principle, in accordance with settled case-law, in areas covered by EU law, Member States, including their administrative authorities, must assist each other, in full mutual respect, in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties,== take any appropriate measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising from, inter alia, the acts of the institutions of the European Union and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the European Union’s objectives (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 November 2013, _UPC Nederland_, C‑158/11, EU:C:2013:709, paragraph 59, and of 1 August 2022, _Sea Watch_, C‑14/21 and C‑15/21, EU:C:2022:604, paragraph 156).\n\n==54      Thus, in the light of this principle, when national competition authorities are called upon, in the exercise of their powers, to examine whether an undertaking’s conduct is consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, they are required to consult and cooperate sincerely with the national supervisory authorities concerned or with the lead supervisory authority, all of which are then bound, in that context, to observe their respective powers and competences, in such a way as to ensure that the obligations arising from the GDPR and the objectives of that regulation are complied with while their effectiveness is safeguarded.==\n\n55      The examination by a competition authority of an undertaking’s conduct in the light of the provisions of the GDPR may entail the risk of divergences between that authority and the supervisory authorities in the interpretation of that regulation.\n\n56      It follows that, where, in the context of the examination seeking to establish whether there is an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU by an undertaking, a national competition authority takes the view that it is necessary to examine whether that undertaking’s conduct is consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, that authority must ascertain whether that conduct or similar conduct has already been the ==subject of a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the lead supervisory authority or the Court. If that is the case, the national competition authority cannot depart from it, although it remains free to draw its own conclusions from the point of view of the application of competition law.==\n\n57      Where it has doubts as to the scope of the assessment carried out by the competent national supervisory authority or the lead supervisory authority, where the conduct in question or similar conduct is, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of investigation by those authorities, it takes the view that an undertaking’s conduct is not consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, the national competition authority must consult and seek their cooperation in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for the supervisory authority concerned to take a decision before starting its own assessment.\n\n58      For its part, where the supervisory authority is called upon by a national competition authority, it must respond to such a request for information or cooperation within a reasonable period of time, providing the latter with the information in its possession capable of dispelling that authority’s doubts as to the scope of the assessment carried out by the supervisory authority or, where appropriate, by informing the national competition authority if it intends to initiate the cooperation procedure with the other supervisory authorities concerned or with the lead supervisory authority, in accordance with Article 60 et seq. of the GDPR, in order to reach a decision seeking to establish whether or not the conduct in question is consistent with that regulation.\n\n59      In the absence of a reply, within a reasonable time, from the supervisory authority thus called upon, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation. The same applies where the competent national supervisory authority and the lead supervisory authority have no objection to such an investigation being continued without having to wait for a decision on their part.\n\n60      In the present case, it is apparent from the file before the Court that in October and November 2018, that is to say, before the adoption of the decision of 6 February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office contacted the Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit (BfDI) (Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Germany), the Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Hamburg, Germany), which is the competent authority for Facebook Deutschland, and the Data Protection Commission (DPC) (Ireland), to notify those authorities of the action it had taken. In addition, it is apparent that the Federal Cartel Office obtained confirmation that no investigation was being conducted at the time by those authorities in relation to facts similar to those at issue in the main proceedings, and they raised no objection to its actions. Finally, in paragraphs 555 and 556 of its decision of 6 February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office expressly referred to that cooperation.\n\n61      In those circumstances, and subject to verification by the referring court, the Federal Cartel Office appears to have fulfilled its obligations of sincere cooperation with the national supervisory authorities concerned and the lead supervisory authority.\n\n62      In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Questions 1 and 7 is that Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR and Article 4(3) TEU must be interpreted as meaning that, subject to compliance with its duty of sincere cooperation with the supervisory authorities, a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, that that undertaking’s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with that regulation, where that finding is necessary to establish the existence of such an abuse.\n\n63      In view of this duty of sincere cooperation, the national competition authority cannot depart from a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the competent lead supervisory authority concerning those general terms or similar general terms. Where it has doubts as to the scope of such a decision, where those terms or similar terms are, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of an investigation or decision by those authorities, the competition authority takes the view that the terms in question are not consistent with the GDPR, it must consult and seek the cooperation of those supervisory authorities in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for them to take a decision before starting its own assessment. In the absence of any objection on their part or of any reply within a reasonable time, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation.\n\n _**Q****uestion** **2**_\n\n64      By Question 2(a), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 9(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection – by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies – of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user’s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as ‘processing of special categories of personal data’ within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article 9(2).\n\n65      If so, the referring court asks, in essence, by Question 2(b), whether Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which the categories set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR relate, enters information into those sites or apps or clicks or taps on the buttons integrated into them, such as the ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons or the buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using the login credentials linked to his or her online social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, the user is deemed to have manifestly made public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data collected on that occasion by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies.\n\n _Question 2(a)_\n\n66      Recital 51 of the GDPR states that personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. That recital further states that such personal data should not be processed unless processing is allowed in the specific cases set out in that regulation.\n\n67      In that context, Article 9(1) of the GDPR lays down the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data listed therein is prohibited. This includes data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs and data concerning health or a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.\n\n68      For the purposes of applying Article 9(1) of the GDPR, it is important to determine, where personal data is processed by the operator of an online social network, if those data allow information falling within one of the categories referred to in that provision to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person. If so, then such processing of personal data is prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article 9(2) of the GDPR.\n\n69      As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points 40 and 41 of his Opinion, that fundamental prohibition, laid down in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, is independent of whether or not the information revealed by the processing operation in question is correct and of whether the controller is acting with the aim of obtaining information that falls within one of the special categories referred to in that provision.\n\n70      In view of the significant risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects arising from any processing of personal data falling within the categories referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, the objective thereof is to prohibit such processing, irrespective of its stated purpose.\n\n71      In the present case, the processing operation at issue in the main proceedings carried out by Meta Platforms Ireland entails, first of all, the collection of personal data of the users of the social network Facebook when they visit websites or apps – including those that may reveal information falling within one or more of the categories referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR – and, as the case may be, they enter information into them when they register or place online orders, then the linking of those data with those users’ social network accounts and, lastly, the use of those data.\n\n72      In that regard, it will be for the referring court to determine whether the data thus collected, on their own or by linking them with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned, actually allow such information to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person. However, given the referring court’s questions, it should be made clear that it appears, subject to verification by that court, that the processing of data relating to visits to the websites or apps in question may, in certain cases, reveal such information without it being necessary for those users to enter information into them when they register or place online orders.\n\n73      In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 2(a) is that Article 9(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection – by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies – of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user’s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as ‘processing of special categories of personal data’ within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article 9(2), where that data processing allows information falling within one of those categories to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person.\n\n _Question 2(b)_\n\n74      As regards Question 2(b), as reformulated in paragraph 65 above and which relates to the derogation laid down in Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, it must be recalled that, under that provision, the fundamental prohibition of any processing of special categories of personal data, established in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, does not apply in the circumstance where the processing relates to personal data which are ‘manifestly made public by the data subject’.\n\n75      As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, first, the derogation applies only to data which are manifestly made public ‘by the data subject’. Accordingly, it is not applicable to data concerning persons other than the person who made those data public.\n\n76      Second, in so far as it provides for an exception to the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited, Article 9(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 September 2014, _Baltic Agro_, C‑3/13, EU:C:2014:2227, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited, and of 6 June 2019, _Weil_, C‑361/18, EU:C:2019:473, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).\n\n77      It follows that, for the purposes of the application of the exception laid down in Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, it is important to ascertain whether the data subject had intended, explicitly and by a clear affirmative action, to make the personal data in question accessible to the general public.\n\n78      In that regard, as regards, first, visits to websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR relate, it should be noted that the user concerned does not in any way thereby intend to make public the fact that he or she has visited those sites or apps and the data from those visits which can be linked to his or her person. The latter can at most expect the operator of the site or app to have access to those data and to share them, as the case may be and subject to that user’s explicit consent, with certain third parties and not with the general public.\n\n79      Thus, it cannot be inferred from the mere visit to such websites or apps by a user that the personal data in question were manifestly made public by that user within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR.\n\n80      Second, as regards the entering of information into those websites or apps and the clicking or tapping on buttons integrated into them, such as the ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on a website or app using the login credentials linked to his or her Facebook user account, his or her telephone number or email address, it should be noted that these actions mean that the user interacts with the website or app in question, and, as the case may be, the website of the online social network, whereby the extent to which that interaction is public may vary in that it may be determined by the individual settings chosen by that user.\n\n81      In those circumstances, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether it is possible for the users concerned to decide, on the basis of settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, whether to make the information entered into the websites or apps in question and the data from clicking or tapping on buttons integrated into them accessible to the general public or, rather, to a more or less limited number of selected persons.\n\n82      When the users concerned actually have that choice, they can be regarded, when they voluntarily enter information into a website or app or when they click or tap on buttons integrated into them, as manifestly making public, within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, data relating to them only in the circumstance where, on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, those users have clearly made the choice to have the data made accessible to an unlimited number of persons, which it is for the referring court to ascertain.\n\n83      By contrast, if no such individual settings are available, it must be held, in the light of what has been stated in paragraph 77 above, that, where users voluntarily enter information into a website or app or click or tap on buttons integrated into them, they must, in order to be deemed to have manifestly made those data public, have explicitly consented, on the basis of express information provided by that site or app prior to any such entering or clicking or tapping, to the data being viewed by any person having access to that site or app.\n\n84      In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 2(b) is that Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR relate, the user does not manifestly make public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data relating to those visits collected by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies.\n\n85      Where he or she enters information into such websites or apps or where he or she clicks or taps on buttons integrated into those sites and apps, such as the ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using login credentials linked to his or her social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, that user manifestly makes public, within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e), the data thus entered or resulting from the clicking or tapping on those buttons only in the circumstance where he or she has explicitly made the choice beforehand, as the case may be on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, to make the data relating to him or her publicly accessible to an unlimited number of persons.\n\n _**Q****uestions** **3 to 5**_\n\n86      By Questions 3 and 4, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether and under what conditions points (b) and (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of such data, may be considered to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of point (b), or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of point (f). That court asks, in particular, whether, to that end, certain interests which it explicitly lists constitute ‘legitimate interests’ within the meaning of the latter provision.\n\n87      By Question 5, the referring court asks, in essence, whether points (c) to (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing of personal data can be regarded as necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, within the meaning of point (c), in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e), where such processing is carried out, respectively, in order to respond to a legitimate request for certain data, to combat harmful behaviour and promote security, and to research for social good and promote safety, integrity and security.\n\n _Preliminary observations_\n\n88      As a preliminary point, it must be observed, first, that Questions 3 to 5 are raised on account of the fact that, according to the findings of the Federal Cartel Office in its decision of 6 February 2019, the users of the social network Facebook cannot be regarded as having given their consent to the processing of their data at issue in the main proceedings, within the meaning of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. It is therefore in that context that the referring court, while asking the Court by Question 6 in relation to that premiss, considers that it must ascertain whether that processing corresponds to one of the other conditions of lawfulness referred to in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1)of that regulation.\n\n89      In that context, it should be noted that the operations entailing the collection, the linking and the use of the data, referred to in Questions 3 to 5, may include both sensitive data within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR and non-sensitive data. It must be made clear that, where a set of data containing both sensitive data and non-sensitive data is subject to such operations and is, in particular, collected _en bloc_ without it being possible to separate the data items from each other at the time of collection, the processing of that set of data must be regarded as being prohibited, within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR, if it contains at least one sensitive data item and none of the derogations in Article 9(2) of that regulation applies.\n\n90      Second, in order to answer Questions 3 to 5, it should be recalled that the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in that provision (judgment of 22 June 2021, _Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)_, C‑439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 99 and the case-law cited).\n\n91      Under point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation, the processing of personal data is lawful if and to the extent that the data subject has given consent for one or more specific purposes.\n\n92      In the absence of such consent, or where that consent is not freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, within the meaning of Article 4(11) of the GDPR, such processing is nevertheless justified where it meets one of the requirements of necessity mentioned in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation.\n\n==93      In that context, the justifications provided for in that latter provision, in so far as they allow the processing of personal data carried out in the absence of the data subject’s consent to be made lawful, must be interpreted restrictively (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 February 2022, _Valsts ieņēmumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)_, C‑175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph 73 and the case-law cited).==\n\n94      Furthermore, as the Court has held, where it can be found that the processing of personal data is necessary in respect of one of the justifications provided for in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, it is not necessary to determine whether that processing also falls within the scope of another of those justifications (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 August 2022, _Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija_, C‑184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph 71).\n\n95      It should finally be noted that, in accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR, the controller bears the burden of proving that those data are collected, inter alia, for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and that they are processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. In addition, according to Article 13(1)(c) of that regulation, where personal data are collected from the data subject, the controller must inform the data subject of the purposes of the processing for which those data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.\n\n96      Although it is for the referring court to determine whether the various elements of the processing at issue in the main proceedings are justified by one or other of the necessity requirements referred to in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, the Court can nevertheless provide it with useful guidance to enable it to resolve the dispute before it.\n\n _Questions 3 and 4_\n\n97      As regards, in the first place, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract’.\n\n98      In that regard, in order for the processing of personal data to be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract, within the meaning of that provision, it must be objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for the data subject. The controller must therefore be able to demonstrate how the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if the processing in question does not occur.\n\n99      The fact that such processing may be referred to in the contract or may be merely useful for the performance of the contract is, in itself, irrelevant in that regard. The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be essential for the proper performance of the contract concluded between the controller and the data subject and, therefore, that there are no workable, less intrusive alternatives.\n\n100    In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point 54 of his Opinion, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately.\n\n101    In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of that provision, the referring court mentions, as elements intended to ensure the proper performance of the contract concluded between Meta Platforms Ireland and its users, personalised content and the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services.\n\n102    As regards, first, the justification based on personalised content, it is important to note that, although such a personalisation is useful to the user, in so far as it enables the user, inter alia, to view content corresponding to a large extent to his or her interests, the fact remains that, subject to verification by the referring court, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer that user the services of the online social network. Those services may, where appropriate, be provided to the user in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services.\n\n103    As regards, second, the justification based on the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services, it is apparent from the file before the Court that there is no obligation to subscribe to the various services offered by the Meta group in order to create a user account in the social network Facebook. The various products and services offered by that group can be used independently of each other and the use of each product or service is based on the conclusion of a separate user agreement.\n\n104    Therefore, and subject to verification by the referring court, the processing of personal data from services offered by the Meta group, other than the online social network service, does not appear to be necessary for the latter service to be provided.\n\n105    As regards, in the second place, point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful only if it is ‘necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child’.\n\n106    As the Court has already held, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data covered by that provision is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party (judgment of 17 June 2021, _M.I.C.M._, C‑597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph 106 and the case-law cited).\n\n107    First, with regard to the condition relating to the pursuit of a legitimate interest, it must be stated that, according to Article 13(1)(d) of the GDPR, it is the responsibility of the controller, at the time when personal data relating to a data subject are collected from that person, to inform him or her of the legitimate interests pursued where that processing is based on point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation.\n\n108    Second, with regard to the condition that the processing of personal data be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, that condition requires the referring court to ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 June 2021, _Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)_, C‑439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph 110 and the case-law cited).\n\n109    In this context, it should also be recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the ‘data minimisation’ principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be ‘adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed’ (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 December 2019, _Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA_, C‑708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph 48).\n\n110    Third, with regard to the condition that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, the Court has already held that that condition entails a balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue which depends in principle on the specific circumstances of the particular case and that, consequently, it is for the referring court to carry out that balancing exercise, taking account of those specific circumstances (judgment of 17 June 2021, _M.I.C.M._, C‑597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph 111 and the case-law cited).\n\n111    In this respect, it is apparent from the very wording of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that it is necessary, in such a balancing exercise, to pay particular attention to the situation where the data subject is a child. According to recital 38 of that regulation, children merit specific protection with regard to the processing of their personal data because they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and of their rights related to such processing of personal data. Thus, such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the processing of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles or offering services aimed directly at children.\n\n112    Furthermore, as can be seen from recital 47 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect such processing.\n\n113    In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, the referring court mentions personalised advertising, network security, product improvement, the sharing of informing with law-enforcement agencies, the fact that the user is a minor, research and innovation for social good and the offer of services for commercial communication intended for the user and of analytics tools intended for advertisers and other business partners, enabling them to evaluate their performance.\n\n114    In that regard, it should be noted at the outset that the request for a preliminary ruling does not contain any explanation as to how research and innovation for social good or the fact that the user is a minor could justify, as legitimate interests within the meaning of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, the collection and use of the data in question. Consequently, the Court is not in a position to rule on this matter.\n\n115    First, with regard to personalised advertising, it must be borne in mind that, according to recital 47 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest of the controller.\n\n116    However, such processing must also be necessary in order to achieve that interest and the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject must not override that interest. In the context of that balancing of the opposing rights at issue, namely, those of the controller, on the one hand, and those of the data subject, on the other, account must be taken, as has been noted in paragraph 112 above, in particular of the reasonable expectations of the data subject as well as the scale of the processing at issue and its impact on that person.\n\n==117    In this regard, it is important to note that, despite the fact that the services of an online social network such as Facebook are free of charge, the user of that network cannot reasonably expect that the operator of the social network will process that user’s personal data, without his or her consent, for the purposes of personalised advertising. In those circumstances, it must be held that the interests and fundamental rights of such a user override the interest of that operator in such personalised advertising by which it finances its activity, with the result that the processing by that operator for such purposes cannot fall within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.==\n\n118    Furthermore, the processing at issue in the main proceedings is particularly extensive since it relates to potentially unlimited data and has a significant impact on the user, a large part – if not almost all – of whose online activities are monitored by Meta Platforms Ireland, which may give rise to the feeling that his or her private life is being continuously monitored.\n\n119    Second, as regards the objective of ensuring network security, that objective, as stated in recital 49 of the GDPR, constitutes a legitimate interest of Meta Platforms Ireland, capable of justifying the processing operation at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n120    However, as regards the need for that processing for the purposes of that legitimate interest, the referring court will have to ascertain whether and to what extent the processing of personal data collected from sources outside the social network Facebook is actually necessary to ensure that the internal security of that network is not compromised.\n\n121    In that context, as noted in paragraphs 108 and 109 above, it will also have to ascertain whether the legitimate data processing interest pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter and whether the ‘data minimisation’ principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR has been observed.\n\n122    Third, as regards the ‘product improvement’ objective, it cannot be ruled out from the outset that the controller’s interest in improving the product or service with a view to making it more efficient and thus more attractive can constitute a legitimate interest capable of justifying the processing of personal data and that such processing may be necessary in order to pursue that interest.\n\n123    However, subject to final assessment by the referring court in that respect, it appears doubtful whether, as regards the data processing at issue in the main proceedings, the ‘product improvement’ objective, given the scale of that processing and its significant impact on the user, as well as the fact that the user cannot reasonably expect those data to be processed by Meta Platforms Ireland, may override the interests and fundamental rights of such a user, particularly in the case where that user is a child.\n\n124    Fourth, as regards the objective referred to by the referring court, relating to the sharing of information with law-enforcement agencies in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, it must be held that that objective is not capable, in principle, of constituting a legitimate interest pursued by the controller, within the meaning of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. A private operator such as Meta Platforms Ireland cannot rely on such a legitimate interest, which is unrelated to its economic and commercial activity. Conversely, that objective may justify processing by such an operator where it is objectively necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which that operator is subject.\n\n125    In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to Questions 3 and 4 is that point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the processing is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for those users, such that the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if that processing does not occur.\n\n126    Point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the operator has informed the users from whom the data have been collected of a legitimate interest that is pursued by the data processing, that such processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest and that it is apparent from a balancing of the opposing interests, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of those users do not override that legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party.\n\n _Question 5_\n\n127    In the first place, in so far as that question refers to points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, it must be recalled that, under point (c), processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. In addition, under point (e), processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller is also lawful.\n\n128    Article 6(3) of the GDPR specifies, inter alia, in respect of those two situations in which processing is lawful, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that that legal basis must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n129    In the present case, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the processing of personal data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be regarded as justified in the light of point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, where it seeks to ‘respond to a legitimate request for certain data’, and, in the light of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation, where its purpose is to ‘research for social good’ and it seeks to ‘promote safety, integrity and security’.\n\n130    However, it should be noted that the referring court has not provided the Court of Justice with any material enabling it to give a specific ruling in this respect.\n\n131    It will therefore be for that court to ascertain, in the light of the conditions set out in paragraph 128 above, whether that processing can be regarded as being justified by the stated purposes.\n\n132    In particular, given the observations made in paragraph 124 above, it will be for the referring court, inter alia, to inquire, for the purposes of applying point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, whether Meta Platforms Ireland is under a legal obligation to collect and store personal data in a preventive manner in order to be able to respond to any request from a national authority seeking to obtain certain data relating to its users.\n\n133    Similarly, it will be for that court to assess, in the light of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, whether Meta Platforms Ireland was entrusted with a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, in particular with a view of carrying out research for the social good and to promote safety, integrity and security, bearing in mind that, given the type of activity and the essentially economic and commercial nature thereof, it seems unlikely that that private operator was entrusted with such a task.\n\n134    In addition, the referring court will, if necessary, have to determine whether, in view of the scale of the data processing by Meta Platforms Ireland and of its significant incidence on the users of the social network Facebook, that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary.\n\n135    As regards, in the second place, point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful where it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\n\n136    As can be seen from recital 46 of that regulation, that provision covers the specific situation in which the processing of personal data is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. In that regard, the recital cites by way of example, inter alia, humanitarian purposes, such as monitoring epidemics and their spread, as well as situations of humanitarian emergencies, such as situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n\n137    It follows from those examples and from the strict interpretation to be given to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that, in view of the nature of the services provided by the operator of an online social network, such an operator, whose activity is essentially economic and commercial in nature, cannot rely on the protection of an interest which is essential for the life of its users or of another person in order to justify, absolutely and in a purely abstract and preventive manner, the lawfulness of data processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n138    In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 5 is that point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, is justified, under that provision, where it is actually necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, pursuant to a provision of EU law or the law of the Member State concerned, where that legal basis meets an objective of public interest and is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and where that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary.\n\n139    Points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing of personal data cannot, in principle and subject to verification by the referring court, be regarded as necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e).\n\n _**Q****uestion** **6**_\n\n140    By Question 6, the referring court asks, in essence, whether point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that consent given by the user of an online social network to the operator of such a network may be regarded as satisfying the conditions of validity laid down in Article 4(11) of that regulation, in particular the condition that that consent must be freely given, where that operator holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks.\n\n141    Point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR require the data subject’s consent for the purposes of, respectively, processing his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes and processing special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1).\n\n142    Article 4(11) of the GDPR, for its part, defines ‘consent’ as meaning ‘any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her’.\n\n143    In the light of the referring court’s questions, it is important to recall, in the first place, that, according to recital 42 of the GDPR, consent cannot be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\n144    In the second place, recital 43 of that regulation states that, in order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller. That recital also clarifies that consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case.\n\n145    In the third place, Article 7(4) of the GDPR provides that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\n146    It is on the basis of those considerations that Question 6 must be answered.\n\n147    In that regard, it should be noted that, admittedly, the fact that the operator of an online social network, as controller, holds a dominant position on the social network market does not, as such, prevent the users of that social network from validly giving their consent, within the meaning of Article 4(11) of the GDPR, to the processing of their personal data by that operator.\n\n148    The fact remains that, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 75 of his Opinion, such a circumstance must be taken into consideration in assessing whether the user of that network has validly and, in particular, freely given consent, since that circumstance is liable to affect the freedom of choice of that user, who might be unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment, as stated in recital 42 of the GDPR.\n\n149    Furthermore, the existence of such a dominant position may create a clear imbalance, within the meaning of recital 43 of the GDPR, between the data subject and the controller, that imbalance favouring, inter alia, the imposition of conditions that are not strictly necessary for the performance of the contract, which must be taken into account under Article 7(4) of that regulation. In that context, it must be borne in mind that, as stated in paragraphs 102 to 104 above, it does not appear, subject to verification by the referring court, that the processing at issue in the main proceedings is strictly necessary for the performance of the contract between Meta Platforms Ireland and the users of the social network Facebook.\n\n150    Thus, those users must be free to refuse individually, in the context of the contractual process, to give their consent to particular data processing operations not necessary for the performance of the contract, without being obliged to refrain entirely from using the service offered by the online social network operator, which means that those users are to be offered, if necessary for an appropriate fee, an equivalent alternative not accompanied by such data processing operations.\n\n151    Moreover, given the scale of the processing of the data in question and the significant impact of that processing on the users of that network as well as the fact that those users cannot reasonably expect data other than those relating to their conduct within the social network to be processed by the operator of that network, it is appropriate, within the meaning of recital 43, to have the possibility of giving separate consent for the processing of the latter data, on the one hand, and the off-Facebook data, on the other. It is for the referring court to ascertain whether such a possibility exists, in the absence of which the consent of those users to the processing of the off-Facebook data must be presumed not to be freely given.\n\n152    Finally, it must be borne in mind that, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the GDPR, where processing is based on consent, it is the controller who bears the burden of demonstrating that the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data.\n\n153    It is in the light of those criteria and of a detailed examination of all the circumstances of the case that the referring court will have to determine whether the users of the social network Facebook have validly and, in particular, freely given their consent to the processing at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n154    In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 6 is that point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the operator of an online social network holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks does not, as such, preclude the users of such a network from being able validly to consent, within the meaning of Article 4(11) of that regulation, to the processing of their personal data by that operator. This is nevertheless an important factor in determining whether the consent was in fact validly and, in particular, freely given, which it is for that operator to prove.\n\n **Costs**\n\n155    Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n1.      **Article 51 et seq. of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), as well as Article 4(3) TEU**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that, subject to compliance with its duty of sincere cooperation with the supervisory authorities, a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, that that undertaking’s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with that regulation, where that finding is necessary to establish the existence of such an abuse.**\n\n**In view of this duty of sincere cooperation, the national competition authority cannot depart from a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the competent lead supervisory authority concerning those general terms or similar general terms. Where it has doubts as to the scope of such a decision, where those terms or similar terms are, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of an investigation or decision by those authorities, the competition authority takes the view that the terms in question are not consistent with Regulation 2016/679, it must consult and seek the cooperation of those supervisory authorities in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for them to take a decision before starting its own assessment. In the absence of any objection on their part or of any reply within a reasonable time, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation;**\n\n2.      **Article 9(1) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection – by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies – of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user’s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as ‘processing of special categories of personal data’ within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article 9(2), where that data processing allows information falling within one of those categories to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person;**\n\n3.      **Article 9(2)(e) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories set out in Article 9(1) of that regulation relate, the user does not manifestly make public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data relating to those visits collected by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies;**\n\n**Where he or she enters information into such websites or apps or where he or she clicks or taps on buttons integrated into those sites and apps, such as the ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using login credentials linked to his or her social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, that user manifestly makes public, within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e), the data thus entered or resulting from the clicking or tapping on those buttons only in the circumstance where he or she has explicitly made the choice beforehand, as the case may be on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, to make the data relating to him or her publicly accessible to an unlimited number of persons;**\n\n4.      **Point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the processing is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for those users, such that the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if that processing does not occur;**\n\n5.      **Point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the operator has informed the users from whom the data have been collected of a legitimate interest that is pursued by the data processing, that such processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest and that it is apparent from a balancing of the opposing interests, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of those users do not override that legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party;**\n\n6.      **Point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, is justified, under that provision, where it is actually necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, pursuant to a provision of EU law or the law of the Member State concerned, where that legal basis meets an objective of public interest and is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and where that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary;**\n\n7.      **Points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, cannot, in principle and subject to verification by the referring court, be regarded as necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e);**\n\n8.      **Point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of Regulation 2016/679**\n\n**must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the operator of an online social network holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks does not, as such, preclude the users of such a network from being able validly to consent, within the meaning of Article 4(11) of that regulation, to the processing of their personal data by that operator. This is nevertheless an important factor in determining whether the consent was in fact validly and, in particular, freely given, which it is for that operator to prove.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=req\u0026pageIndex=0\u0026docid=275125\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=1636759#Footref*)      Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.90378842Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/CJEU-Huber":{"title":"","content":"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber)\n\n16 December 2008 ([*](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=lst\u0026pageIndex=0\u0026docid=76077\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=418832#Footnote*))\n\n(Protection of personal data – European citizenship – Principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality – Directive 95/46/EC – Concept of necessity – General processing of personal data relating to citizens of the Union who are nationals of another Member State – Central register of foreign nationals)\n\nIn Case C‑524/06,\n\nREFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC from the Oberverwaltungsgericht für das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (Germany), made by decision of 15 December 2006, received at the Court on 28 December 2006, in the proceedings\n\n**Heinz Huber**\n\nv\n\n**Bundesrepublik Deutschland,**\n\nTHE COURT (Grand Chamber),\n\ncomposed of V.

…’.\n\n4        The tenth recital in the preamble to that directive adds:\n\n‘… the approximation of [the national laws on the processing of personal data] must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community’. \n\n5        Article 1 of Directive 95/46 is entitled ‘Object of the Directive’ and Article 1(1) provides:\n\n‘In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.’\n\n6        Article 2 of that directive includes the following definitions:\n\n‘…\n\n(a)      “personal data” shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;\n\n(b)      “processing of personal data” (“processing”) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;\n\n…’.\n\n7        The scope of application of Directive 95/46 is laid down by Article 3, in the following terms:\n\n‘1.      This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n\n2.      This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data:\n\n–        in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law,\n\n–        by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.’\n\n8        Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 states:\n\n‘Member States shall provide that personal data may be processed only if:\n\n…\n\n(e)       processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed; \n\n…’.\n\n9        Article 4 of Council Directive 68/360/EEC of 15 October 1968 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families (OJ, English Special Edition 1968 (II), p. 485) provides:\n\n‘1.      Member States shall grant the right of residence in their territory to the persons referred to in Article 1 who are able to produce the documents listed in paragraph 3.\n\n2.      As proof of the right of residence, a document entitled “Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC” shall be issued. … \n\n3.      For the issue of a Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC, Member States may require only the production of the following documents:\n\n–         by the worker: \n\n(a)      the document with which he entered their territory;\n\n(b)      a confirmation of engagement from the employer or a certificate of employment;\n\n–        by the members of the worker’s family: \n\n(c)      the document with which they entered the territory;\n\n(d)      a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, proving their relationship;\n\n(e)      in the cases referred to in Article 10(1) and (2) of [Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (OJ, English Special Edition 1968 (II), p. 475)], a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, testifying that they are dependent on the worker or that they live under his roof in such country.\n\n…’\n\n10      Article 10 of Directive 68/360 provides:\n\n‘Member States shall not derogate from the provisions of this Directive save on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.’\n\n11      Article 4(1) of Council Directive 73/148/EEC of 21 May 1973 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to establishment and the provision of services (OJ 1973 L 172, p. 14) states:\n\n‘Each Member State shall grant the right of permanent residence to nationals of other Member States who establish themselves within its territory in order to pursue activities as self-employed persons, when the restrictions on these activities have been abolished pursuant to the Treaty.\n\nAs proof of the right of residence, a document entitled “Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the European Communities” shall be issued. This document shall be valid for not less than five years from the date of issue and shall be automatically renewable.\n\n…’\n\n12      Article 6 of Directive 73/148 states:\n\n‘An applicant for a residence permit or right of abode shall not be required by a Member State to produce anything other than the following, namely:\n\n(a)      the identity card or passport with which he or she entered its territory;\n\n(b)      proof that he or she comes within one of the classes of person referred to in Articles 1 and 4.’\n\n13      Article 8 of that directive sets out the derogation provided for in Article 10 of Directive 68/360. \n\n14      On 29 April 2004, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC (OJ 2004 L 158, p. 77, with Corrigendum, OJ 2004 L 229, p. 35), which required to be transposed by 30 April 2006. Article 5 of that directive provides: \n\n‘1.      Without prejudice to the provisions on travel documents applicable to national border controls, Member States shall grant Union citizens leave to enter their territory with a valid identity card or passport and shall grant family members who are not nationals of a Member State leave to enter their territory with a valid passport. ^1\n\n…\n\n5.      The Member State may require the person concerned to report his/her presence within its territory within a reasonable and non-discriminatory period of time. Failure to comply with this requirement may make the person concerned liable to proportionate and non-discriminatory sanctions.’\n\n15      Article 7(1) of that directive governs the right of residence for a period of more than three months of Union citizens in a Member State of which they are not nationals in the following terms:\n\n‘All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State for a period of longer than three months if they:\n\n(a)      are workers or self-employed persons in the host Member State; or \n\n(b)      have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period of residence and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State; or \n\n(c)      –       are enrolled at a private or public establishment, accredited or financed by the host Member State on the basis of its legislation or administrative practice, for the principal purpose of following a course of study, including vocational training; and\n\n         –       have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State and assure the relevant national authority, by means of a declaration or by such equivalent means as they may choose, that they have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period of residence; or\n\n…’.\n\n16      Article 8 of Directive 2004/38 provides: \n\n‘1.      Without prejudice to Article 5(5), for periods of residence longer than three months, the host Member State may require Union citizens to register with the relevant authorities.\n\n2.      The deadline for registration may not be less than three months from the date of arrival. A registration certificate shall be issued immediately, stating the name and address of the person registering and the date of the registration. Failure to comply with the registration requirement may render the person concerned liable to proportionate and non-discriminatory sanctions.\n\n3.      For the registration certificate to be issued, Member States may only require that:\n\n–        Union citizens to whom point (a) of Article 7(1) applies present a valid identity card or passport, a confirmation of engagement from the employer or a certificate of employment, or proof that they are self-employed persons;\n\n–        Union citizens to whom point (b) of Article 7(1) applies present a valid identity card or passport and provide proof that they satisfy the conditions laid down therein;\n\n–        Union citizens to whom point (c) of Article 7(1) applies present a valid identity card or passport, provide proof of enrolment at an accredited establishment and of comprehensive sickness insurance cover and the declaration or equivalent means referred to in point (c) of Article 7(1). …’\n\n17      Article 27 of that directive, entitled ‘General principles’, states: \n\n‘1.      Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of nationality, on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. These grounds shall not be invoked to serve economic ends.\n\n2.      Measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned. Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures.\n\nThe personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted.\n\n3.      In order to ascertain whether the person concerned represents a danger for public policy or public security, when issuing the registration certificate or, in the absence of a registration system, not later than three months from the date of arrival of the person concerned on its territory or from the date of reporting his/her presence within the territory, as provided for in Article 5(5), or when issuing the residence card, the host Member State may, should it consider this essential, request the Member State of origin and, if need be, other Member States to provide information concerning any previous police record the person concerned may have. Such enquiries shall not be made as a matter of routine. …\n\n…’\n\n18      Lastly, Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on Community statistics on migration and international protection and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 311/76 on the compilation of statistics on foreign workers (OJ 2007 L 199, p. 23) lays down the framework in which the Member States are to supply statistics to the Commission of the European Communities relating to migratory flows in their territories. \n\n _National legislation_\n\n19      In accordance with Paragraph 1(1) of the Law on the central register of foreign nationals (Gesetz über das Ausländerzentralregister) of 2 September 1994 (BGBl. 1994 I, p. 2265), as amended by the Law of 21 June 2005 (BGBl. 1994 I, p. 1818) (‘the AZRG’), the Bundesamt, which is attached to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, is responsible for the management of the AZR, a centralised register which contains certain personal data relating to foreign nationals who, inter alia, are resident in Germany on a basis which is not purely temporary. The foreign nationals concerned are those who reside in that territory for a period of more than three months, as is shown by the general administrative circular of the Federal Ministry of the Interior relating to the AZRG and to the regulation implementing that Law (Allgemeine Verwaltungsvorschrift des Bundesministeriums des Innern zum Gesetz über das AZR und zur AZRG-Durchführungsverordnung) of 4 June 1996. That information is collected in two databases which are managed separately. One contains personal data relating to foreign nationals who live or have lived in Germany and the other to those who have applied for a visa.\n\n20      In accordance with Paragraph 3 of the AZRG, the first database contains, in particular, the following information: \n\n–        the name of the authority which provided the data;\n\n–        the reference number allocated by the Bundesamt;\n\n–        the grounds of registration; \n\n–        surname, surname at birth, given names, date and place of birth, sex and nationality; \n\n–        previous and other patronymics, marital status, particulars of identity documents, the last place of residence in the country of origin, and information supplied on a voluntary basis as to religion and the nationality of the spouse or partner; \n\n–        particulars of entries into and exits from the territory, residence status, decisions of the Federal Employment Agency relating to a work permit, refugee status granted by another State, date of death;\n\n–        decisions relating, inter alia, to any application for asylum, any previous application for a residence permit, and particulars of, inter alia, any expulsion proceedings, arrest warrants, suspected contraventions of the laws on drugs or immigration, and suspected participation in terrorist activities, or convictions in respect of such activities; and\n\n–        search warrants.\n\n21      As the authority entrusted with the management of the AZR, the Bundesamt is responsible for the accuracy of the data registered in it.\n\n22      According to Paragraph 1(2) of the AZRG, by registering and supplying personal data relating to foreign nationals, the Bundesamt assists the public authorities responsible for the application of the law on foreign nationals and the law on asylum, together with other public bodies. \n\n23      Paragraph 10(1) of the AZRG provides that every application made by a public authority to consult the AZR or for the making available of personal data contained in it must satisfy certain conditions, compliance with which must be determined by the Bundesamt on a case-by-case basis. The Bundesamt must, in particular, examine whether the data requested by an authority are necessary for the performance of its tasks and must also examine the precise use to which those data are intended to be put. The Bundesamt may reject an application if it does not satisfy the prescribed conditions.\n\n24      Paragraphs 14 to 21 and 25 to 27 of the Law specify the personal data which may be made available depending on the body which made the application in respect of them.\n\n25      Thus, Paragraph 14(1) of the AZRG authorises the communication to all German public authorities of data relating to identity and domicile, as well as the date of death and particulars of the authority responsible for the file and of any decision not to make data available.\n\n26      Paragraph 12 of the AZRG provides that applications, termed ‘group applications’, that is to say, which relate to a group of persons having one or more common characteristics, are to be subject to certain substantive and formal conditions. Such applications may be made only by a limited number of public bodies. In addition, every communication of personal data pursuant to such an application must be notified to the Federal and regional regulators responsible for the protection of personal data.\n\n27      In addition, Paragraph 22 of the AZRG permits public bodies authorised for that purpose to consult the AZR directly through an automated procedure. However, the right to do so arises only in strictly defined circumstances and after a weighing up by the Bundesamt of the interests of the data subject and the public interest. Moreover, such consultation is allowed only in the case of so-called group applications. The public bodies having rights under Paragraph 22 of the AZRG are, by virtue of Paragraph 7 of that Law, also authorised to enter data and information directly in the AZR.\n\n28      Lastly, Paragraphs 25 to 27 of the AZRG specify the public bodies which may obtain certain data contained in the AZR.\n\n29      The national court adds that, in Germany, every inhabitant, whether a German national or not, must have his particulars entered in the register kept by the authorities of the district in which he resides (Einwohnermelderegister). The Commission has stated in that regard that that type of register contains only some of the data comprised in the AZR, with those relating, in particular, to a person’s status as regards his right of residence not appearing there. There are currently some 7 700 district registers. ^9\n\n **The facts and the questions referred** \n\n30      Mr Huber, an Austrian national, moved to Germany in 1996 in order to carry on business there as a self-employed insurance agent. \n\n31      The following data relating to him are stored in the AZR:\n\n–        his name, given name, date and place of birth, nationality, marital status, sex;\n\n–        a record of his entries into and exits from Germany, and his residence status;\n\n–        particulars of passports issued to him;\n\n–        a record of his previous statements as to domicile; and\n\n–        reference numbers issued by the Bundesamt, particulars of the authorities which supplied the data and the reference numbers used by those authorities.\n\n32      Since he took the view that he was discriminated against by reason of the processing of the data concerning him contained in the AZR, in particular because such a database does not exist in respect of German nationals, Mr Huber requested the deletion of those data on 22 July 2000. That request was rejected on 29 September 2000 by the administrative authority which was responsible for maintaining the AZR at the time.\n\n33      The challenge to that decision also having been unsuccessful, Mr Huber brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht Köln (Administrative Court, Cologne) which upheld the action by judgment of 19 December 2002. The Verwaltungsgericht Köln held that the general processing, through the AZR, of data regarding a Union citizen who is not a German national constitutes a restriction of Articles 49 EC and 50 EC which cannot be justified by the objective of the swift treatment of cases relating to the right of residence of foreign nationals. In addition, that court took the view that the storage and processing of the data at issue were contrary to Articles 12 EC and 18 EC, as well as Articles 6(1)(b) and 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n\n34      The Bundesrepublik Deutschland, acting through the Bundesamt, brought an appeal against that judgment before the Oberverwaltungsgericht für das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (Higher Administrative Court for the _Land_ North-Rhine Westphalia), which considers that certain of the questions of law raised before it require an interpretation of Community law by the Court.\n\n35      First, the national court notes that, according to the Court’s case-law, a citizen of the European Union lawfully resident in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope of Community law. It refers in that regard to Case C‑85/96 _Martínez Sala_ [1998] ECR I‑2691, paragraph 63; Case C-184/99 _Grzelczyk_ [2001] ECR I-6193, paragraph 32; and Case C-209/03 _Bidar_ [2005] ECR I-2119, paragraph 32. Accordingly, having exercised the right to the freedom of movement conferred on him by Article 18(1) EC, Mr Huber was entitled to rely on the prohibition of discrimination laid down by Article 12 EC.\n\n36      The national court states that the general processing of personal data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR differs from the processing of data relating to a German national in two respects: first, some of the data relating to Mr Huber are stored not only in the register of the district in which he resides but also in the AZR, and, secondly, the AZR contains additional data. \n\n37      The national court doubts whether such a difference in treatment can be justified by the need to monitor the residence of foreign nationals in Germany. It also raises the question whether the general processing of personal data relating to Union citizens who are not German nationals and who reside or have resided in Germany is proportionate to the objective of protecting public security, inasmuch as the AZR covers all of those citizens and not only those who are subject to an expulsion order or a prohibition on residing in Germany.\n\n38      Secondly, the national court is of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the main proceedings, Mr Huber falls within the scope of application of Article 43 EC. Since the freedom of establishment extends not only to the taking up of activities as a self-employed person but also the framework conditions for that activity, the national court raises the question whether the general processing of data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR is liable to affect those conditions to such an extent that it comprises a restriction on the exercise of that freedom.\n\n39      Thirdly, the national court raises the question whether the criterion of necessity imposed by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 can be a criterion for assessing a system of general data processing such as the system put in place under the AZR. The national court does not, in fact, rule out the possibility that the directive may leave it open to the national legislature itself to define that requirement of necessity. However, should that not be the case, the question arises how that requirement is to be understood, and more particularly whether the objective of administrative simplification might justify data processing of the kind put in place by the AZRG.\n\n40      In those circumstances, the Oberverwaltungsgericht für das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘(1)      Is the general processing of personal data of foreign citizens of the Union in a central register of foreign nationals compatible with … the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality against citizens of the Union who exercise their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (Article 12(1) EC, in conjunction with Articles 17 EC and 18(1) EC)[?]\n\n(2)      [Is such processing compatible with] the prohibition of restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State (first paragraph of Article 43 EC)[?]\n\n(3)       [Is such treatment compatible with] the requirement of necessity under Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 …?’\n\n **The questions referred**\n\n _Preliminary observations_\n\n41      By its questions, the national court asks the Court whether the processing of personal data which is undertaken in a register such as the AZR is compatible with Community law. \n\n42      In that regard, it must be noted that Paragraph 1(2) of the AZRG provides that, through the storage of certain personal data relating to foreign nationals in the AZR and the making available of those data, the Bundesamt, which is responsible for maintaining that register, assists the public authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the law on foreign nationals and the law on asylum, together with other public bodies. In particular, the German Government has stated in its written observations that the AZR is used for statistical purposes and on the exercise by the security and police services and by the judicial authorities of their powers in relation to the prosecution and investigation of activities which are criminal or threaten public security. \n\n43      At the outset, it must be stated that data such as those which, according to the order for reference, the AZR contains in relation to Mr Huber constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46, because they represent ‘information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person’. Their collection, storage and transmission by the body responsible for the management of the register in which they are kept thus represents the ‘processing of personal data’ within the meaning of Article 2(b) of that directive.\n\n44      However, Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 expressly excludes from its scope of application, inter alia, the processing of personal data concerning public security, defence, State security and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.\n\n45      It follows that, while the processing of personal data for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes falls within the scope of application of Directive 95/46, the position is otherwise where the objective of processing those data is connected with the fight against crime.\n\n46      Consequently, the compatibility with Community law of the processing of personal data undertaken through a register such as the AZR should be examined, first, in the context of its function of providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and to its use for statistical purposes, by having regard to Directive 95/46 and more particularly, in view of the third question, to the condition of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of that directive, as interpreted in the light of the requirements of the Treaty including in particular the prohibition of any discrimination on grounds of nationality under Article 12(1) EC, and, secondly, in the context of its function in the fight against crime, by having regard to primary Community law.\n\n _The processing of personal data for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes_ \n\n The concept of necessity \n\n47      Article 1 of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their privacy, in relation to the handling of personal data.\n\n48      Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled ‘General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data’, provides that, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article 13, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article 6 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article 7 (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 _Österreichischer Rundfunk and Others_ [2003] ECR I‑4989, paragraph 65).\n\n49      In particular, Article 7(e) provides that personal data may lawfully be processed if ‘it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed’.\n\n50      In that context, it must be noted that Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from the eighth recital in the preamble thereto, to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is equivalent in all Member States. The tenth recital adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community.\n\n51      Thus, it has been held that the harmonisation of those national laws is not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation which is generally complete (see Case C-101/01 _Lindqvist_ [2003] ECR I‑12971, paragraph 96).\n\n52      Consequently, having regard to the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States, the concept of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, the purpose of which is to delimit precisely one of the situations in which the processing of personal data is lawful, cannot have a meaning which varies between the Member States. It therefore follows that what is at issue is a concept which has its own independent meaning in Community law and which must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that directive, as laid down in Article 1(1) thereof. ^86257c\n\n The necessity for the processing of personal data, such as the processing undertaken through the AZR, for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes \n\n53      It is apparent from the order for reference that the AZR is a centralised register which contains certain personal data relating to Union citizens who are not German nationals and that it may be consulted by a number of public and private bodies. \n\n54      As regards the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, it is important to bear in mind that, as Community law presently stands, the right of free movement of a Union citizen in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national is not unconditional but may be subject to the limitations and conditions imposed by the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect (see, to that effect, Case C‑33/07 _Jippa_ [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).\n\n55      Thus, Article 4 of Directive 68/360, read in conjunction with Article 1 thereof, and Article 6 of Directive 73/148, read in conjunction with Article 1 thereof, provided that, in order for a national of a Member State to be entitled to reside for a period of more than three months in the territory of another Member State, that person had to belong to one of the categories laid down by those directives and provided for that entitlement to be subject to certain formalities linked to the presentation or the provision by the applicant of a residence permit together with various documents and particulars.\n\n56      In addition, Article 10 of Directive 68/360 and Article 8 of Directive 73/148 permitted Member States to derogate from the provisions of those directives on grounds of public policy, public security or public health and to limit the right of entry and residence of a national of another Member State in their territory.\n\n57      While Directive 2004/38, which fell to be transposed by 30 April 2006 and which accordingly did not apply at the time of the facts of the present case, repealed both of the abovementioned directives, it sets out, in Article 7, conditions which are generally equivalent to those laid down under its predecessors as regards the right of residence of nationals of other Member States and, in Article 27(1), restrictions relating to that right which are essentially identical to those laid down under its predecessors. It also provides, in Article 8(1), that the host Member State may require every Union citizen who is a national of another Member State and who wishes to reside in its territory for a period of more than three months to register with the relevant authorities. In that regard, the host Member State may, by virtue of Article 8(3), require certain documents and particulars to be provided in order to enable those authorities to determine that the conditions for entitlement to a right of residence are satisfied.\n\n58      It must therefore be held that it is necessary for a Member State to have the relevant particulars and documents available to it in order to ascertain, within the framework laid down under the applicable Community legislation, whether a right of residence in its territory exists in relation to a national of another Member State and to establish that there are no grounds which would justify a restriction on that right. It follows that the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence is, in principle, legitimate and, having regard to its nature, compatible with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality laid down by Article 12(1) EC.\n\n59      However, such a register must not contain any information other than what is necessary for that purpose. In that regard, as Community law presently stands, the processing of personal data contained in the documents referred to in Articles 8(3) and 27(1) of Directive 2004/38 must be considered to be necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence.\n\n60      Moreover, while the collection of the data required for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence would be of no practical benefit if those data were not to be stored, it must be emphasised that, since a change in the personal situation of a party entitled to a right of residence may have an impact on his status in relation to that right, it is incumbent on the authority responsible for a register such as the AZR to ensure that the data which are stored are, where appropriate, brought up to date so that, first, they reflect the actual situation of the data subjects and, secondly, irrelevant data are removed from that register.\n\n61      As regards the detailed rules for the use of such a register for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, only the grant of access to authorities having powers in that field could be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n\n62      Lastly, with respect to the necessity that a centralised register such as the AZR be available in order to meet the requirements of the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, even if it were to be assumed that decentralised registers such as the district population registers contain all the data which are relevant for the purposes of allowing the authorities to undertake their duties, the centralisation of those data could be necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, if it contributes to the more effective application of that legislation as regards the right of residence of Union citizens who wish to reside in a Member State of which they are not nationals. \n\n63      As regards the statistical function of a register such as the AZR, it must be recalled that, by creating the principle of freedom of movement for persons and by conferring on any person falling within its ambit the right of access to the territory of the Member States for the purposes intended by the Treaty, Community law has not excluded the power of Member States to adopt measures enabling the national authorities to have an exact knowledge of population movements affecting their territory (see Case 118/75 _Watson and Belmann_ [1976] ECR 1185, paragraph 17).\n\n64      Similarly, Regulation No 862/2007, which provides for the transmission of statistics relating to migratory flows in the territory of the Member States, presupposes that information will be collected by those States which allows those statistics to be determined.\n\n65      However, the exercise of that power does not, of itself, mean that the collection and storage of individualised personal information in a register such as the AZR is necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46. As the Advocate General stated at point 23 of his Opinion, it is only anonymous information that requires to be processed in order for such an objective to be attained.\n\n66      It follows from all of the above that a system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, such as that put in place by the AZRG and having as its object the provision of support to the national authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, does not satisfy the requirement of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, interpreted in the light of the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality, unless:\n\n–        it contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities of that legislation, and\n\n–        its centralised nature enables that legislation to be more effectively applied as regards the right of residence of Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.\n\n67      It is for the national court to ascertain whether those conditions are satisfied in the main proceedings.\n\n68      The storage and processing of personal data containing individualised personal information in a register such as the AZR for statistical purposes cannot, on any basis, be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n\n _The processing of personal data relating to Union citizens who are nationals of other Member States for the purposes of fighting crime_ \n\n69      As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, citizenship of the Union is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States, enabling those who find themselves in the same situation to receive the same treatment in law irrespective of their nationality, subject to such exceptions as are expressly provided for (see, to that effect, _Grzelczyk_, paragraphs 30 and 31; Case C‑148/02 _Garcia Avello_ [2003] ECR I‑11613, paragraphs 22 and 23; and _Bidar_, paragraph 31).\n\n70      In that regard, a Union citizen lawfully resident in the territory of the host Member State can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope ratione materiae of Community law (see _Martínez Sala_, paragraph 63; _Grzelczyk_, paragraph 32; and _Bidar_, paragraph 32).\n\n71      Those situations include those involving the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty and those involving the exercise of the right to move and reside within the territory of the Member States, as conferred by Article 18 EC (see, to that effect, _Bidar_, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited).\n\n72      It is apparent from Paragraph 1 of the AZRG, read in conjunction with the general administrative circular of the Federal Ministry of the Interior of 4 June 1996 relating to the AZRG and to the regulation implementing that Law, that the system of storage and processing of personal data put in place through the AZR concerns all Union citizens who are not nationals of the Federal Republic of Germany and who reside in Germany for a period of over three months, irrespective of the reasons which lead them to reside there.\n\n73      That being the case, since Mr Huber exercised his freedom to move and reside within that territory as conferred by Article 18 EC, reference should, having regard to the circumstances of the main proceedings, be made to Article 12(1) EC in order to determine whether a system for the storage and processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings is compatible with the principle that any discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited, in so far as those data are stored and processed for the purposes of fighting crime.\n\n74      In that context, it should be pointed out that the order for reference does not contain any detailed information which would allow it to be established whether the situation at issue in the main proceedings is covered by Article 43 EC. However, even if the national court were to consider that to be the case, the application of the principle of non-discrimination cannot vary depending on whether it finds its basis in that provision or on Article 12(1) EC, read in conjunction with Article 18(1) EC. \n\n75      It is settled case-law that the principle of non-discrimination, which has its basis in Articles 12 EC and 43 EC, requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and that different situations must not be treated in the same way. Such treatment may be justified only if it is based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and is proportionate to the objective being legitimately pursued (see, to that effect, Case C-164/07 _Wood_ [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 13 and the case-law cited).\n\n76      It is therefore, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, necessary to compare the situation of Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned and who are resident in the territory of that Member State with that of nationals of that Member State as regards the objective of fighting crime. In fact, the German Government relies only on that aspect of the protection of public order.\n\n77      Although that objective is a legitimate one, it cannot be relied on in order to justify the systematic processing of personal data when that processing is restricted to the data of Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned.\n\n78      As the Advocate General noted at point 21 of his Opinion, the fight against crime, in the general sense in which that term is used by the German Government in its observations, necessarily involves the prosecution of crimes and offences committed, irrespective of the nationality of their perpetrators.\n\n79      It follows that, as regards a Member State, the situation of its nationals cannot, as regards the objective of fighting crime, be different from that of Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State and who are resident in its territory.\n\n80      Therefore, the difference in treatment between those nationals and those Union citizens which arises by virtue of the systematic processing of personal data relating only to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned for the purposes of fighting crime constitutes discrimination which is prohibited by Article 12(1) EC.\n\n81      Consequently, Article 12(1) EC must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the putting in place by a Member State, for the purpose of fighting crime, of a system for processing personal data specific to Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.\n\n **Costs**\n\n82      Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n1.      **A system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, such as that put in place by the Law on the central register of foreign nationals (Gesetz über das Ausländerzentralregister) of 2 September 1994, as amended by the Law of 21 June 2005, and having as its object the provision of support to the national authorities responsible for the application of the law relating to the right of residence does not satisfy the requirement of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, interpreted in the light of the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality, unless:**\n\n–        **it contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities of that legislation, and** \n\n–        **its centralised nature enables the legislation relating to the right of residence to be more effectively applied as regards Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.**\n\n**It is for the national court to ascertain whether those conditions are satisfied in the main proceedings.**\n\n**The storage and processing of personal data containing individualised personal information in a register such as the Central Register of Foreign Nationals for statistical purposes cannot, on any basis, be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.**\n\n2.      **Article 12(1) EC must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the putting in place by a Member State, for the purpose of fighting crime, of a system for processing personal data specific to Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.** \n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=lst\u0026pageIndex=0\u0026docid=76077\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=418832#Footref*) Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.90378842Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/CJEU-Question-3":{"title":"","content":"\n97      As regards, in the first place, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract’.\n\n98      In that regard, in order for the processing of personal data to be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract, within the meaning of that provision, it must be objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for the data subject. The controller must therefore be able to demonstrate how the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if the processing in question does not occur.\n\n99      The fact that such processing may be referred to in the contract or may be merely useful for the performance of the contract is, in itself, irrelevant in that regard. The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be essential for the proper performance of the contract concluded **between the controller and the data subject** and, therefore, that there are no workable, less intrusive alternatives.\n\n100    In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point 54 of his Opinion, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those **services** separately.\n\n101    In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of that provision, the referring court mentions, as elements intended to ensure the proper performance of the contract concluded between Meta Platforms Ireland and its users, personalised content and the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services.\n\n102    As regards, first, the justification based on personalised content, it is important to note that, although such a personalisation is useful to the user, in so far as it enables the user, inter alia, to view content corresponding to a large extent to his or her interests, the fact remains that, subject to verification by the referring court, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer that user the services of the online social network. Those services may, where appropriate, be provided to the user in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services.\n\n103    As regards, second, the justification based on the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services, it is apparent from the file before the Court that there i**s no obligation to subscribe to** the **various** services offered by the Meta group in order to create a user account in the social network Facebook. ==The various products and services offered by that **group can be used independently** of each other and the use of each product or service is based on the conclusion of a separate user agreement.==!!! \n\n104    Therefore, and subject to verification by the referring court, the processing of personal data from services offered by the Meta group, other than the online social network service, does not appear to be necessary for the latter service to be provided.\n\n4.      Point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, ==which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network **from other services of the group** to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data,== can be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the processing is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for those users, such that the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if that processing does not occur.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.90378842Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/Contract-under-Brussels-I":{"title":"","content":"Concerning, in the first place, the interpretation of the concept of ‘matters relating to a contract’ within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation No 44/2001, it is important to note that that concept must be interpreted independently, regard being had to the general scheme and objectives of the regulation, in order to ensure that it is applied uniformly in all the Member States. That concept cannot therefore be taken to refer to classification under the relevant national law of the legal relationship in question before the national court (see by analogy, inter alia, Case C‑26/91 _Handte_ [1992] ECR I‑3967, paragraph 10, and Case C‑265/02 _Frahuil_[2004] ECR I‑1543, paragraph 22).

(“the **Complainant**”).  While Facebook Ireland Limited has since changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, with effect from 5 January 2022, the relevant events, for the purpose of the Inquiry, occurred prior to this name change.  In the circumstances, the term “Facebook” is used throughout this Decision to denote Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, the company formerly known as Facebook Ireland Limited.  Similarly, Facebook, Inc. changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. on 28 October 2021 and any references, within this Decision, to “Facebook, Inc.” should be understood as meaning Meta Platforms, Inc., the company formerly known as Facebook, Inc. \n\n1.3 The complaint was referred to the Commission by the Austrian Data Protection Authority, _Die_ _Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde_ (“the **Austrian DPA**“) on 30 May 2018 (“the **Complaint**“). In advance of the preparation of this Decision, a preliminary draft of this document (“the **Preliminary Draft Decision**”) was circulated to Facebook and the Complainant’s representative so as to enable them to make submissions on my provisional findings. The submissions of these parties have been taken into account in finalising this Decision. \n\n1.4 This Decision further reflects the binding decision that was made by the European Data Protection Board (the “**Board**” or, otherwise, the “**EDPB**”) pursuant to Article 65(2) of the GDPR[[1]](#_ftn1) (the “**Article 65 Decision**”), which directed changes to certain of the positions reflected in the draft decision that was presented by the Commission for the purposes of Article 60 of the GDPR (the “**Draft Decision**”), as detailed further below.  The Article 65 Decision will be published on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 65(5) of the GDPR, and a copy of same is attached at Schedule 2 to this Decision.\n\n1.5 Further details of procedural matters and a chronology pertaining to the Inquiry are set out in Schedule 1 to this Decision.  \n\n**2.** **F****ACTUAL B****ACKGROUND AND THE C****OMPLAINT**\n\n## FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n2.1 Facebook is an online social network and social media platform.  In order to access the Facebook platform, a prospective user must create a Facebook account.  To create a Facebook account, a prospective user is required to accept a series of terms and conditions, referred to by Facebook as their Terms of Service (the “**Terms of Service**”).  When a prospective user accepts the Terms of Service, the terms contained therein constitute a contract between the (new) user and Facebook.  It is only on acceptance of the Terms of Service that the individual becomes a registered Facebook user.\n\n2.2 In April 2018, Facebook updated the Terms of Service to give effect to changes it sought to implement to comply with the obligations which would arise when the GDPR became applicable from 25 May 2018. Among the obligations under the GDPR, as under Directive 95/46/EC, was the fundamental requirement that data controllers have a lawful basis for any processing of personal data they undertake.  Legal bases provided for in the GDPR include consent of the data subject, necessity for the purposes of the performance of a contract with the data subject or processing necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the data controller. In addition, under the GDPR, controllers are required to provide detailed information to users at the time personal data is obtained in relation to the purposes of any data processing and the legal basis for any such processing. In essence, there must be a legal basis for each processing operation (of personal data) and there must be transparency in the communication of such information to individual users. Prior to the GDPR taking legal effect, no detailed requirement existed for a controller to explicitly state what legal basis they relied on in processing particular categories of personal data. \n\n2.3 To continue to access the Facebook platform, all users were required to accept the updated Terms of Service prior to 25 May 2018. The updated Terms of Service were brought to the attention of existing Facebook users by way of a series of information notices and options on the Facebook platform, referred to as an “engagement flow” or “user flow”.  The engagement flow was designed to guide users through the processing of deciding whether to accept the updated Terms of Service. The option to accept the updated “terms” was presented to users at the final stage of the engagement flow. The final stage of the engagement flow also contained embedded hyperlinks to the full text of the Terms of Service, the Data Policy and the Cookies Policy. As referenced in the full text of the Terms of Service, the Data Policy provides information to users on Facebook’s processing of personal data in respect of the Facebook platform.\n\n2.4 Existing users who were not willing to accept the new terms were advised of the option to delete their Facebook account.  Such users were informed that they could no longer use the Facebook platform without accepting the new terms.  Prior to deletion of the account, the users were also informed of the option to download a copy of their personal data which had undergone processing by Facebook. \n\n2.5 Users who did continue through the new “engagement flow” were given the opportunity to consent or not to consent to a number of specific data processing activities, including the use of facial recognition. Provision of consent for such processing was not presented as a prerequisite for continuing to use the service. In other words, these were choices the user could make above and beyond the decision to sign up to the service, and users are free to use the service without providing consent to this processing.\n\n2.6 Figures 2.1 and 2.2, below, are screenshots of the final stage of the “engagement flow” which brought an existing user, the Complainant, through the process of accepting the updated Terms of Service.  The screenshots are in German; an English translation can be found below.  \n\n![](file:///C:/Users/milos/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg) \n\n**Figure 2.1**\n\n![](file:///C:/Users/milos/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg) \n\n **Figure: 2.2**\n\n2.7 An English translation (via machine-translation) of the text is as follows:\n\n**Figure 2.1:** “_Please accept our updated Terms of Service to continue using Facebook. We have updated our Terms of Service to explain in more detail how our service works and what we expect from all Facebook uses.

These now also take into account new features that we are working on and explaining. By clicking \"I agree\", you accept the updated Terms of Service.

This claim is disputed by Facebook.[[3]](#_ftn3) The Complainant further alleges that Facebook relied on “forced consent” to process personal data on the basis that “_the controller required the data subject to agree to the entire privacy policy and the new terms_”4 and did not give users a genuine choice to decline the updated terms without suffering detriment.  \n\n2.10 In addition, the Complainant alleges that it is unclear which specific legal basis is being relied on by the controller for each processing operation.  Indeed, she argues that “[i]_t remains, nevertheless, unclear which exact processing operations the controller chooses to base on each specific legal basis_”[[4]](#_ftn4) as “[t]_he controller simply lists all six bases for lawful processing under Article 6 of the GDPR in its privacy policy without stating exactly which legal basis the controller relies upon for each specific processing operation._”[[5]](#_ftn5)  In connection with this, the Complainant expresses particular concern with reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing operations detailed in the Terms of Services; extracts from the Terms of Service which relate to these processing operations  are found below. \n\n2.11 As the GDPR requires controllers to provide detailed information to users at the time when personal data are obtained, including the provision of information about the purposes of the processing as well as the legal bases for the processing, the Complainant argues that this lack of information breaches the transparency obligations in the GDPR.[[6]](#_ftn6)\n\n2.12 In the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision made on the Complainant’s behalf, it is argued that the Commission has “_failed to investigate the relevant facts_”.[[7]](#_ftn7) As far as it has been possible to discern from the submissions, it appears that this assertion is linked to the Complainant’s contention that the Commission has misconstrued the scope of the Complaint and/or failed to carry out particular acts or investigative steps that the Complainant has demanded of the Commission. I address this submission in the consideration of the scope of the Complaint below and in Schedule 1 to this Decision. In reality, the essential facts relevant to this Complaint are simple and not in dispute; it is the legal assessment of these facts under the GDPR that requires determination in this Complaint.\n\n2.13      The sections of the Terms of Service that relate to the data processing complained of are as follows:\n\n“**_Our Services:_**\n\n_Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.

A chronology of issues that arose in this regard (1) as between the parties and (2) as between the parties and the Commission in the course of establishing the substantive scope of the Complaint is included in Schedule 1**.** Also included in Schedule 1 are details of the approach I have adopted in determining the scope of the Complaint. In determining the precise parameters of the scope of the Complaint, I have had regard to the Complaint as a whole and, in particular, have taken note of the express statements in the Complaint which define its scope. I have also had regard to the Investigator’s analysis in respect of the scope of the Complaint.\n\n2.15 On his assessment of the Complaint, the Investigator concluded that there were four key issues to be analysed in the context of his Inquiry: [[8]](#_ftn8)\n\na.       Whether clicking “accept” on the Terms of Service was to be construed as an act of consent, or must be an act of consent, to the processing of personal data for the purposes of the GDPR – **the Investigator’s conclusions 1 and 2 of the Final Report address this issue**\n\nb.       Whether Facebook could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for processing personal data with respect to its Terms of Service – **the Investigator’s conclusion 3 of the Final Report addresses this issue**\n\nc.       Whether Facebook misrepresented the legal basis for processing in a manner that caused the Complainant to believe that consent was relied upon – **the Investigator’s conclusions 4 and 10 of the Final Report address this issue** \n\nd.       Whether Facebook had failed to provide the necessary information regarding its legal basis for processing in connection with its Terms of Service and Data Policy – **the**\n\n**Investigator’s conclusions 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Final Report address this issue**\n\n2.16           I agree with the Investigator’s summary of the core issues in respect of issues (a) and (b). In respect of issues (c) and (d), however, I take a different view. \n\n2.17           Issue (c), as identified by the Investigator, solely addresses the allegation that Facebook has misrepresented the lawful basis relied on in connection with the Terms of Service. I agree that this issue falls within the scope of the Complaint. Issue (d), however, was treated by the Investigator as a generalised assessment of whether Facebook’s Data Policy complies with Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as a whole with regard to processing conducted on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. This is based on the fact that the Complaint states, in generalised terms, that:\n\n“_It remains, nevertheless, unclear which exact processing operations the controller chooses to base on each specific legal basis under Article 6 and Article 9 of the GDPR._\n\n_The controller simply lists all six bases for lawful processing under Article 6 of the GDPR in its privacy policy without stating exactly which legal basis the controller relies upon for each specific processing operation.”[**[9]**](#_ftn9)_\n\n2.18           It is on that basis that the Investigator interpreted the scope of the Complaint as comprising the allegation that the Data Policy breaches Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. It is crucial, however, to view the above quotation in the context of the subsequent statement which says:\n\n“_In any case, the controller required the data subject to “agree” to the entire privacy policy and to the new terms._\n\n_This leads to our preliminary assumption, that all processing operations described therein are based on consent, or that the controller at least led the data subject to believe that all these processing operations are (also) based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or 9(2)(a) of the GDPR_.”[[10]](#_ftn10) \n\n2.19           I do not accept that the factual question of whether Facebook “misled” the data subject (i.e. issue (c)) is a separate legal question from whether Facebook complied with its transparency obligations in the context of processing allegedly carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (i.e. issue (d)). There is no distinct legal issue raised by the question whether, as a matter of fact, the Complainant did or did not believe that the processing was based on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (i.e. consent) and not on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (i.e. necessity for the performance of a contract). If Facebook has breached its transparency obligations, it logically follows that the Complainant will have been unlawfully “misled”, whether deliberately or otherwise. If Facebook has complied with its transparency obligations, it cannot be the case that the Complainant was unlawfully misled. On that basis, my view is that issues (c) and (d) are essentially concerned with the same issue. \n\n2.20           In the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant’s representative argues that the questions answered by the Preliminary Draft Decision do “_not even come close_” to covering all aspects of the Complaint.[[11]](#_ftn11) However, it is clear, as set out herein and in Schedule 1, that this Complaint is limited to allegedly unlawful processing carried out on foot of the “agreement” i.e. the acceptance of the Terms of Service, and the extent to which the nature of that agreement was misleading.  I therefore do not accept that the questions addressed in the Preliminary Draft Decision do not cover all aspects of the Complaint.\n\n2.21           The Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision further argue that there has been a failure to investigate the relevant facts. It is argued that there is a fundamental disagreement as to whether the agreement the Complainant has accepted is “a contract” or “a consent”.[[12]](#_ftn12) This issue was dealt with extensively in the Preliminary Draft Decision and is determined below in this Decision.  \n\n2.22           While the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision call for the Commission to engage in a thorough investigation as to the nature of this agreement, having regard to the scope of the Complaint, this is, in my view, entirely unnecessary and would not divulge any new Information or serve a useful purpose at this stage. As is set out in Section 3 below, there is no dispute in relation to the fact that there is a contract between Facebook and the Complainant or the fact no consent within the meaning of the GDPR has been provided by the Complainant in concluding the “agreement” in dispute. What is in dispute, as set out in detail in this Decision and in Schedule 1, is the lawfulness of the personal data processing and the transparency of the information provided.\n\n2.23           Following the circulation of the Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, the supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Portugal raised objections in relation to the Commission’s assessment of the scope of the Complaint, as summarised above.\n\nHaving considered those objections, the EDPB determined, at paragraph 197 of the Article 65 Decision, that the inquiry underpinning this Decision ought to have included an examination of _“[Facebook’s] processing operations, the categories of data processed (including to identify special categories of personal data that may be processed), and the purposes they serve_”.  Accordingly, the EDPB directed, at paragraph 198 of the Article 65 Decision, the Commission to commence a new inquiry into these matters.  While that direction cannot be addressed by the Commission in this Decision, the Commission considers it necessary to note the position, in light of the Commission’s assessment of the scope of the Complaint (as already recorded above) and for the purpose of ensuring compliance with its obligation, pursuant to Article 65(6) GDPR, to adopt its final decision on the basis of the Article 65 Decision.  The EDPB further directed the Commission to remove its proposed conclusion on Finding 1 (as set out in the Draft Decision).  That aspect of matters is addressed at the conclusion of the Commission’s assessment of Issue 1, below.\n\n2.24           On the basis of the above, the issues that will be addressed in this Decision are as follows:\n\n•       Issue 1 – Whether clicking on the “accept” button constitutes or must be considered consent for the purposes of the GDPR\n\n•       Issue 2 – Reliance on Article 6(1)(b) as a lawful basis for personal data processing\n\n•       Issue 3 – Whether Facebook provided the requisite information on the legal basis for processing on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and whether it did so in a transparent manner.\n\n**3** **I****SSUE 1** **–** **W****HETHER C****LICKING ON THE “****ACCEPT”** **B****UTTON C****ONSTITUTES OR MUST BE CONSENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF** **THE GDPR**\n\n## WHETHER THE ACCEPTANCE IS CONSENT\n\n3.1 As I have outlined in Section 2, the Complainant alleges that clicking on the “accept” button of the engagement flow presented to existing users in respect of Facebook’s updated Terms of Service in April 2018 constituted an act of consent by the data subject for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.  The first question to be considered is whether Facebook, via the updated Terms of Service, sought to obtain the Complainant’s “consent” for the purposes of processing of personal data under those Terms of Service. Facebook’s position, as noted above, is that it did not.\n\n3.2 In this regard, I note that the Complainant’s position partly rests on several arguments to the effect that the design of the engagement flow is “_deceptive_”.[[13]](#_ftn13) The Complainant expresses particular concerns in respect of the final stage of the engagement flow and alleges that the acceptance process is set out in a misleading manner, such that a reasonable user would, and indeed the Complainant did in fact, believe that they are consenting for the purposes of Article 6 GDPR to data processing rather than simply signing up to a contract.[[14]](#_ftn14) These arguments in relation to the alleged misleading nature of the user engagement flow will be considered as part of Issue 3 in the context of transparency requirements. This first issue is solely concerned with whether reliance is placed on the legal basis of consent.  \n\n3.3 In this context, I will first consider whether, as a matter of fact, Facebook sought to rely on consent at all as a legal basis. I will subsequently assess whether, as a matter of law, Facebook was obliged to seek consent as a legal basis for processing, as the Complainant argues.\n\n3.4 In its submissions on the Draft Report made to the Investigator, the Complainant argues that the “_scope of application_” of consent and the “_conditions of validity_” under the GDPR must be distinguished. The Complainant further argues that the “_scope_” of consent is any “_expression of will by which the data subject indicates his consent to the processing of his personal data_\".[[15]](#_ftn15) The “_conditions of validity_” are, in the Complainant’s view, the elements of the definition of consent set out in Article 4(11) GDPR. The Complainant further argues that “[t]_o come up with the crazy idea that a violation of the conditions of consent automatically leads to the inapplicability of these conditions is a legal shot in the foot._”[[16]](#_ftn16) The Complainant’s position is that there are some circumstances in which only consent  - and no other legal basis - is applicable, and therefore that there are circumstances where consent must be applicable even if the data controller is not seeking to rely on consent and the definition in Article 4(11) GDPR is not met. In the Complainant’s view, this should result in a declaration that the data processing based on consent is unlawful for want of compliance with these “conditions of validity”. \n\n3.5 Facebook’s position is that “[t]_he agreement to enter into a contract is a wholly separate matter to any form of consent to data processing…_”,[[17]](#_ftn17) and that:\n\n“_Article 4(11) GDPR is not relevant in this instance as Facebook Ireland is not seeking to rely on it (and the alternative legal basis sought to be relied on is valid). It is not the case that all types of processing must be assessed against the formal requirements under Article 4(11) GDPR. Indeed as the Draft Report acknowledges, consent is merely one of six possible bases upon which data processing may be legitimised under Article 6 GDPR. It is Facebook Ireland’s position that an assessment against the formal requirements under Article 4(11) is only necessary and should only be undertaken where a controller purports to rely on consent. Put another way, where the controller relies on a different legal basis for a processing purpose, the analysis as to whether or not the processing is lawful should be undertaken in respect of the specific requirements for only that legal basis._”\n\n3.6 In light of this confirmation by the data controller that it does not seek to rely on consent in this context, there can be no dispute that, as a matter of fact, Facebook is not relying on consent as the lawful basis for the processing complained of. It has nonetheless been argued on the Complainant’s behalf that Facebook _must_ rely on consent, and that Facebook led the Complainant to believe that it was relying on consent. It should be acknowledged that Facebook relies on consent for some personal data processing activities on the platform, which users can provide or not provide through mechanisms distinct from the initial accepting of the Terms of Service.\n\n3.7        The Investigator expressed the view that:\n\n“_…while the GDPR specifies that certain well-defined agreements as to processing (i.e. consent, as defined by the conditions set out in Article 4(11)) may legitimise processing under Article 6(1)(a), it does not expressly require that all agreements regarding processing must be legitimised on this basis._”19\n\n3.8 Article 4 GDPR, as its title makes clear, sets out a series of definitions applicable under the GDPR as a whole. Article 4(11) GDPR merely defines consent for the purposes of the GDPR, including for\n\nthe purpose of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 7 GDPR which sets out certain conditions for consent where it is being relied upon as the legal basis of processing. Article 4(11) GDPR does not, however, purport to determine the circumstances in which consent may be relied upon as a legal basis. While consent for the purposes of the GDPR must satisfy the definition in Article 4(11) GDPR, that provision does not in itself determine the circumstances in which consent may be relied upon as a legal basis for processing. Any other reading of Article 4(11) GDPR is not consistent with a systematic reading of the GDPR when it is clear that the legislator intended Article 4 GDPR to provide definitions. Other definitions, such as that of “controller”, “processor”, “main establishment” and “cross-border processing” are clearly just that: definitions. In any event, I am of the view that, in the context of this Complaint, this issue is an academic one. The key point for the purpose of this Decision is that Facebook never sought to obtain consent from users through the clicking of “accept” to the Terms of Service. \n\n3.9 I put the views set out above to the Parties in the Preliminary Draft Decision. Facebook submitted that “_the Complainant’s position is legally and factually wrong_” and that Facebook “…_does not seek to obtain consent to data processing from users when users are asked to contractually agree to its Terms of Service_”.[[18]](#_ftn18) Moreover, Facebook submits that it:\n\n“…_did not request or require the data subject’s consent to processing described in the Data Policy nor did it seek the data subject’s consent to the processing described in, or otherwise performed for the purposes of, the Terms of Service, and as a consequence that the data subject did not in fact consent in this manner_”.21 \n\n3.10 This confirms the position set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision: Facebook did not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing in this context. On this basis, Facebook expressed its agreement with the provisional finding that “_it is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to deliver the Terms of Service and endorses the unequivocal decision of the Commission to reject the_ [Complainant’s] _argumen_t…”.[[19]](#_ftn19)  \n\n3.11 In contrast, the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision argue that the alleged contract is an example of _falsa demonstratio_ i.e. that Facebook has held out particular clauses as constituting part of a contract when, as a matter of law, they actually do not.23 The Complainant in this regard relies on the perceived intention of the parties, the “_economic background and common understanding_”, and the fact that the shift from reliance on consent to reliance on necessity for the performance of a contract was recent.\n\n3.12 While this argument may be relevant in the context of reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – which is considered as the second issue below – it does not address the essential issue arising for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In this case, Facebook is not relying on consent as a legal basis for processing of personal data under the Terms of Service. Indeed, the parties appear to agree that acceptance of the Terms of Service is not valid consent for the purposes of the GDPR.\n\n3.13 For these reasons, I proposed, by way of the Draft Decision, to conclude that, as a matter of fact, Facebook did not rely, or purport to rely, on the Complainant’s consent as a legal basis for the processing of personal data under the Terms of Service.  \n\nAs noted already above, however, the EDPB instructed the Commission (by way of paragraph 198 of the Article 65 Decision) to remove, from its Draft Decision, “its conclusion on Finding 1”.  Finding 1 included proposed conclusions on two linked questions, namely: (i) whether Facebook sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Service; and (ii) whether Facebook was legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so.  Given that my previously proposed conclusion (as noted immediately above) in relation to the first of these questions is encompassed by the EDPB’s instruction, I make no finding on this first question.\n\n## WHETHER THE CONTROLLER MUST RELY ON CONSENT\n\n3.14 Based on a new understanding of this issue that evolved during the course of this Inquiry, the Complainant made what I consider to be an alternative argument: namely, that Facebook was legally obliged to rely on consent and that, as Facebook has not done so, the processing was consequently unlawful. \n\n3.15 In the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, it is denied that the Complainant advanced such an argument.[[20]](#_ftn20) I have dealt with this point in part in footnote 36 of Schedule 1. It remains the case that the Complainant has argued that where “_the subject matter of the declaration of intent…is primarily data processing_”[[21]](#_ftn21) the appropriate legal basis must derive from Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, and where the subject matter of the contractual offer “_is primarily some other contractual service_”,[[22]](#_ftn22) the legal basis can derive from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. In my view, it is difficult to interpret this as anything other than an argument that consent is the only appropriate legal basis for agreements primarily concerning data processing. This is, to put it another way, a suggestion that consent is a higher order of legal basis, at least in respect of agreements that primarily involve data processing. This being so, and for completeness, I will now consider whether consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR _must_ be relied on by the controller in this context.\n\n3.16 The Investigator points out that the Complaint begins by claiming that the data subject “_had to agree to_” Facebook’s Terms of Service and Data Policy at the time of the update in April 2018.[[23]](#_ftn23) In my view it is critically important to distinguish between agreeing to a contract (which may involve processing of personal data) and providing consent to personal data processing specifically for the purposes of legitimising that personal data processing under the GDPR. As noted by the EDPB, these are entirely distinct concepts which “_have different requirements and legal consequences_”.[[24]](#_ftn24)  In particular, these are distinct legal bases for the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) GDPR, with all the consequences that this entails.\n\n3.17 In this context, it is important to emphasise that GDPR does not set out any form of hierarchy of lawful bases that can be used for processing personal data, whether by reference to the categories of personal data or otherwise.[[25]](#_ftn25) There is no question that “_one ground has normative priority over the others_”.[[26]](#_ftn26) This position is reflected in the Guidance of the Article 29 Working Party, which, although not legally binding, is nonetheless instructive in considering this issue.[[27]](#_ftn27) I also note that, in the context of Directive 95/46/EC, which preceded the GDPR, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“the **CJEU**”) has explicitly held that obtaining the data subject’s consent is not a requirement for reliance on the “legitimate interests” legal basis.[[28]](#_ftn28) The CJEU thereby rejected the argument that consent was a necessary legal basis in circumstances where the data controller sought to rely on another legal basis under Article 7 of the Directive. I have been pointed to no authority which supports the view that there is a particular lawful basis that is intrinsically preferable over others, or that one legal basis has legal primacy over any other, or that fulfilling one legal basis is a precondition for fulfilling a separate legal basis. In these circumstances, the reasoning of the CJEU in respect of Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC is equally applicable to Article 6 GDPR. Indeed, notwithstanding the thrust of the argument initially advanced, the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision now acknowledge that there is no hierarchy of legal bases under the GDPR.[[29]](#_ftn29)\n\n3.18 For this reason, if and insofar as it arises, I conclude that neither Article 6(1) GDPR nor any provision of the GDPR requires that the processing of personal data in particular contexts must necessarily be based on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.\n\n3.19 In many cases involving a contract between a consumer and an organisation, the lawful basis for processing of personal data is “_necessity for the performance of a contract_” under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. It cannot be said that the fact of agreeing to certain contractual terms necessarily means that any processing of personal data under such contract is based on consent for the purposes of the GDPR. The question of whether a data controller can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR turns on the terms of the particular contract, and whether the impugned processing operation(s) is/are necessary in order to bring about the performance of that contract. The nature and content of a contract freely entered into by two parties cannot, however, introduce a higher category of, or ‘default’, legal basis. Nothing in the GDPR supports the view that there is any such higher category or default legal basis.[[30]](#_ftn30) I also note in this regard that the EDPB has advised that, in circumstances in which data processing is necessary to perform a contract, consent is not, in fact, an appropriate lawful basis on which to rely.[[31]](#_ftn31)  \n\n3.20 I note, in this regard, that the Complainant has argued that a contract for a service with a social network “_primarily_” concerns data processing and on this basis should be based on consent.36 At the same time, the Complainant asserts that the data processing in question is in fact not necessary for the performance of that same contract. I am unaware of any case-law or authority that suggest that companies cannot rely, at least in part, on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data simply because their businesses “_primarily_” concern data processing.  \n\n3.21 In truth, the Complainant’s arguments in this respect appear to be made in support of the separate argument that Facebook cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a lawful basis for processing. If the Complainant succeeds in that latter argument, it follows that another legal basis must be relied on and in this instance, in the Complainant’s view, that legal basis would have to be consent. In my view, this alternative argument – to the effect that consent is the only remaining possible lawful basis because no other basis can be used lawfully for this particular agreement – is properly considered in the context of the second issue in the complaint, i.e. whether Facebook is entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.\n\n3.22     Finally, I note the Complainant’s reliance on Article 7(2) GDPR, which states:\n\n“_If the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding._”\n\n3.23         I also note the Complainant’s reliance on Article 7(4) GDPR, which states:\n\n“_When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract._”\n\n3.24 Article 7 GDPR concerns ‘conditions for consent’ and is only relevant for consideration where consent is being relied upon as the legal basis for processing in the first instance. This was the view of Advocate General Szpunar in _Planet49._[[32]](#_ftn32) Article 7 GDPR is not, in and of itself, indicative of which lawful basis a controller must or indeed should rely on in a particular context. Instead, where a controller is relying on consent, Article 7 GDPR assists in determining whether the ‘conditions for validity’ (to use the Complainant’s own language) have been met. \n\n3.25 I further note that the EDPB Guidelines on consent consider a number of circumstances in which “bundling” (or what the Complainant refers to as “forced consent” or “hidden consent”) may occur. This occurs when consent can neither be freely given nor easily withdrawn because the provision of consent is made part of the terms of a contract, particularly in circumstances where there is an unequal balance of power between the data controller and the data subject.[[33]](#_ftn33) This, however, only becomes relevant when the controller purports to rely on consent in the first place. \n\n3.26 Having considered the submissions of the parties, including the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, I proposed to conclude, in the Draft Decision, that the legal basis for processing of personal data under the Terms of Service between Facebook and its users, including the Complainant, does not, as a matter of law, have to be consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and, as a matter of fact, Facebook does not rely on consent for this purpose and the agreement to the Terms of Service does not constitute consent for the purposes of the GDPR.  \n\nAs noted already above, however, the EDPB instructed the Commission (by way of paragraph 198 of the Article 65 Decision) to remove, from its Draft Decision, “its conclusion on Finding\n\n1”.  \n\n**Accordingly, I make no finding on the matters encompassed by the above assessment of Issue 1.**\n\n### 4      ISSUE 2 - RELIANCE ON ARTICLE 6(1)(B) GDPR AS A LAWFUL BASIS FOR PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING\n\n4.1 As set out above, the Complainant contends that Facebook’s processing of personal data under the Terms of Service must be based entirely on consent as a legal basis under the GDPR. The Complainant’s argument also rests on the contention that Facebook cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  to process personal data in order to perform the Terms of Service.\n\n4.2 In considering this issue, I will first address the relationship between the Terms of Service and the Data Policy.  This assessment is necessary as the Complainant argues that she “agreed” to the Data Policy by accepting Facebook’s updated Terms of Service. Facebook has argued that this position is not correct.  After coming to a conclusion on this matter, I will then consider the substantive question of whether Facebook is entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for the processing of personal data.\n\n## THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND DATA POLICY\n\n4.3 The Complainant alleges that in clicking the “accept” button, she agreed to both the Data Policy and the Terms of Service and that the alleged non-compliance is compounded by the agreement to both documents.[[34]](#_ftn34) In examining this aspect of the Complaint, the Investigator was of the view that that the data subject’s formal agreement to the Data Policy was not a component of the data subject’s contract with Facebook. The Investigator also acknowledged in the Final Report that the Complainant seems to have conceded that there is no “consent” and therefore no “agreement” to the Data Policy.[[35]](#_ftn35) \n\n4.4 In respect of this matter, the Investigator concluded that, as Facebook has stated that the Terms of Service “_make up this entire agreement_” between Facebook and the Facebook user, there is no explicit indication, in the view of the Investigator, that Facebook intends the separate Data Policy to be part of that agreement. When Facebook sought agreement to the terms under dispute in this Inquiry, it invited users to also accept the updated Terms of Service and also included information on the Data Policy. In the Investigator’s view, this illustrates that the Terms of Service and the Data Policy are entirely separate. Facebook’s position is that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document setting out information required by the GDPR, whereas the contractual document is the Terms of Service.[[36]](#_ftn36)\n\n4.5 I note, therefore, the Investigator’s consideration of whether the Complainant was forced to consent to all of the processing operations set out in the Data Policy. In my view, the acceptance in question is not an act of consent but, on its terms, constituted acceptance of, or agreement to, a contract i.e. the Terms of Service. Although the Data Policy was hyperlinked in the final stage of the engagement flow, I am not satisfied that the Data Policy was thereby incorporated into the Terms of Service.  The “accept” button clearly referred to acceptance of the “terms” as distinct from the Data Policy (and indeed the Cookies Policy).  In my view, the Data Policy is as Facebook has characterised it:\n\n“_While the Terms of Service list Facebook Ireland’s services and obligations, the delivery and discharge of which require certain processing of personal data, they do not attempt to comprehensively list Facebook’s Ireland’s processing since the Data Policy does this and is the primary document to be considered when it comes to Facebook Ireland’s GDPR obligations under Article 13. The distinct objectives and nature of these documents is further outlined in Sections 2 and 3 above where we have explained that agreement is merely sought to the Terms of Service but not for the Data Policy which functions as a transparency and not a contractual document._”[[37]](#_ftn37)\n\n4.6 The Data Policy is a document through which Facebook seeks to comply with particular provisions of the GDPR in relation to transparency, whereas the Terms of Service is the contract between Facebook and its user. Facebook relies on various legal bases for various data processing operations, some of which are based on consent and some of which are based on contractual necessity. Where the legal basis of contractual necessity is relied on, the contract in question is the Terms of Service. In my view, the contract in question, and therefore the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR must take place, is the Terms of Service only. The Data Policy is only relevant insofar as it sheds light on the processing operations carried out for which Facebook relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. It is essentially an explanatory document. After considering these views, which were set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision, Facebook expressed agreement with the provisional conclusions of the Commission in this regard.[[38]](#_ftn38) The Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision did not express any further views on this issue.\n\n4.7 The Data Policy itself references a very wide range of processing operations. As noted in Schedule 1, the Complainant sought to direct the Commission to conduct an assessment of all processing operations carried out by Facebook. I have explained why it is not open to a Complainant – who must present a complaint with a reasonable degree of specificity – to demand such an assessment. While the Complaint refers to various examples of data processing, e.g. the processing of behavioural data, it does not go so far as to directly link the Complaint to specific processing operations by reference to an identifiable body of data with any great clarity or precision. In the circumstances, it is necessary to consider the issue relating to reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR at the level of principle, and my findings are made on that basis.\n\n4.8 More specifically, insofar as the Complaint refers to particular processing activities, it has a specific  focus on data processed to facilitate behavioural advertising. This will accordingly be the focus of the analysis in this Decision. \n\n4.9 In order to ensure that this Inquiry has a reasonable degree of specificity, I will therefore consider whether Facebook can, in principle, rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for processing under the contract, including and in particular in the context of behavioural advertising.\n\n## THE COMPLAINT, THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES, AND THE REPORT\n\n4.10 The Complainant argues that Facebook is not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, i.e. personal data processing that is necessary for the performance of a contract, as a legal basis. The Complainant contends that Facebook could only rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in respect of processing that is “strictly necessary” to perform the contract, and that such processing must be linked to “core” functions of the contract. To support this view, the Complainant relies on Opinion 06/2014 of the Article 29 Working Party which recommended that “[t]he _contractual necessity lawful basis must be interpreted strictly and does not cover situations where the processing is not genuinely necessary for the performance of a contract, but rather unilaterally imposed on the data subject by the controller_”.[[39]](#_ftn39)[[40]](#_ftn40)\n\n4.11 Specifically, the Complainant argues that the personalisation of posts and communication features constitutes a “core” element of Facebook’s contract, but that personalised advertising does not. The Complainant’s position is premised on the idea that there is an identifiable “purpose” or “core” of each contract which is discernible by reference to the contract as a whole and the intention of the parties (as opposed to being strictly limited to the text of the contract). The Complainant is therefore asking that an assessment of the Terms of Service be carried out to determine what the “core” purpose of the contract is. It would follow from the Complainant’s position that any processing that is not strictly necessary to fulfil these “core” purposes or objectives, cannot be carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.\n\n4.12 The Complainant takes issue with a lack of “differentiation” as between specific clauses or elements of the contract in the Commission’s approach.[[41]](#_ftn41) The Complainant argues that “_investigation_” and “_fact finding_” should have taken place in order to determine what specific elements of the contract are used by Facebook to justify specific processing operations. Firstly, it\n\nis clear from the Terms of Service, which is, in the Complainant’s own words, a very descriptive document, that Facebook intends to provide behavioural advertising as part of its contractual service. While my view, as set out in Section 5 below, is that there have been significant failings of transparency in relation to this processing, that does not change this basic fact that behavioural advertising forms part of the service offered by Facebook. As noted above, the Complaint has a specific focus on behavioural advertising. On that basis, and having regard to the need for a reasonable degree of specificity in the presentation and investigation of complaints, it is not necessary to undertake a comprehensive investigation of each and every processing operation under the Terms of Service. I also emphasise, as I explain in further detail below, that I intend to order Facebook to bring its documents into compliance for transparency purposes. Such an order would vindicate the right of the Complainant and data subjects as a whole to get an answer to “_which specific clauses of the “Terms of Service” are used by Facebook to justify the specific purpose of its processing, the type of data processed, and the applicable legal basis_.”[[42]](#_ftn42) What such information would not do, is assist in deciding the question of principle as to whether Facebook can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in order to provide a service that includes behavioural or targeted advertising.\n\n4.13 As a preliminary matter, I emphasise that issues of interpretation and validity of national contract law are not directly within the Commission’s competence.  Nonetheless, it is important to note that the legal concept of a “purpose” or “core” of a contract is one more often found in civil law jurisdictions. The Commission’s role is in any event limited to interpreting and applying the GDPR and, in interpreting and applying Article 6(1)(b) GDPR specifically, it must always be borne in mind that the Commission is not competent to rule directly on matters of national contract law or to determine questions of the general validity of a contract.\n\n4.14 In this regard, I note that the Complainant explicitly sought to have the Commission investigate and make findings in respect of contract and consumer law. In the Preliminary Draft Decision I stated that I agree with the position of the Investigator that this falls outside the remit of a supervisory authority under the GDPR and is, in any case, the subject of both an Austrian consumer case against Facebook being pursued by Mr. Schrems, Honorary Chair of noyb, over the last 6 years,[[43]](#_ftn43) and the _Bundeskartellamt_ case being pursued by that office since 2016.[[44]](#_ftn44) I further noted that the Investigator correctly drew the Complaint’s attention to the relevant Irish consumer and competition authorities, which have competence in this regard. I went on to observe that these legal regimes would be a more appropriate avenue for the Complainant to ventilate the issues surrounding contract law referred to above.\n\n4.15 In the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant took issue with these provisional conclusions. They were described as “_a perversion of justice_”, “_an insult to any informed reader_”, “_a cheap trick”,_ “_simply a lie_”, “_(at best) too_ _lazy_” and “_a wilful abuse of office_”, all within the same fifteen lines of text.[[45]](#_ftn45) The Commission rejects, in the strongest terms, these serious allegations of _mala fides_, dishonesty and otherwise illegal conduct. Such allegations go far beyond what is commonly encountered in even the most robustly argued set of submissions in an adversarial regulatory dispute. They have, moreover, been made without any foundation in fact or evidence and appear to be based solely on the fact that the there is a difference between the Complainant’s/the Complainant’s representative’s interpretation of the law and the interpretation of the law set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision. The fact that the Complainant and/or the Complainant’s representative have presented their arguments in this way is not conducive to the proper handling and investigation of Complaints and is to be regretted.\n\n4.16 The Complainant argues that in order to determine the nature of the “agreement”, it is necessary to fully inquire into the nature and scope of the agreement, and to apply Austrian contract law in so doing. In making this argument, the Complainant relies on a number of principles of contract law including Directive 93/13/EC (“the **Unfair Terms Directive**”). Reliance on the law of contract and on the Unfair Terms Directive is misplaced. If the Complainant contends that there is no contract, or that aspects of the Terms of Service do not constitute a lawfully formed contract or lawful and/or fair terms of the contract, it is open to her to pursue this matter before a relevant authority or before a court of law. The Commission is not empowered to make decisions as to the validity of contracts, be they consumer contracts or otherwise and, in particular, it has no jurisdiction whatsoever to make decisions in respect of Austrian contract law. The Commission is tasked with interpreting and applying the GDPR. Where the GDPR refers to a contract, the Commission cannot determine the interpretation and validity of such a contract for the purposes of the law more generally. The Commission is no more empowered to do this by law than it would be to declare processing based on compliance with a legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR to be unlawful simply because a complainant would argue that the legal obligation being relied on was unconstitutional in their country. These are matters for the national courts or such other bodies as may be conferred with the jurisdiction to make such determinations under domestic law. Any such decision on the part of the Commission would be _ultra vires_ the 2018 Act, for reasons explained in detail when I considered the extent of the Commission’s powers earlier in this Decision. I do not accept that this amounts to “_a denial of justice_”,[[46]](#_ftn46) for the reasons there set out. \n\n4.17 The Complainant argues that the “Our Services” section of the Terms of Service “_are all neutral factual descriptions. Neither a duty of the user nor a service from Facebook results from the wording_”.[[47]](#_ftn47) The Complainant also argues that showing any user advertisements is a “_factual procedure_” rather than a contractual obligation or duty.52 In addition, the Complainant’s argument endeavours to draw a distinction between “_implicit consent_”, i.e. some form of agreement that is implicit or obvious within a contract for services, and “_compulsory consent_”, i.e. consent which is made contingent on the acceptance of a contract.[[48]](#_ftn48) Applying the narrow interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR that is proposed by the Complainant, the argument is that the processing required to deliver the “factual” services set out in the contract cannot fall within Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. This rests on the aforementioned distinction drawn by the Complainant between processing that is strictly necessary to deliver the “core” objectives of the service i.e. providing a social network, and factual events simply mentioned or described in the contract i.e. showing advertisements. \n\n4.18 The Complainant has further argued that this “take it or leave it” approach to signing up or continuing to use Facebook (to use the Complainant’s terminology) in any event does not constitute processing that is permitted by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. To assess whether the Complainant’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is correct, I must first consider whether the processing which is carried out on foot of the acceptance of the contract is necessary to perform that contract.  In essence, this requires an assessment of whether the services offered by Facebook pursuant to the contract are necessary to fulfil the contract’s core functions.\n\n4.19 In advancing the argument that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can only be relied on to legitimise data processing that constitutes “a core element of a social network”,[[49]](#_ftn49) the Complainant relies on guidance of the EDPB. Moreover, the Complainant argues that, _inter alia_, Facebook has made a “_ridiculous and impractical assertion that advertising (and similar secondary processing) is a core service._”[[50]](#_ftn50) The Complainant further argues that:\n\n“_Other elements which represent the core product of the platform (e.g. the user's page, exchange of news, contact book, photo uploads) are, according to the public opinion, certainly the subject of the product \"social network\" and thus the subject of the contract - irrespective of the designation in the clauses._”\n\n4.20 The Complainant is therefore of the view that this particular interpretation should be applied to the circumstances of the Complaint by conducting an assessment as to what constitutes the “core” of the contract between the user and Facebook. The argument is that any services (such as, in the Complainant’s view, advertising and “secondary processing”) which do not form part of\n\nthe activities which are strictly necessary to fulfil the core objective of the contract cannot be rendered lawful by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.\n\n4.21 Put very simply, the Complainant is advancing a narrow and purpose-based interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that argues that the data processing should be the least invasive processing possible in order to fulfil the objective of the contract (here, what the overall contract sets out to do, rather than only what the contract says). In contrast, Facebook is advancing a broader interpretation that facilitates a certain degree of contractual freedom in relation to how broad the data processing might be, provided that the processing is in fact necessary to perform a term of the specific contract. Facebook argues that it is entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to deliver services in a contract even if that processing is not the most minimal processing available to it in order to deliver the service being provided.\n\n4.22 Facebook argues that there is no basis to contend that Facebook, in clearly relying on a contract with the user, has attempted to mislead the user and to “infer” consent from a user. Facebook’s position is that the condition of necessity for contractual performance “_does not mean that processing must be essential to the performance of the contract, or the only way to perform the underlying contract_”.[[51]](#_ftn51) Facebook emphasises that, rather than being required to use the most minimal processing possible in order to perform the contract, contractual freedom must allow the parties to exercise a certain element of agency in coming to an agreement, even where that agreement might involve the delivery of a service primarily using data processing. Facebook’s position is therefore that the Complainant’s interpretation (and proposed application) of the GDPR is incorrect and excessively narrow, insofar as the contract between Facebook and its users are concerned.\n\n4.23 Facebook also argues that there is an absence of meaningful rationale in the Complaint as to why any of the elements of its service described in Section 1 of its Terms of Service cannot be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. It submits that “_Article 6(1)(b) forms part of the right to data protection, it is not a derogation or limitation on the right. It operates as a safeguard by explaining the circumstances in which the personal data can be processed_”.[[52]](#_ftn52) Facebook’s position is that the Commission should apply a broader interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, such that processing that is necessary to deliver a contract can be lawful irrespective of whether the specific processing is essential, or the most minimal way, to deliver the service. In relation to targeted behavioural advertising specifically, Facebook argues that:\n\n“_Beyond ensuring the continued financing of the provision and development of the Service, which is itself of significant benefit to users (as the Complaint explicitly recognises), the data processing activities undertaken by Facebook Ireland primarily enable Facebook_\n\n_Ireland to provide its personalised services to users (including curating individual’s News_\n\n_Feed, the content they see, connections suggested, advertising and other commercial content, shortcuts suggested and elements of the features they can enjoy). This is itself the core of the Service and one of the principal reasons why users value the Service over and above the services provided by Facebook Ireland’s competitors_.”[[53]](#_ftn53)\n\n4.24 The Investigator acknowledged the difficulties in interpreting contractual necessity _in vacuo_, where there is limited harmonisation of contract law at European level and where the Commission is not competent to rule on matters of contract law.[[54]](#_ftn54) The Investigator expressed particular doubts about applying a test based on what is necessary to fulfil the core functions/objectives of a contract given the lack of certainty surrounding it.[[55]](#_ftn55) The Investigator concluded that the concept of necessity in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR “_includes processing which is necessary to perform the full agreement entered into between the parties, including optional or conditional elements of contract._”.[[56]](#_ftn56)\n\n4.25 The Investigator’s position is in contrast to that of the Complainant, which is that “necessity” should be assessed strictly by reference to its meaning as an element in the proportionality test in applying Article 52(1) of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (“the **Charter**”), i.e. that the measure be strictly necessary in order to fulfil the objective. \n\n## WHETHER FACEBOOK CAN RELY ON ARTICLE 6(1)(B) GDPR\n\n4.26 In coming to a conclusion on this matter in the Preliminary Draft Decision, I had regard to the Guidelines of the EDPB on processing for online services based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. While these Guidelines are not strictly binding and address this issue in general terms, they are nonetheless instructive in considering this issue. The Guidelines state in clear terms that “_the processing in question must be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract with a data subject_”.[[57]](#_ftn57) In my view, this turns on a consideration of what is meant by the concepts of “performance, “necessity” and “contract” as understood in the context of data protection law and the application of these concepts to the specific contract relied upon for the purposes of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. This remains my view in the context of this Decision.\n\n4.27 It is, in my view, important to have regard not just to the concept of what is “necessary”, but also to the concept of “performance”. The EDPB has stated that the controller should ensure “_that processing is necessary in order that the particular contract with the data subject can be performed._”[[58]](#_ftn58) A contract is performed when each party discharges their contractual obligations as has been agreed by reference to the bargain struck between the parties. It follows that what is “necessary” for the performance of a contract is anything that, if it did not take place, would mean the specific contract had not been performed. In this regard, I note that the mere inclusion of a term in a contract does not necessarily mean that it is necessary to perform the particular contract. This understanding is consistent with the EDPB Guidance which states that the processing will be necessary for the performance of a contract if “_the main subject-matter of the specific contract with the data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur_”.[[59]](#_ftn59) It remains the case however that necessity cannot be considered entirely in the abstract, and careful regard must be had for what is necessary for the performance of the specific contract freely entered into by the parties.\n\n4.28      The EDPB states that there is:\n\n“_…a distinction between processing activities necessary for the performance of a contract, and terms making the service conditional on certain processing activities that are not in fact necessary for the performance of the contract. ‘Necessary for performance’ clearly requires something more than a contractual condition_” [my emphasis].[[60]](#_ftn60)\n\n4.29      The Guidelines also set out that controller should:\n\n“_demonstrate how the main object of the specific contract with the data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur. The important issue here is the nexus between the personal data and processing operations concerned, and the performance or non-performance of the service provided under the contract._”[[61]](#_ftn61)\n\n4.30 On the question of necessity, I note that the EDPB has stated that the meaning of necessity as understood in EU law must be considered when having regard to a provision of EU law, including data protection law.[[62]](#_ftn62) This is an uncontroversial statement. I also note that in _Heinz Huber v Bundesrepublik Deutschland_, the CJEU held in the context of Directive 95/46 that necessity is an existing principle of EU law that must be interpreted in a manner that “_reflects the objective of that directive_”.[[63]](#_ftn63) It is important to highlight, as the Investigator has,[[64]](#_ftn64) that in the same case the\n\nCJEU held that processing beyond the most minimal to meet the objective will still meet the necessity test if it renders a lawful objective “more effective”.[[65]](#_ftn65) However, the EDPB proposes clear limits to this by stating “_merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b)._”[[66]](#_ftn66) \n\n4.31 The EDPB Guidelines assess necessity by reference to the “core” function of the contract. This is supportive of the Complainant’s position that the “core” functions of a contract must be assessed in order to determine what processing is objectively necessary in order to perform it. I agree with this assessment for the reasons set out by the EDPB. In this vein, I would add that necessity is to be determined by reference to the particular contract as between the parties.  Indeed, the question to be asked is whether the processing operation(s) is/are is necessary to fulfil the “_specific_”[[67]](#_ftn67)  or “_particular_”73 contract with the data subject.  This is the view taken by the EDPB and, as Article 6(1)(b) GDPR clearly refers to the specific contract between a data controller and a data subject, I am in agreement with the EDPB in this regard.\n\n4.32 In accordance with the EDPB Guidelines, the processing in question must be more than simply the processing of personal data which is referenced in the terms of the contract. Rather, it must be necessary in order to fulfil the clearly stated and understood objectives or “core” of the contract. The “core functions” cannot, however, be considered in isolation from the meaning of “performance”, the meaning of “necessity” as set out above, and the content of the specific contract in question. The question is therefore not what is necessary to fulfil the objectives of “a social network” in a general sense, but what is necessary to fulfil the core functions of the particular contract between Facebook and Facebook users. In order to carry out this assessment, it is therefore necessary to consider the contract itself.\n\n4.33 I recall my earlier statement that matters of national contract law are outside the scope of the Commission.[[68]](#_ftn68)  Nonetheless, for the purposes of data protection law, I note that the EDPB indicates that, in such an assessment, “_regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service_”.75 In my view, when examining what constitutes a “contract” for the purposes of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the term “contract” does not necessarily refer to the entirety of the (written) agreement between the parties. Rather, I agree that the correct approach is to examine the actual bargain which has been struck between the parties and determine the core function of the contract by reference to this. Therefore, the inclusion of a term which does not relate to the core function of the contract could not be considered necessary for its performance.  \n\n4.34 As an aid to deciding whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is an appropriate lawful basis, and in particular in considering the scope of the relevant contract,  the EDPB suggests asking:\n\n•       “_What is the nature of the service being provided to the data subject?_  \n\n•       _What are its distinguishing characteristics? What is the exact rationale of the contract (i.e. its substance and fundamental object)?_  \n\n•       _What are the essential elements of the contract?_   \n\n•       _What are the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract?_  \n\n•       _How is the service promoted or advertised to the data subject? Would an ordinary user of the service reasonably expect?_”[[69]](#_ftn69)\n\n4.35           In considering this particular issue in the context of the Complaint, it is necessary to identify the “core” functions of the contract between Facebook and Facebook users.  At this point, I note that the Complaint itself does not specify with any great precision the extent of the processing (or indeed the processing operation(s)) that the Complainant believes is not necessary for the purposes of performing the Terms of Service. The Complainant has however made extensive submissions arguing that the serving of behavioural advertising specifically is not necessary in order to fulfil the “core function” of a social network. As a result, for the purposes of this Complaint, I propose to focus on this element of the Terms of Service.\n\n4.36           The contract between Facebook and Facebook users is divided into the following headings:\n\n•       “To Provide a Personalised Experience for you”; \n\n•       “Connect you with people and organizations you care about”; \n\n•       “Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you”; \n\n•       “Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you”;\n\n•       “Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community”;\n\n•       “Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone”;  and \n\n•       “Enable global access to our services”.\n\n4.37           The first term in the Terms of Service, under the heading “To Provide a Personalised Experience for you”, states that:\n\n“_from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products – to personalize your experience_” [my emphasis].\n\n4.38           As well as the provision relating to advertisements at the beginning of the Terms of Service already set out, I note that under the heading “_Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you_”, the contract states “[w]_e show you ads, offers and other sponsored content to help you to discover content, products and services_…”.\n\n4.39           The Complainant however argues that such advertising referred to in this term is not necessary in order to deliver a social network, and that simply placing these terms in the contract does not make them necessary. Both of these statements may be true, but it does not follow that fulfilling these terms is not necessary in order to fulfil the specific contract with Facebook. To do that, to use the language of the EDPB, it is necessary to consider “_the nature of the service being offered to the data subject_”. Facebook’s argument is essentially that personalised advertising constitutes the “_core_” of its service, and would therefore be the Facebook service’s “_distinguishing characteristics_” (to use the language of the EDPB).[[70]](#_ftn70) The Facebook service is clearly “_promoted_ [and] _advertised_”[[71]](#_ftn71) as being one that provides personalised advertisements, and in my view, a reasonable user would be well-informed, based on public debate of these issues in the media among other matters, that this is the very nature of the service being offered by Facebook and contained within the contract.\n\n4.40           However, the position of the Complainant seems to go so far as to say that processing will generally only be necessary for the performance of the contract if not carrying out the processing would make the performance of the contract impossible. Moreover, the position of the EDPB is that:\n\n“_as a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services. Normally, it would be hard to argue that the contract had not been performed because there were no behavioural ads. This is all the more supported by the fact that data subjects have the absolute right under Article_\n\n_21 to object to processing of their data for direct marketing purposes._”[[72]](#_ftn72)\n\n4.41      The Guidelines, while not binding on the Commission, clearly set out a very restrictive view on when processing should be deemed to be “necessary” for the performance of a contract, and explicitly refer to personalised advertising as an example of processing that will usually not be necessary. As the terms of the guidance makes clear, this is, however, a general rather than an absolute rule. I note the EDPB has also acknowledged that “_personalisation of content may (but does not always) constitute an essential or expected element of certain online services_”.[[73]](#_ftn73) The core area of dispute in applying Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is therefore whether – by reference to the terms of the specific contract – the inclusion of behavioural advertising makes data processing conditional on the delivery of a contract, where that processing is not itself necessary to actually deliver the contract. The counter-argument is that such advertising, being the core of Facebook’s business model and the core of the bargain being struck by Facebook users and Facebook, is necessary to perform the specific contract between Facebook and the Complainant.\n\n4.42 Appling the principles set out above to the particular circumstances of this case, it seems to me that the core of the Facebook model, particularly in circumstances where users do not pay for the service, is an advertising model.[[74]](#_ftn74) The EDPB has, of course, set out that processing cannot be rendered lawful by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR “_simply because processing is necessary for the controller’s wider business model_”.82 The core of the service, however, as set out in the specific contract with the data subject in this case, clearly includes (and indeed appears to be premised upon) the provision of personalised advertising. \n\n4.43 This analysis is reinforced when one answers the specific questions posed at paragraph 33 of the EDPB Guidelines set out above. The nature of the service being offered to Facebook users is set out in the first line of the Terms of Service: a personalised service that includes advertising. Moreover, a distinguishing feature of the Facebook service (that, I think it might be fair to say, the Complainant and Facebook would both agree on) is that it is a service funded by personalised advertising. As the core of the bargain between the parties, this advertising therefore appears to be part of the substance and fundamental object of the contract. It is, in fact, the core element of the commercial transaction as between Facebook and Facebook users. It follows that this is a commercially essential element of the contract. As this information is both clearly set out and publicly available, it is difficult to argue that this is not part of the mutual expectations of a prospective user and of Facebook. Finally, it is clear that the service is advertised (and widely understood) as one funded by personalised advertising, and so any reasonable user would expect and understand that this was the bargain being struck, even if they might prefer that the market would offer them better alternative choices. I therefore expressed the view, in the Preliminary Draft (and Draft) Decision, that the answers to the questions proposed by the EDPB did not support the Complainant’s argument in respect of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the contract concluded between Facebook and the Complainant at issue in this Complaint.\n\n4.44 In the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant argues that this analysis amounts to speculation.[[75]](#_ftn75) While making the argument that the legal analysis must be based on “_hard evidence_” rather than “_views_”, the only evidence put forward by the Complainant is her own statement and a Gallup poll referenced in the Complaint. The Complainant goes on to suggest that “_we might as well ask the Oracle of Delphi what data subjects really know or think and what economics really play out in a contractual relationship_.”[[76]](#_ftn76) While I have had due regard to the matters put forward by the Complainant in support of the Complaint I am obliged to consider all of the evidence before me and I am also entitled to take notice of matters in the public domain. In any event, in this specific context, it is primarily by reference to the contract itself that the question of reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR must be assessed. Having regard to the clear terms of the contract, targeted advertising forms a core element of Facebook’s business model and transaction with users.\n\n4.45 The Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision go on to describe the “_data for service narrative_” as “_economically illiterate_”, “_clearly way too simplistic_”, “_deeply alarming_” and an “_ancient industry lobbyist narrative_”.85 In support of these assertions, it is argued that each visit to Facebook involves spending time, “_the most important online currency on Facebook_”. The submissions further argue that Facebook can only profit from advertising because users provide relevant content to other users with no remuneration. \n\n4.46 The fact that a user spending additional time on a platform is more lucrative for Facebook does nothing to rebut the argument that targeted advertising lies at the core of the agreement. The more time a user spends engaging with the platform, the more advertisements they will be exposed to and the more data they will provide. Indeed, even if one uncritically accepts this argument, it may be regarded as reinforcing the conclusion that the core of the business model is the provision of data on personal activity to facilitate targeted advertising. The fact that intra-user activity enables profit does not alter where those profits come from, or the nature of the agreement and what is necessary in order to perform it. It is clear that the Complainant regards this state of affairs as being unfair and/or unbalanced. Whether it is or it is not, this does not alter the fact that the service in question is provided to users on this very basis.\n\n4.47 I have already pointed out that the Guidelines are non-binding and do not determine the application of the general principles to specific cases. I agree with the majority of the arguments of both the Complainant and the EDPB in relation to the correct interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.[[77]](#_ftn77) However, I have difficulty with a strict threshold of “impossibility” in the assessment of necessity. By “impossibility”, I am referring to the argument put forward that a particular term of\n\na contract (here, behavioural advertising) is not necessary to deliver an overall service or contract.  In particular, I consider that is not correct to assess necessity as against the delivery of an overall service in the abstract.  Rather, as I have stated above, I consider the appropriate assessment to be one which considers what is necessary by reference to core function of the particular contract. \n\n4.48 While I accept that either form of assessment will require an element of reasoning in the abstract (in particular, when considering the mutual perspectives and expectations), I am also of the view that it is not for an authority such as the Commission, tasked with the enforcement of data protection law, to make assessments as to what will or will not make the performance of a contract possible or impossible. Instead, the general principles set out in the GDPR and explained by the EDPB in the Guidance must be applied. These principles must be applied on a case-by-case basis. While the examples provided in the EDPB Guidance are helpful and instructive, they are not conclusive of the position in any specific case and indeed do not purport to be. \n\n4.49 Even if, contrary to my view, the appropriate standard in assessing Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was one of impossibility rather than necessity _simpliciter_, Facebook has submitted that “…_it would be impossible to provide the Facebook service in accordance with the Terms of Service without providing personalised advertising_”.[[78]](#_ftn78)  While it does not consider that this would be the correct interpretation of the law, it considers that this standard would nonetheless be met under the Terms of Service.\n\n4.50 While I remain of the view that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that, unless it is impossible to perform the contract without particular acts or operations of data processing, such processing is not necessary for the performance of the contract, this argument underlines the extent to which targeted advertising forms a core part of the contract between Facebook and its user.\n\n4.51 Based on the above considerations, I proposed to conclude, in the Draft Decision, that neither Article 6(1)(b) nor any other provision of the GPDR precluded Facebook from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to for the delivery of a service based on behavioural advertising of the kind provided for under the contract between Facebook and its users at issue in this Complaint. As discussed below, I further expressed the view that other provisions of the GDPR (such as transparency, which I consider at Issue 3) act to strictly regulate the manner in which this service is to be delivered, and the information that should be given to users. \n\n4.52 Having analysed the submissions of the parties, the terms of the GDPR, and the jurisprudence and EDPB Guidelines, I proposed, by way of the Draft Decision, to find that there was no basis for the contention that Facebook is precluded in principle from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purposes of legitimising the personal data processing activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service.\n\nThere is nothing in the GDPR that restricts or prohibits the use of these terms in the context of processing personal data _per se_. As has been set out earlier, and as set out by the Investigator, it is not for the Commission to rule on matters of contract law and contractual interpretation that extend beyond the remit of data protection law. The lawful basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR simply states that personal data may be processed where it is necessary for the performance of a contract. In other words and, as I have already set out in analysis, the data may be processed if, without such processing, the contract could not be performed. I am not convinced, for the reasons set out, that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR goes a step further and excludes all processing unless the fulfilment of some abstractly discerned purpose would be rendered impossible without that processing. I also expressed the view, in the Draft Decision, that this application conforms broadly to significant elements of the interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR proposed by the Complainant and by the EDPB.\n\n4.53 While I accepted that, as a general rule, the EPDB considers that processing for online behavioural advertising would not be necessary for the performance of a contract for online services, in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, I proposed to conclude that Facebook may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users. \n\n4.54 Having regard to the scope of the Complaint and this Inquiry, as described above, I added that this proposed conclusion was not to be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on users’ personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n\n4.55 Following the circulation of the Commission’s Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned, for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections to this aspect of matters were raised by the supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.  Having considered the merits of those objections, the EDPB determined as follows:\n\n94.           The EDPB considers it necessary to begin its assessment on the merits with a general description of the practice of behavioural advertising carried out in the context of the Facebook service before determining whether the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is appropriate for this practice in the present case, based on the Facebook Terms of Service and the nature of its products and features as described in those terms. The requests for preliminary rulings made to the CJEU in the cases C- 252/21[[79]](#_ftn79) and C-446/21[[80]](#_ftn80) to which some of the documents in the file refer[[81]](#_ftn81) contain helpful descriptions of Meta IE’s behavioural advertising practices in the context of its Facebook service.\n\n95.           These requests for preliminary rulings mention that Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook social network service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device. According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way.\n\n96.           The EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service. These are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and expect behavioural advertising when they accept the Facebook Terms of Service and perceive it as necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service[[82]](#_ftn82). Accordingly, the EDPB further considers that the IE SA could have added to its Draft Decision a description of behavioural advertising that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service to appropriately substantiate its reasoning leading to its acceptance of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for that practice in accordance with the IE SA’s duty to state the reasons for an individual decision[[83]](#_ftn83).\n\n97.           In the same vein, the EDPB also finds that the content of the Gallup Institute poll, which the Complainant’s representative requested and subsequently submitted to the IE SA in its submission of 20 November 2019, could have been part of the facts of the Draft Decision[[84]](#_ftn84). This poll provides a supplementary and useful indication on the perspective of Facebook users, which helps assessing whether they could expect being subject to behavioural advertising as part of a contract. The results of the poll allege, inter alia, that only 1.6% to 2.5% of the 1.000 respondents[[85]](#_ftn85), who are Facebook users, understood the request to accept the Facebook Terms of Service to be a _“contract”_ that provides them with a contractual right to personalised advertisement. The IE SA acknowledges the Complainant’s submission of this poll in its Draft Decision but seemingly dismisses it by focusing primarily on what it considers as primary sources of factual evidence (primarily, the Facebook Terms of Service) and _“matters in the public domain”[**[86]**](#_ftn86)_. Conversely, Meta IE seems to attach importance to this poll. Meta IE engaged an expert to produce a report (the “Vanhuele Report”) that Meta IE appends to Annex 2 of its pre-Article 65 submission to point to what Meta IE considers _“serious flaws”_ in the report containing the poll and allege that the Complainant misinterpreted its results[[87]](#_ftn87).\n\n…\n\n101.   The GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the TFEU, which constitute EU primary law[[88]](#_ftn88). As the CJEU clarified_, “an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law”[**[89]**](#_ftn89)_. In the face of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and sharing, the GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control of their own personal data99. By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection throughout the EU, the GDPR seeks to ensure the free movement of personal data within the EU[[90]](#_ftn90). The GDPR acknowledges that the right to data protection needs to be balanced against other fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to conduct a business, in accordance with the principle of proportionality101 and has these considerations integrated into its provisions. The GDPR, pursuant to EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to a data subject and his/her dignity, and not as a commodity data subjects can trade away through a contract[[91]](#_ftn91). The CJEU provided additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests[[92]](#_ftn92).\n\n102.   The principle of lawfulness of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to the protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process the personal data of individuals if it is able to rely on one of the basis found in the exhaustive and restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR[[93]](#_ftn93).\n\n103.   The principle of lawfulness goes hand in hand with the principles of fairness and transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller[[94]](#_ftn94).\n\n104.   The EDPB agrees with the IE SA and Meta IE that there is no hierarchy between these legal bases[[95]](#_ftn95). However, this does not mean that a controller, as Meta IE in the present case, has absolute discretion to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller may only rely on one of the legal basis established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the processing at stake[[96]](#_ftn96). A specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet its requirements set by the GDPR[[97]](#_ftn97) and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. The legal basis will not be appropriate if its application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect _“effet utile”_ pursued by the GDPR and its Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR[[98]](#_ftn98). These criteria stem from the content of the GDPR110 and the interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given thereto described in paragraph 101 above.\n\n105.   The GDPR makes Meta IE, as a data controller for the processing at stake, directly responsible for complying with the Regulation’s principles, including the processing of data in a lawful, fair and transparent manner, and any obligations derived therefrom[[99]](#_ftn99). This obligation applies even where the practical application of GDPR principles such as those of Article 5(1)(a) and Article (5)(2) GDPR is inconvenient or runs counter to the commercial interests of Meta IE and its business model. The controller is also obliged to be able to demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations derived therefrom, such as that it meets the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis[[100]](#_ftn100).\n\n106.   The first condition to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process the data subject’s data is that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, has to be able to **demonstrate that (a) a contract exists and (b) the contract is valid** pursuant to applicable national contract laws[[101]](#_ftn101).\n\n107.   Both the IE SA and Meta IE consider that the Facebook Terms of Service make up the entire agreement between the Facebook user and Meta IE and that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document setting out information to fulfil the GDPR transparency obligations[[102]](#_ftn102). The IE SA thus considers that the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) must take place, is the Facebook Terms of Service only[[103]](#_ftn103).\n\n108.   The IE SA and Meta IE argue that the GDPR does not confer a broad and direct competence to supervisory authorities to interpret or assess the validity of contracts[[104]](#_ftn104). In its Draft Decision, the IE SA noted that the Complainant explicitly sought to have it investigate and make findings in respect of contract and consumer law. The IE SA noted that this falls outside of the remit of a supervisory authority under the GDPR and are instead within the competence of the relevant consumer and competition authorities117.\n\n109.   The EDPB agrees that SAs do not have under the GDPR a broad and general competence in contractual matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks that the GDPR bestows on SAs imply a limited competence to assess a contract’s general validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment of their tasks under the GDPR. Otherwise, the SAs would see their monitoring and enforcement task under Article 57(1)(a) GDPR limited to actions such as verifying whether the processing at stake is necessary for the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a processor under Article 28(3) GDPR and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate safeguards pursuant to the GDPR.\n\nPursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation, the SAs would thus be obliged to always consider a contract valid, even in situations where it is manifestly evident that it is not, for instance because there is no proof of agreement between the two parties, or because the contract does not comply with its Member State’s rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child[[105]](#_ftn105).\n\n110.   As the DE and NL SAs[[106]](#_ftn106) argue, the validity of the contract for the Facebook service between Meta IE and the Complainant is questionable given the strong indications that the Complainant was unaware of entering into a contract, and (as the IE SA establishes with its Finding 3 of its Draft Decision) serious transparency issues in relation to the legal basis relied on. In contract law, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of the contract and the obligations of both parties to the contract in order to willingly enter into such contract.\n\n111.   Notwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB refers to its previous interpretative guidance on this matter[[107]](#_ftn107) to provide below its **analysis on whether behavioural advertising is objectively necessary** for Meta IE to provide its Facebook service to the user based on its Facebook Terms of Service and the nature of the service.\n\n112.   The EDPB recalls[[108]](#_ftn108) that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “_[i]t is important to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance_”[[109]](#_ftn109). As the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject[[110]](#_ftn110).\n\n113.   Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract124.\n\n114.   The IE SA accepts the EDPB’s position[[111]](#_ftn111) that, as a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services126. However, the IE SA considers that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the Facebook service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users.\n\n115.   The IE SA views behavioural advertising as a _“core”_, _“fundamental”_ and _“commercially essential”_ element of the contract and the commercial transaction between Meta IE and the Facebook users[[112]](#_ftn112). In support of this consideration, the IE SA refers to the information provided in the Facebook Terms of Service under the headings: “_Provide a personalized experience for you”_ and “_Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you”[**[113]**](#_ftn113)_. The information provided includes reference to ads and includes the statement that _“[w]e use the data we have … to personalize your experience”_. The IE SA further notes that the nature of the service being offered to Facebook users is set out in the first line of the Facebook Terms of Service,[[114]](#_ftn114) which reads textually: _“Provide a personalized experience for you:”_. The IE SA considers that it is clear that the Facebook service is advertised (and widely understood) as one funded by personalised advertising and so, that any reasonable user would expect and understand and that this was the _“bargain being struck, even if they_ [the users] _might prefer that the market would offer them better alternative choices”130_.\n\n116.   On this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under EU law. It must be interpreted in a manner that fully reflects the objective pursued by an EU instrument, in this case, the GDPR[[115]](#_ftn115). Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision and the GDPR’s general objective of protecting the right to the protection of personal data[[116]](#_ftn116) or contradicts Article 8 of the Charter. On the processing of data in the Facebook service, Advocate General Rantos supports a strict interpretation of the Article 6(1)(b) GDPR among other legal basis, particularly to avoid any circumvention of the requirement for consent[[117]](#_ftn117).\n\n117.   Meta IE promotes among its prospective and current users the perception that the main purpose the Facebook service serves and for which it processes its users’ data is to enable them to communicate with others. Meta IE presents its Facebook service in its landing website as a platform enabling users to _“connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook”_ and at the beginning of its Facebook Terms of Service[[118]](#_ftn118) as being its mission _“to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:_ (...)” which include in consecutive headings _“Connect you with people and organizations you care about: (...)”_; _“Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you: (...)” and “Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you: (...)”_.\n\n118.  The fact that the Facebook Terms of Service[[119]](#_ftn119) do not provide for any contractual obligation binding Meta IE to offer personalised advertising to the Facebook users and any contractual penalty if Meta IE fails to do so shows that, at least from the perspective of the Facebook user, this processing is not necessary to perform the contract. Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation between Meta IE and the specific advertisers that pay for Meta IE’s targeted display of their advertisements in the Facebook service to Facebook users, but it is not presented as an obligation towards the Facebook users.\n\n119.  Nor does Meta IE’s business model of offering services, at no monetary cost for the user to generate income by behavioural advertisement to support its Facebook service, among others, make this processing necessary to perform the contract. Under the principle of lawfulness of the GDPR and its Article 6, it is the business model which must adapt itself and comply with the requirements that the GDPR sets out in general and for each of the legal bases and not the reverse. As the Advocate General Rantos stressed recently in his opinion on Meta IE’s processing in Facebook, based on Article 5(2) GDPR, it is the controller (Meta IE in this case) who is responsible for demonstrating that the personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR[[120]](#_ftn120).\n\n120.  As the EDPB provided in its guidance[[121]](#_ftn121) assessing what is “_necessary_” involves a combined, fact-based assessment of the processing “_for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared to other options for achieving the same goal”_. If there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not “_necessary_”. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR will not cover processing that is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service or for taking relevant pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes.\n\n121.   On the question of whether here there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives to behavioural advertising that make this processing not “_necessary_”[[122]](#_ftn122), the EDPB considers that there are. The AT, PL and SE SAs mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, which do not involve intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users[[123]](#_ftn123). In his recent opinion on Facebook, Advocate General Rantos also refers to the Austrian Government’s _“pertinent”_ observation that in the past, Meta IE allowed Facebook users to choose between a chronological presentation and a personalised presentation of newsfeed content, which, in his view, proves that an alternative method is possible[[124]](#_ftn124). By considering the existence of alternative practices to behavioural advertising that are more respectful of the Facebook users’ right to data protection, the EDPB, as the Advocate General, aims to assess if this processing is objectively necessary to deliver the service offered, as perceived by the Facebook user whose personal data is processed, and not to dictate the nature of Meta IE’s service or impose specific business models on controllers, as Meta IE and the IE SA respectively argue[[125]](#_ftn125). The EDPB considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes[[126]](#_ftn126).\n\n122.   The EDPB considers that the absolute right available to data subjects, under Article 21(2)(3) GDPR to object to the processing of their data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes further supports its consideration that, as a general rule, the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary to perform a contract. The processing cannot be necessary to perform a contract if a subject has the possibility to opt out from it at any time, and without providing any reason.\n\n123.   The EDPB finds that a reasonable user cannot expect that their personal data is being processed for behavioural advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to this processing in the Facebook Terms of Service (which Meta IE and the IE SA consider as constituting the entirety of the contract), or because of the _“wider circumstances”_ or _“recognised public awareness of behavioural advertising”_ derived from its _“widespread prevalence”_ to which the IE SA refers143. Behavioural advertising, as briefly described in paragraph 95 above, is a set of processing operations of personal data of great technical complexity, which has a particularly massive and intrusive nature. In view of the characteristics of behavioural advertising, coupled with the very brief and insufficient information that Meta provides about it in the Facebook Terms of Service and Data Policy (a separate document that the IE SA and Meta IE do not even consider part of the contractual obligations), the EDPB finds it extremely difficult to argue that an average user can fully grasp it, be aware of its consequences and impact on their rights to privacy and data protection, and reasonably expect it solely based on the Facebook Terms of Service. The EDPB recalls its Guidelines 2/2019 in which it argues that the expectations of the average data subject need to be consider in light, not only of the terms of service but also the way this service is promoted to users[[127]](#_ftn127). Advocate General Rantos expresses similar doubts where he says in relation to Facebook behavioural advertising practices _“I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for”[**[128]**](#_ftn128)_ and adds in a footnote that he does not “_believe that the collection and use of personal data outside Facebook are necessary for the provision of the services offered as part of the Facebook profile”[**[129]**](#_ftn129)._\n\n124.   Based on the considerations above, the EDPB considers that the main purpose for which users use Facebook and accept the Facebook Terms of Service is to communicate with others, not to receive personalised advertisements.\n\n125.   Meta   IE   infringed   its   transparency   obligations   under   Article 5(1)(a),   Article 12(1)  and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR by not clearly informing the Complainant and other users of the Facebook service’s specific processing operations, the personal data processed in them, the specific purpose they serve, and the legal basis on which each of the processing operations relies, as the IE SA concludes in its Draft Decision[[130]](#_ftn130). The EDPB considers that this fundamental failure of Meta IE to comply with its transparency obligations contradicts the IE SA’s finding[[131]](#_ftn131) that Facebook users could reasonably expect online behavioural advertising as being necessary for the performance of their contract (as described in the Facebook Terms of Service) with Meta IE.\n\n126.   The EDPB recalls that “_controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis  is_”  and  that  this  is  “_particularly  relevant  where  the  appropriate  legal  basis  is  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects_”, because “_[d]epending on the circumstances, data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR when signing a contract or accepting terms of service”[**[132]**](#_ftn132). Article 6(1)(b) GDPR requires the existence, validity of a contract, and the processing being necessary to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the Parties (in this case the data subject) is not provided with sufficient information to know that they are signing a contract, the processing of personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes and on which legal basis, and how this processing is necessary to perform the services delivered. These transparency requirements are not only an additional and separate obligation, as the IE SA seems to imply[**[133]**](#_ftn133), but also an indispensable and constitutive part of the legal basis._\n\n127.   The risks to the rights of data subjects derived from this asymmetry of information and an inappropriate reliance on this legal basis are higher in situations such as in the present case, in which the Complainant and other Facebook users face a “_take it or leave it”_ situation resulting from the standard contract pre-formulated by Meta IE and the lack of few alternative services in the market. The EU legislator has regularly identified and aimed to address with multiple legal instruments these risks and the imbalance between the parties to consumer contracts. For example, Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts[[134]](#_ftn134) mandates, as the transparency obligations under the GDPR, the use of plain, intelligible language in the terms of the contracts offered to consumers[[135]](#_ftn135). This Directive even provides that where there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail[[136]](#_ftn136). Processing of personal data that is based on what is deemed to be an unfair term under this Directive will generally not be consistent with the requirement under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that the processing is lawful and fair[[137]](#_ftn137).\n\n128.   Advocate General Rantos concludes in reference to Meta IE that the fact that an undertaking providing a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social networks for private users “_does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it”[**[138]**](#_ftn138)._ In line with the logic of this argument, the EDPB considers that the dominant position of Facebook also plays an important role in the assessment of Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for its Facebook service and its risks to data subjects, especially considering how deficiently Meta IE informs the Facebook users of the data it strictly needs to process to deliver the service.\n\n129.   Given that the main purpose for which a user uses the Facebook service is to communicate with others156, and that Meta IE conditions its use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the behavioural advertising it includes, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue[[139]](#_ftn139). The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 7 GDPR and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.\n\n130.   The EDPB agrees with the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT, and SE SAs[[140]](#_ftn140) that there is a risk that the Draft Decision’s failure to establish Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation of it, nullifies this provision and makes lawful theoretically any collection and reuse of personal data in connection with the performance of a contract with a data subject. Meta IE currently leaves the Complainant and other users of the Facebook service with a single choice. They may either contract away their right to freely determine the processing of their personal data and submit to its processing for the obscure and intrusive purpose of behavioural advertising, which they can neither expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information Meta IE provides to them. Or, they may decline accepting the Facebook Terms of Service and thus be excluded from a service that enables them to communicate with millions of users and for which there are currently few realistic alternatives. This exclusion would thus also adversely affect their freedom of expression and information.\n\n131.   This precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There would be the risk that some controllers argue some connection between the processing of the personal data of their consumers and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as possible and advance their economic interests at the expense of the safeguards for data subjects. Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis, instead of others such as consent 6(1)(a) GDPR and legitimate interest 6(1)(f) GDPR, are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). As a result, owing to the number of users, market power, and influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive business model, the risks derived from the current findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the Complainant and the millions of users of Facebook service in the EEA and affect the protection of the hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR.\n\n132.   The EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE\n\nSAs[[141]](#_ftn141) to Finding 2 of the Draft Decision in that the behavioural advertising performed by Meta\n\nIE in the context of the Facebook service is objectively not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s alleged contract with data users for the Facebook service and is not an essential or core element of it.\n\n133.   In conclusion, the EDPB decides that Meta IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service and therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data for the purpose of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has not relied on any other legal basis to process personal data in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service for the purpose of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has consequently infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing personal data. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service, and to include an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified.\n\n4.56 On the basis of the above, and as directed by the EDPB further to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Facebook was not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service.\n\n**Finding 2: I find that Facebook was not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service.**\n\n### 5 ISSUE 3 – WHETHER FACEBOOK PROVIDED THE REQUISITE INFORMATION ON THE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING ON FOOT OF ARTICLE 6(1)(B) GDPR AND WHETHER IT DID SO IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER\n\n5.1 Processing of personal data, including transparency requirements of the GDPR, are governed by the overarching principles set out in Article 5 GDPR, which provides that:\n\n“_1. Personal data shall be:_\n\n_(a)_                _processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);_\n\n_(b)_                _collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed In a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);_\n\n_(c)_                 _adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);_\n\n_(d)_                _accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);_\n\n_(e)_                 _kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);_\n\n_(f)_                  _processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’)._\n\n_2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’)._”\n\n5.2   Recital 58 of the GDPR, which serves as an aid to interpretation, states:\n\n“_The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used._\n\n_Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website._\n\n_This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising._\n\n_Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand._”\n\n5.3 Article 12(1) GDPR provides for the general manner in which information required by the transparency provisions of the GDPR should be set out:\n\n“_The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other means._”\n\n5.4 Article 13 GDPR enumerates specific categories of information that must be provided to data subjects by data controllers in order to comply with transparency obligations:\n\n“_1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data_ _subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:_\n\n_(a)_  _the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller’s representative;_\n\n_(b)_  _the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;_\n\n_(c)_   _the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;_\n\n_(d)_  _where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;_\n\n_(e)_  _the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;_\n\n_(f)_    _where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available._\n\n_2._                   _In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:_\n\n_(a)_  _the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;_\n\n_(b)_  _the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;_\n\n_(c)_   _where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;_\n\n_(d)_  _the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;_\n\n_(e)_  _whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;_\n\n_(f)_    _the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject._\n\n_3._                   _Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2._\n\n_4._                   _Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information._”\n\n5.5               In its Transparency Guidelines, which have been adopted by the EDPB, the Article 29 Working Party found that:\n\n“_A central consideration of the principle of transparency outlined in these provisions is that the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences of the processing entails and that they should not be taken by surprise at a later point about the ways in which their personal data has been used._”[[142]](#_ftn142)\n\n5.6               In the Complaint, the Complainant alleges that Facebook’s updated Terms of Service and the hyperlinked Data Policy, together with the mode of acceptance (namely, clicking an “accept” button) of the Terms of Service, created the conditions which led to the belief “_that all these processing operations_” were based on consent under 6(1)(a) GDPR.[[143]](#_ftn143) The Investigator therefore examined whether it could be alleged that the Complainant was led to believe this was the case.\n\n5.7               The Complainant argues that there was a lack of clarity in respect of the data processing which was carried out on foot of the alleged “forced consent” to the Terms of Service. Indeed, the Complaint states that “[e]_ven if a trained lawyer reads all the text that the controller provides, he/she can only guess what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis. This is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c)._”[[144]](#_ftn144) Furthermore, the Complainant argues that:\n\n“_The controller has in fact relied on a number of legal grounds under Article 6(1) of the GDPR, but has given the data subject the impression, that he solely relies on consent, by requesting the data subject to agree to the privacy policy (see above). Asking for consent to a processing operation, when the controller relies in fact on another legal basis is fundamentally unfair, misleading and non-transparent within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR_.”\n\n5.8               The Complainant asserts that the clicking of “accept” on the Terms of Service generated the belief that the processing was based on consent. In my view, this is surprising, given the common nature of such “click wrap” contractual agreements utilised by most, if not all, online platforms. Nonetheless, the Complainant outlined and provided the Commission with an affidavit (sworn statement) sworn by the data subject, which stated that the “overall impression” created by the “accept” button was that the data subject was providing their consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. It is stated that the data subject did not read the Legal Basis Information Page prior to agreeing to the Terms of Service. The Complainant raised a number of other additional points relating to the engagement flow, including its design, which according to the Complainant was intended to cause “user fatigue” and also an alleged difficulty in navigating to the Legal Basis Information Page.\n\n5.9               In this way, inherent in this Complaint is the argument that the legal basis relied on by Facebook for processing personal data in accordance with the acceptance of the Terms of Service is unclear.\n\nArticle 5(1)(a) GDPR sets out the requirement that, at a general level, personal data must be processed in a transparent manner. More specific transparency requirements are contained in Articles 12 and 13 GDPR. In particular, Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires that “_the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for processing_” must be made clear to a user. Article 12(1) GDPR sets out that this information required by Article 13 GDPR must be provided in a clear and transparent manner. Article 13 GDPR therefore prescribes the information which must be provided to the data subject whereas Article 12(1) GDPR sets out the way in which this information should be provided. \n\n5.10           Given the Complaint’s focus on the alleged “forced consent” and on processing carried out on foot of the acceptance of the Terms of Service, I confined the transparency analysis in the Preliminary Draft Decision to questions relating to information on the lawful basis for processing data arising from that acceptance. It follows that, as well as Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, Article 13(1)(c) GPDR must be considered, as well as the accompanying requirement that the information required by that latter provision be set out in accordance with Article 12(1) GDPR. As I have already found that, to the extent specific processing operations are complained of, Facebook sought to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the central focus of this Decision in respect of this issue is compliance with Article 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of that lawful basis.\n\n5.11           In its submissions on the Draft Report, the Complainant further detailed her objections in relation to transparency by arguing that “_there is also no clear statement which data are processed for which purposes under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR_”,[[145]](#_ftn145) and that “[t]_he only document Facebook puts forward to prove the complainant's alleged information about the alleged change of legal basis is the hard-to-find sub-sub-page on \"legal basis\", which is anything but an easily accessible form_”.164\n\n## THE “LAYERED” APPROACH\n\n5.12 I have already set out the reasons for my disagreement with the Investigator’s use of a distinction between the question of whether the data subject was misled and the broader question of whether the Data Policy complies with the transparency provisions of the GDPR. The obligation for a controller to comply with these transparency provisions constitutes, in and of themselves, the entirety of the Complainant’s right not to be misled under the GDPR.\n\n5.13 When the Investigator considered compliance with the transparency requirements in this context, he adopted a “layered” approach. That is to say, each “layer” of the documents in question were assessed in isolation for their individual compliance before a final “cumulative” view was expressed. Facebook disagreed with this approach, arguing that “[t]_he GDPR contains no such_\n\n_concept of distinct layers and does not require a layered approach. Controllers are obliged to take appropriate measures to provide information to data subjects and are permitted to achieve this in ways they consider appropriate_”.[[146]](#_ftn146)\n\n5.14                The Investigator disagreed with Facebook’s submissions, and expressed the view that:\n\n“_in order to assess the layered provision of information, it is first necessary to consider the discrete information sources separately, in order to arrive at an overall view. Accordingly, the following assessment of primary, secondary and tertiary sources of information provided by Facebook is not premised on “separatist approach”, rather, it constitutes a comprehensive assessment of the manner in which information has been provided to the data subject. The investigator also considers that, where a controller adopts a layered approach to the provision of information, each layer must comply independently with the requirement of Article 12(1) GDPR regarding the provision of information_”.166\n\n5.15 I respectfully disagree with the premise of the Investigator’s reasons for adopting this approach. Article 12(1) GDPR is directed to ensuring, insofar as possible, that the data subject receives the information that is “provided” by the data controller. It does this by reference to the potential barriers that could operate to prevent the information from being received by the data subject. The requirement, for example, for the data controller to use “clear and plain language” when “providing” the information helps to ensure that the data subject is not hindered in receiving the information because of an inability to understand complicated or technical jargon. Similarly, the requirement for the data controller to “provide” the information in a “concise” manner helps to ensure that the data subject is not hindered in receiving the information as a result of information fatigue caused by the incorporation of the information into a long and rambling piece of text.\n\n5.16 Article 12(1) GDPR, however, clearly deals with “_any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34_” [my emphasis]. Therefore, compliance with this provision can only be assessed by reference to the provision of information mandated by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR as appropriate; it is not a requirement applied generally to every single piece of information provided to the data subject concerning data processing. There is no requirement that the information mandated by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR be contained in any particular “layer” of information; there is simply a requirement that the information be provided, and that the information be set out in the manner required by Article 12(1) GDPR. Therefore, each individual “layer” cannot be assessed by reference to Article 12(1) GDPR independently of the information required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR.\n\n5.17 Given that a controller is free to choose not to put particular information in a particular layer, it must follow that Article 12(1) GDPR cannot be used as a basis for assessing each layer independently. It may well be the case that something about the “layered” approach taken by a controller could ultimately mean the information required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR is not set out in the manner required by Article 12(1) GDPR. That in itself, however, is not a justification for an isolated and/or abstract assessment of each individual layer, without reference to other layers, for compliance with Article 12(1) GDPR. On that basis, while the Investigator’s view on the issue of infringements was expressed by reference to each individual layer before finally arriving at a separate view in relation to the documents as a whole, I propose to approach the assessment strictly by reference to the requirements of Articles 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR. Once the information has been provided and has been provided in a compliant manner, it does not matter whether a controller has achieved the objective by the use of layering, nor does it matter what precisely is contained in each layer.\n\n5.18 For the avoidance of doubt, I am not expressing any particular view on the merits or otherwise of controllers adopting a layered approach. Moreover, I am conscious that a layered approach for the provision of information on online services has been explicitly endorsed by the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines (and, in turn, endorsed by the EDPB).[[147]](#_ftn147) I am instead expressing a view on the appropriate manner in which to assess the compliance of any such layered information with Articles 12 and 13 GDPR. In my view, while the Investigator’s analysis was robust and comprehensive, the consideration of the documents was not sufficiently holistic, insofar as individual layers were initially assessed for compliance without reference to the information or documents as a whole.\n\n5.19 In addition, I should add that a cumulative assessment of the information provided and the manner in which the information is provided must always be carried out, irrespective of whether the Investigator was correct to also assess each layer individually, or whether Facebook was correct to argue that the individual layers should not be considered in this manner. In circumstances where the layered documents, when considered cumulatively, lack the information required by Article 13 GDPR or are not set out in a manner compliant with Article 12 GDPR, it matters not whether any individual layer is deficient or otherwise; there would still be an infringement of the provision.\n\n5.20 The Investigator was of the general view that the “Legal Basis Information Page” (a term used by the Investigator for an unnamed page linked to the Data Policy and Terms of Service) is transparent about Facebook’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and that therefore it was transparent that data would be processed on that basis arising out of acceptance of the Terms of Service.[[148]](#_ftn148) The Investigator went on to express a number of views to the effect that Articles 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR were being infringed on the basis that each “layer” of information failed to set\n\nout specific processing operations (or sets of operations), their individual purpose, and the lawful basis being relied on for each. Facebook’s position is that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR “_does not require a controller to provide this information in relation to specific processing operations, rather, it requires transparency in relation to the processing purposes._”[[149]](#_ftn149) Facebook further argues that the definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) GDPR, i.e. an “operation or sets of operations”, cannot be used to circumvent, what they say is, the clear intention of the legislator to use the term “processing” instead of “processing operations”, when the latter appears in the text of the GDPR over fifty times.[[150]](#_ftn150) I consider this argument in more detail below.\n\n5.21 Many of the points of dispute that characterise the submissions of Facebook on the Draft Report and the contents of the Final Report relate to the dispute as to the appropriateness of assessing compliance with reference to each individual “layer” of information. I have set out my view in that regard already. I also note that, in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, Facebook expressed agreement with this conclusion, and maintained that the relevant consideration “_is whether, cumulatively, the data subject has been provided with the information required under the GDPR._”[[151]](#_ftn151) Therefore I will now proceed to consider whether, in my view, Facebook has been transparent with the Complainant (and therefore with data subjects in general) in relation to processing for which it indicated reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. I will make further reference to the Reports and the submissions of the parties when considering that issue.\n\n## THE EXTENT OF THE OBLIGATION IN ARTICLE 13(1)(C) GDPR\n\n5.22 In the Investigator’s view, Article 13(1)(c) requires a data controller to set out a description of the processing operation or sets of operations undertaken by the controller to fulfil that purpose, and the legal basis relied on by the controller in order to carry out that processing operation or sets of operations. His view is that “_the obligation under Article 13(1)(c) requires the provision of two types of information to the data subject: (i) information which specifies the lawful basis for processing, and (ii) information which describes the processing associated with that lawful basis_”.[[152]](#_ftn152) Facebook’s view on the matter is that there is no such specific obligation for “_the legal basis being mapped to the purpose of processing_”.[[153]](#_ftn153) Facebook argues that the legal bases and purposes can be set out in a manner that does not necessarily link one to the other.\n\n5.23      Article 4(2) GDPR, which deals with interpretation, states that:\n\n“_’processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction._” [emphasis added]\n\n5.24 I also note that Recital 60 states that “_principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes_”. The Article 29 Working Party has opined that:\n\n“_Transparency is intrinsically linked to fairness and the new principle of accountability under the GDPR. It also follows from Article 5.2 that the controller must always be able to demonstrate that personal data are processed in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. Connected to this, the accountability principle requires transparency of processing operations in order that data controllers are able to demonstrate compliance with their obligations under the GDPR._”[[154]](#_ftn154)\n\n5.25 Facebook has sought to argue that the absence of a specific reference to processing “operation” in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR means that the obligation to provide information to data subjects does not necessitate an approach whereby the prescribed information is provided by reference to individual processing operation(s). In the Preliminary Draft Decision, I did not agree with this position. The Preliminary Draft Decision set out that Article 4(2) GDPR clearly identifies that the definitions set out in that provision are “for the purposes of” the GDPR and that there is no limitation on the application of the prescribed definitions, either within Article 4 GDPR or in the context of other individual provisions of the Regulation. For this reason, the Preliminary Draft Decision expressed the view that an argument premised on a suggestion that the definition of “processing” should only be applied to those provisions that incorporate specific reference, within its own text, to an “operation” or “operations”, was legally unsustainable based on a literal interpretation of the GDPR.\n\n5.26 I note that the Investigator agreed with Facebook’s argument that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires a data controller to provide information in relation to the purpose(s) of the processing in conjunction with the corresponding legal basis for processing. However, the phrase “_for which the personal data were intended_”, suggests that the data controller should also provide this information in such a way that enables the data subject to understand which personal data are/will be processed, for what processing operation and by reference to which legal basis, at least in broad terms. \n\n5.27 In expressing disagreement with the proposed literal interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision, Facebook submitted that “_Facebook Ireland’s interpretation_\n\n_directly tracks the actual wording of the relevant GDPR provision which stipulates only that two items of information be provided about the processing (i.e. purposes and legal bases). It says nothing about processing operations._”[[155]](#_ftn155) Facebook submitted that because, in its view, Article 13(1) GDPR applies “_at the time data is collected_”, it therefore refers only to “_prospective processing_”. It submits that, on this basis, Article 13(1)(c) GDPR does not relate to ongoing processing operations, but is concerned solely with information on “_intended processing_”.[[156]](#_ftn156) Facebook’s position is therefore that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR is future-gazing or prospective only in its application and that such an interpretation is supported by a literal reading of the GDPR.\n\n5.28 Facebook argues that, despite the provision of a clear definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) GDPR, Article 13(1)(c) GDPR sets out: \n\n“_only two specific features of the processing that need to be provided_. _Article 13(1)(c) GDPR does not require disclosure, for example, of various other aspects of processing referenced in Article 4(2) GDPR, namely, the intended nature of the processing, or the intended form in which the data will be processed, or the intended duration of the processing, which is separately required and addressed by Article 13(2)(a) GDPR. Similarly, another aspect of processing – namely, the identity of any recipient – is explicitly included under Article 13(1)(e) GDPR, but the same is not done as regards the specifying of processing operations. As such, the generic definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) GDPR is not relevant to the analysis of what Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires._”177\n\n5.29 Facebook’s argument above is premised on the suggestion that the various provisions of Article 13 GDPR require the disclosure to data subjects of specific aspects of the broader activity or “processing” as defined by Article 4(2) GDPR, such as the identity of a recipient, the duration of the processing, etc. Facebook makes the point that nothing in Article 13 requires it to specify if storage, transmission or dissemination, for example, are the _forms_ of processing engaged. That is correct. However, what Article 13 does clearly require is that the purposes and legal bases must be specified in respect of the _intended processing_. Purposes and legal bases cannot simply be cited in the abstract and detached from the personal data processing they concern.  \n\n5.30 As Facebook’s position cannot be reconciled with a literal reading of the GDPR, for completeness, it is necessary to consider whether its position is nonetheless justified by a systemic reading based on the legislator’s objective and the contents of the GDPR as a whole. Firstly in relation to the argument I have just dealt with, it is important to note that transparency, both under the GDPR and in the Guidelines that are to be considered in this Decision, are directly linked to the principle of accountability under the GDPR. In order to ensure that actual or intended processing is carried out in an accountable and transparent manner, the interpretation proposed by Facebook cannot\n\nbe accepted. Firstly, the absence of any level of specificity as to what the data controller is doing with the data, and more fundamentally what data they are processing at all, would render information on the purposes of this unspecified processing almost useless to a data subject. In the absence of information on the nature of the data being used and the nature of the processing being carried out, it would be nigh on impossible to exercise data subject rights in an informed manner. Such an absence of transparency and accountability could not be reconciled with a purposive or systematic reading of the GDPR.  \n\n5.31 Facebook goes on to provide examples of previous drafts of the GDPR where the legislator considered requiring additional material in Article 13 GDPR, including “_the existence of certain processing activities and operations for which a personal data impact assessment has indicated that there may be a high risk_”.[[157]](#_ftn157) The decision of the legislator not to include a requirement to provide such information has no impact on the applicability of the clear definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) GDPR, and therefore does not affect the appropriate literal interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. In any purposive or systematic approach to interpreting the provision, the decision not to require information on processing which the controller itself has found to be high risk does not suggest that the controller would not otherwise be required to disclose the existence of that processing. It would simply require a controller to disclose that a data protection impact assessment indicated the presence of a high risk. This therefore provides no evidence that the legislator excluded in any way the interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR being proposed.\n\n5.32 Article 5(1)(b) GDPR states that personal data shall be “_collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes_”, and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR states that the data shall be “_limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed_” [emphasis added]. The core principles clearly focus quite closely on the purposes for processing (defined, by Article 4(11) GDPR, as “processing operations or sets of operations). While Article 5 GDPR lays down six different principles, those principles are interconnected and operate, in combination, to underpin the GDPR as a whole.\n\n5.33 Considering the purpose limitation principle, I note that this principle identifies the obligations which arise by reference to the terms “collection” and “further” processing. This is very similar to the language of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, as the introductory passage to Article 13 GDPR contains a reference to “collection”, and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR itself refers to “_the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended_”. It therefore can be said that Article 13 GDPR also considers “collection” and “further” processing. For this reason, it is useful to examine further the requirements and function of the purpose limitation principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.\n\n5.34      The Article 29 Working Party has provided Guidance that states:\n\n“_When setting out the requirement of compatibility, the Directive does not specifically refer to processing for the ‘originally specified purposes’ and processing for ‘purposes defined subsequently’. Rather, it differentiates between the very first processing operation, which is collection, and all other subsequent processing operations (including for instance the very first typical processing operation following collection – the storage of data)._\n\n_In other words: any processing following collection, whether for the purposes initially specified or for any additional purposes, must be considered ‘further processing’ and must thus meet the requirement of compatibility_”\n\n5.35 This introduces a distinction between “purpose specification” and “compatible use”. In relation to specifying the purpose for which data is collected, the Article 29 Working Party stated that:\n\n“[P]_ersonal data should only be collected for ‘specified, explicit and legitimate’ purposes. Data are collected for certain aims; these aims are the ‘raison d’être’ of the processing operations. As a prerequisite for other data quality requirements, purpose specification will determine the relevant data to be collected, retention periods, and all other key aspects of how personal data will be processed for the chosen purpose/s._”\n\n5.36     In considering the purpose limitation principle, i.e. compatible use, it was set out that:\n\n“_There is a strong connection between transparency and purpose specification. When the specified purpose is visible and shared with stakeholders such as data protection authorities and data subjects, safeguards can be fully effective. Transparency ensures predictability and enables user control._”\n\n5.37      It was further stated that:\n\n“_In terms of accountability, specification of the purpose in writing and production of adequate documentation will help to demonstrate that the controller has complied with the requirement of Article 6(1)(b). It would allow data subjects to exercise their rights more effectively – for example, it would provide proof of the original purpose and allow comparison with subsequent processing purposes._”\n\n5.38 The Article 29 Working Party also emphasised the benefits to the data subject from such transparency and accountability, by enabling them to make informed choices. While I note that the guidance of the Article 29 Working Party is not binding on the Commission, it nevertheless is instructive in the understanding of transparency obligations and their relationship with the overarching principles enshrined in Article 5 GDPR. It is clear to me from the above that the purpose limitation principle has an important role to play, both in relation to the empowerment\n\nof the data subject, but also in relation to underpinning and supporting the objectives of the data protection framework as a whole under the GDPR.\n\n5.39 I am therefore of the view that, when considering what information must be provided in relation to the “purposes” of any processing operation, such as by way of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, it is important, amongst other things, to consider how the quality of information provided may potentially impact the effective operation of the other data protection principles. This is particularly the case where the wording of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR maps the approach of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, i.e. by describing the obligation arising by reference to “collection” and ‘further’ processing.\n\n5.40 The data controller must identify the categories of personal data that will be collected if they are to comply with the requirement to specify “purpose” in accordance with the purpose limitation principle. I am of the view that having access to the information required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR in conjunction with the category/categories of personal data being processed is essential if the data subject is to be empowered to hold the data controller accountable for compliance with the Article 5(1)(b) GDPR purpose limitation principle. The Article 29 Working Party reflects this approach in the Transparency Guidelines, by saying:\n\n“_Transparency, when adhered to by data controllers, empowers data subjects to hold data controllers and processors accountable and to exercise control over their personal data by, for example, providing or withdrawing informed consent and actioning their data subject rights. The concept of transparency in the GDPR is user-centric rather than legalistic and is realised by way of specific practical requirements on data controllers and processors in a number of articles._”[[158]](#_ftn158)\n\n5.41 For this reason, I expressed the view in the Preliminary Draft Decision that the information provided must set out: the purpose(s) of the specified processing operation/set of processing operations for which the (specified category/specified categories of) personal data are intended, and the legal basis being relied upon to support the processing operation/set of operations. In that information, there should be a clear link between the specified category/categories of data, the purpose(s) of the specified operation(s), and the legal basis being relied on to support the specified operation(s). In submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant agreed with this position and that “[w]_ithout such linking, we would simply see generic lists of all data, all purposes and all legal bases under Article 6(1) GDPR without any indication of the relationships between them._”.[[159]](#_ftn159)\n\n5.42 However, Facebook disagreed with this analysis. To set out the position simply, Facebook argues that it is only obliged to provide specific information on (1) the purposes for the processing it carries out and (2) the legal bases upon which it relies. This amounts to simply setting out its own purposes and the legal bases upon which it relies for the collection and processing of personal data in order to fulfil those objectives. Its position is that two pieces of information are required and, in addition, it argues that there is no requirement for the individual purposes to be linked with individual legal bases. \n\n5.43 Facebook submits that such a “_third limb_” is not necessary. It submits that purpose and legal basis are “_conceptually, capable of being explained and understood without any reference to the practicalities of the processing operations_”. It further submits that the provision of information on processing operations would in fact not aid transparency. In this regard, it also reiterates arguments already addressed above in relation to the alleged absence of a requirement under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR to specify processing operations.[[160]](#_ftn160) Facebook specifically argues that it would be “_very difficult to achieve in ways that are “concise” and “intelligible”, as required under Article 12(1) GDPR. This supposed requirement would therefore be intrinsically unlikely to assist data subjects or further the purposes behind the GDPR’s transparency regime_”[[161]](#_ftn161)\n\n5.44 As is evident from the assessments that follow, my view is that the Data Policy and related material sometimes, on the contrary, demonstrate an oversupply of very high level, generalised information at the expense of a more concise and meaningful delivery of the essential information necessary for the data subject to understand the processing being undertaken and to exercise his/her rights in a meaningful way. Furthermore, while Facebook has chosen to provide its transparency information by way of pieces of text, there are other options available, such as the possible incorporation of tables, which might enable Facebook to provide the information required in a clear and concise manner, particularly in the case of an information requirement comprising a number of linked elements. The importance of concision cannot be overstated nonetheless. Facebook is entitled to provide additional information to its users above and beyond that required by Article 13 and can provide whatever additional information it wishes. However, it must first comply with more specific obligations under the GDPR, and then secondly ensure that the additional information does not have the effect of creating information fatigue or otherwise diluting the effective delivery of the statutorily required information. That is simply what the GDPR requires. \n\n5.45 In support of the argument that the Commission’s interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR is incorrect, Facebook also refers to Article 14(1)(d) GDPR:\n\n“_14(1)(d) GDPR expressly requires a controller to provide information to the data subject on the categories of personal data (in circumstances where Article 14 applies) further reinforces this point - i.e. it is clear from the fact that the concept is referred to in Article 14(1)(d) GDPR, that the legislators made a deliberate choice not to include this concept in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. Indeed, if the Commission’s interpretation was correct there would have been no need for Article 14(1)(d) GDPR, as Article 14(1)(c) GDPR would in any event have to be approached on the basis that categories of data needed to be identified. As such, the Commission’s approach appears to conflict with the statutory interpretation principle expressio unis est exclusio alterius_”[[162]](#_ftn162)\n\n5.46 In addressing this argument, it is important to underline the fundamental differences between Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. The first fundamental difference between Articles 13 and 14 GDPR is that Article 13 GDPR is expressly stated to apply in circumstances where “_personal data are collected from the data subject_”. Article 14 GDPR, on the other hand, only applies in circumstances where personal data have been obtained from a source(s) other than the data subject. The second fundamental difference is that the information prescribed by Article 13 GDPR must be provided to the data subject “_at the time when personal data are obtained_”. The information prescribed by Article 14, however, can only be provided after the personal data has been collected.\n\n5.47 These fundamental differences give rise to variations in the information required to be provided pursuant to Article 13 GDPR, on the one hand, and the information required to be provided pursuant to Article 14 GDPR, on the other. Firstly, Article 13(2)(e) GDPR requires the controller to inform the data subject as to “_whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data._” Article 14 GDPR, on the other hand, contains no such requirement. The rationale for this difference is clear. When this information is provided prior to the collection of personal data, the data subject is empowered to exercise control over their personal data. It avoids them being placed in a position where they provide personal data to the controller on a mistaken understanding as to either the necessity for its collection, or of the potential consequences of failure to provide it. The provision of such information would have no purpose if provided to the data subject after the personal data has been collected, hence its omission from Article 14 GDPR.\n\n5.48 Secondly, Article 14(1)(d) GDPR requires that the data subject to be provided with information as to the “_categories of personal data concerned_” while Article 14(2)(f) GDPR requires the provision of information as to the source “_from which the personal data originate_”. These requirements are notably absent from Article 13. The rationale for these omissions is clear by reference to the exemption to the obligation to provide information set out in Articles 13(4) and Article 14(5)(a) GDPR. These exemptions provide that the controller’s obligation to provide the specified information “_shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information_”.\n\nTherefore, both of these transparency provisions clearly envisage that they need not apply where the data subject has the information in question.\n\n5.49 In some cases where personal data has been collected from the data subject, the data subject may already know the categories of personal data and the source of this information, because it is the data subject that has provided the personal data to the controller. Equally, however, some collection directly from the data subject is less obvious to the data subject for example where metadata or device data is collected from them. The data subject will, however, likely never have this knowledge if the data have been collected in the circumstances envisaged by Article 14 GDPR. It is therefore envisaged by both Articles 13 and 14 GDPR that in all circumstances, the data subject will have this information. In the case of Article 14 GDPR, the personal data has not been obtained by the data subject, and so Article 14 GDPR specifies that additional information should be provided. In the case of Article 13 GDPR, it may be the data subject who will have provided the data, and so the data subject may already know this information. In my view, this is the distinction between the provisions and the clear motivation of the legislator in including these categories of information in Article 14 GDPR alone. \n\n5.50 Furthermore, it is unclear why a data subject would only be entitled to this information if the controller has acquired their personal data from another source. It is further difficult to understand how such a difference in treatment, between two categories of data subject, could be consistent with the GDPR, particularly where the difference in treatment concerns a core data subject right. If this were true, a data subject would only be entitled to this information if the personal data were obtained from a source other than themselves, but would not if it was obtained from them directly. This entirely arbitrary distinction is inconsistent with the clear aims of the GDPR to provide a series of universal rights to all data subjects, grounded on the universal right to data protection in Article 8 of the Charter. Therefore even if the interpretation advanced in the preceding paragraph were incorrect, Facebook’s submissions would nonetheless not be supported by a purposive or systematic reading of the GDPR. \n\n5.51 In any event, Facebook’s submissions operate on the assumption that, as has been quoted above, Article 14(1)(d) GDPR would not be necessary if the Commission’s interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR were applied _mutatis mutandis_ to Article 14(1)(c) GDPR. This conflates the information the Commission’s interpretation requires i.e. the “processing operations or sets of operations”, and the information required by Article 14(1)(d) GDPR, i.e. “categories of personal data”.\n\n5.52  My view is Article 13(1)(c) GDPR therefore does require what has been described as the “third link” in this chain: the relevant information for the purposes of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR must be provided by reference to the processing operations themselves. This is supported both by a literal reading of the provision, having regard to the definition in Article 4(2) GDPR, and the systematic reading I have just set out above. This provision specifically refers to the purposes for which _the personal data_ are intended. When the purposes and legal basis for processing are identified, they\n\nmust be identified by reference to _the personal data_ being processed or, at a minimum, the broad personal data processing operations to which they relate. The purposes and legal basis of processing personal data can only be understood by reference to the processing operations being undertaken. In order for information in this regard to be meaningful, and to provide data subjects with meaningful information as to whether they wish to exercise data subject rights, data subjects must be provided with this information. This goes to the essence of transparency in relation to the processing of personal data. In providing information on “_the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing_” for the purposes of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, the data controller must do so by reference to the personal data being processed or, at least, the broad personal data processing operations involved.\n\n## INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FACEBOOK IN RELATION TO PROCESSING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 6(1)(B) GDPR\n\n5.53 The starting point in assessing this information provided by Facebook is the Data Policy. Facebook itself asserts that this is the document it uses to comply with the transparency obligations under Article 13(1)(b) GDPR. In the Data Policy, there is a section entitled “_What is our legal basis for processing data_?”. The section dealing with contractual necessity is as follows:\n\n_“We collect, use and share the data that we have in the ways described above:_\n\n•       _as necessary to fulfil our Facebook Terms of Service or Instagram Terms of Use”_\n\n5.54 I note at this point that the Data Policy contains a hyperlink where users can “_Learn more about these legal bases and how they relate to the ways in which we process data_”. This hyperlink is found at the end of the section partly quoted above, which lists processing carried out pursuant to each lawful basis under the GDPR. As I have set out in Section 2, this hyperlink directs Facebook users to an unnamed page that the Investigator terms the “Legal Basis Information Page”. For clarity, I retain this definition. This page sets out that:\n\n“_For all people who have legal capacity to enter into an enforceable contract, we process data as necessary to perform our contracts with you (the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms, together, 'the Terms'). We describe the contractual services for which this data processing is necessary in the “Our Services” section of the Terms, and in the additional informational resources accessible from the Terms. The core data uses necessary to provide our contractual services are:_\n\n•       _To provide, personalize, and improve our Facebook Products;_\n\n•       _To promote safety, integrity, and security;_\n\n•       _To transfer, transmit, store, or process your data outside the EEA, including to within the United States and other countries;_\n\n•       _To communicate with you, for example, on Product-related issues; and_\n\n•       _To provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products._\n\n_These uses are explained in more detail in our Data Policy, under “How do we use this information?” and “How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?” and “How do the Facebook Companies work together__?” We’ll use the data we have to provide these services; if you choose not to provide certain data, the quality of your experience using the Facebook Products may be impacted._”\n\n5.55 It is clear from the above that Facebook users are invited to receive more information from other hyperlinked sources. In relation to the “Terms of Service” hyperlink, it directs users to the relatively lengthy Terms of Service which includes several other hyperlinks, including a hyperlink to the Data Policy. Users are also directed to the “Our Services” section of the Terms of Service, which sets out the following:\n\n“_Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:_\n\n**_Provide a personalized experience for you:_**\n\n_Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search.

The approach taken is somewhat disjointed in that the “summary” of the “core data uses” has been set out in expressly generalised terms, divorced from specific processing operations. If the user wishes to learn more, they must view the Terms of Service and also review the sections of the Data Policy to which they are directed. When all of the available information has been accessed, it becomes apparent that the texts provided are variations of each other, in that they re-iterate the goals and objectives of Facebook in carrying out data processing (for example, personalisation, communication, analytics, product improvement, etc.) rather than elaborating on this or providing information concerning processing operations. This approach lacks clarity and concision, and makes it difficult for the user to access meaningful information as to the processing operations that will be grounded on Article\n\n6(1)(b) GDPR or on other legal bases. In my view, insufficient detail has been provided in relation to the processing operations carried out both in general and on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR specifically. Such an approach deprives the user of meaningful information and further risks causing significant confusion as to what legal basis will be relied upon to ground a specific processing operation. \n\n5.61 In response to the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant agreed with the approach taken on this issue, and emphasised that “_the most relevant change in Facebook’s position_”, in the Complainant’s view is that the decision to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question and not consent, following the GDPR taking legal effect, was contained in the last layer of information and not displayed prominently.[[163]](#_ftn163)\n\n5.62 In response to the Preliminary Draft Decision, which provisionally found that the information was provided in a disjointed manner and that the texts were variations of each other, Facebook submitted that it “…_maintains that the manner in which it has discharged its obligation under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR is entirely appropriate and compliant with the GDPR._”[[164]](#_ftn164) In particular, its position is that the documents have been structured so as to present the information in as simple a manner as possible. It also argues that the presence of information in separate hyperlinked pages that at times contains cross-over “_has been provided in a context where data subjects often wish to periodically seek out information of interest to them instead of digesting the entirety of these documents at once_”.[[165]](#_ftn165) It further defends the use of similar (but varied) text in the Data Policy to the Terms of Service on the grounds that they are distinct documents with distinct purposes, and that “[t]_he use of summary bullet points, instead of reproducing the relevant text from the Terms of Service in full makes the information more accessible to users regardless of their online or legal sophistication._”[[166]](#_ftn166)\n\n5.63 I do not accept these arguments. First of all, while it remains the case that it is for Facebook to provide accessible information that is clear and concise for users regardless of their “sophistication”, that does not detract from the core of the criticism that the disjointed information set out in generalised terms is “_divorced from specific processing_ _operations_”.188 It is not that the presence of variations of the same information in several documents is of itself noncompliant, but rather that it is not compliant when it amounts, in practice, to statements about services and objectives that are not linked to specified processing operations and which do not provide meaningful information to the data subject on the core issues identified in Article 13 GDPR. The fact that this disjointed information is generalised and does not contain the required information (as has been set out when I addressed the correct interpretation of Article 13(1)(c)\n\nGDPR), renders the information as a whole unhelpful and ultimately inconsistent with Article 13 GDPR.\n\n5.64 Put simply, it impossible to identify what processing operations will be carried out in order to fulfil the objectives that are repeated throughout the documents and the legal basis for such operations. In the absence of such information, the user is left to guess as to what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of the specified lawful bases, in order to fulfil these objectives. For the reasons set out above in relation to the correct interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, this is insufficient information.\n\n5.65 I note that some minimal information is provided in relation to the processing that will be carried out, notably in relation to location information and IP addresses. I note, however, that this is prefaced by “_such as_”, and describes location-based information as “_things like_…” These are, in my view, clear examples of the open-ended language that is not conducive to the provision of information in a transparent manner. Moreover, it is unclear for what purpose this personal data is used, and indeed to what extent any such data might be (however minimally) processed to fulfil the objectives of the contractual relationship between Facebook and a user, and to what extent the processing of such data is based on another legal basis such as consent.\n\n5.66 Article 12(1) GDPR requires information to be provided in a “_concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child._” The information that has been provided by Facebook is disjointed, and requires users to move in and out of various sections of the Data Policy and Terms of Service. I note that Facebook argues that “[c]_ritically, it is the Data Policy and the Legal Basis Information Page which are the means by which Facebook Ireland satisfies the requirements of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR (as explained above) – not the Terms of Service_”.[[167]](#_ftn167) As I have set out, however, I am not satisfied that the Data Policy and Legal Basis Information Page satisfy the requirements of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR either individually or cumulatively. \n\n5.67      Facebook argues that it met the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR and that:\n\n“_the GDPR allows considerable discretion for the controller as to the mode of compliance, taking into account its interests as well as those of data subjects its likely better understanding of both its services and its users, and; in particular allowing for a balancing of thoroughness with concision, intelligibility and accessibility. The obligation is not to provide information in a way that a particular supervisory authority (or anyone else) considers to be the best or preferred manner, but to do so in a way that meets an objective threshold standard._”190\n\n5.68 There is no doubt but that a controller has a certain amount of discretion as to the mode of compliance. Neither is there any question of a supervisory authority’s “preferred manner” having any bearing on compliance with Article 12(1) GDPR, or any other provision. Rather it falls to the supervisory authority to assess compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR. In this case, there has been a failure to provide information in a concise manner in light of the failings associated with the disjointed and generalised nature of the documents in question. The information is neither concise nor transparent, and the language is neither clear nor plain, instead being expressed by reference to abstract objectives and purposes without any connection to specific categories of personal data or processing operations being undertaken.\n\n5.69 Furthermore, it is concerning that, even if a user actively sought out the additional information that is available by way of the various links from the Terms of Service, the user would be presented with variations of information previously furnished rather than further and more detailed information that would enable the user to better understand the processing involved. By way of example, there is significant overlap between the information set out in the “How do we use this information” section of the Data Policy and the contents of the “Our Services” section of the Terms of Service. Similarly, the summary of “core uses” set out in the section of the Legal Basis Information Page that deals with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR contains a sub-set of the information provided in the “Our Services” section of the Terms of Service. The way in which the information has been spread out on multiple subsections and has been drafted in similarly worded (and hyperlinked) text means that a user could easily overlook any new elements available within the linked text. It is not the case that a user would be presented with more detailed information once they go to the pages they are directed to; the information made available is similar in both substance and appearance to the information that is available both in the primary text and other hyperlinked texts. The submissions of Facebook on the Preliminary Draft Decision, as set out above, defend this practice. However, in my view, the varied sophistication of users is not a sufficient excuse to provide information that is, as I have set out, variations of the same thing rather than information that gradually becomes more detailed. This issue is compounded by the absence of information on processing operations themselves. Even the most sophisticated user would struggle to understand the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing in this context.\n\n5.70 I emphasise that the Investigator, in preparing the Final Report, carried out a highly detailed and thorough analysis of the documents set out above and how they interrelate. While I have adopted a different approach, in not considering each “layer” in the abstract, I am equally convinced that the requisite information is neither present nor set out in a transparent manner. Moreover, I am of the view that, where this is the case on a cumulative reading of all of the documents (a matter on which I am in clear agreement with the Investigator), in this instance, nothing of substance turns on the question of whether an individualised assessment of each “layer” should be carried out. \n\n5.71 I am of the view that the criticisms in the Complaint have merit to the extent that the information provided was not to the standard of clarity required by the GDPR. The way in which the relevant information has been presented requires the user to seek out the additional texts made available by way of the various hyperlinks. There is no single composite text or layered route available to the user such as would allow them to quickly and easily understand the full extent of processing operations that will take place as regards their personal data arising from their acceptance of the Terms of Service. Each additional layer presents the user with similar information to that already provided as well as some new information which is not easy to identify, as the language used is similar to the information that has been provided before. The user should not have to work so hard to access the prescribed information; nor should there be ambiguity as to whether all sources of information have been exhausted. This gives rise to real risks, such as those articulated by the Complainant, that there will be confusion as to what legal basis is being relied on for what processing operation(s). That is precisely what seems to have happened in the context of this Complaint, and is one of the main factual themes running through this entire Inquiry.\n\n5.72 Information on the specific processing operations (necessarily including the data processed) that will be carried out for the purposes specified and by reference to the lawful bases specified (the latter two being currently, in my view, set out in a disjointed manner) should have been provided to the data subject. To the extent that this information was provided at all, it was not clearly linked with a specific purpose or lawful basis, and was described in an ambiguous manner (such as in my analysis of the information on location-based data above). \n\n5.73 The alleged “forced consent” and the dispute surrounding the processing operations being carried out, and the legal bases underpinning them, are reflective of a broader lack of clarity as regards the link between the purposes of processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved. Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires that this information be set out, and Article 12(1) GDPR requires that this same information be set out in a particular manner. \n\n5.74 Finally, in its submission on the Preliminary Draft Decision, Facebook took issue with a proposed finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. In particular, Facebook argued that there cannot be an automatic infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR simply because Articles 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR have been infringed, or in the alternative that nothing further has occurred beyond the infringements to merit a finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.[[168]](#_ftn168) \n\n5.75 The Commission does not consider that an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR necessarily or automatically flows from findings of infringement under Articles 12 and/or 13 GDPR. Nevertheless, there is an important link between these provisions. \n\n5.76 By way of elaboration, at the core of this Complaint lies an assumption on the Complainant’s part that Facebook, which relied largely on consent as a matter of data protection law for the processing in question up to the coming into effect of the GDPR, was still relying on GDPR consent for the acceptance of the Terms of Service following the coming into effect of the GDPR. It has been submitted that this assumption was compounded by the engagement flow which presented users with a number of opportunities to consent, before the final “I agree”.\n\n5.77 While there is no particularised requirement under the GDPR to provide data subjects with information on an alteration of a legal basis, or to provide information in a particular part of any such engagement flow, the lack of clarity on such a fundamental issue underlines the inherent lack of transparency in the information provided to the data subject. Article 5(1)(a) links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of a controller by requiring that personal data shall be “_processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject_”.[[169]](#_ftn169) Having regard to the findings made above, it is appropriate for the Commission to make a finding that Facebook has also infringed Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in the circumstances of this case.\n\n**Finding 3: In relation to processing for which Facebook indicated reliance upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) have been infringed**.\n\n**Additional Issue: Whether Facebook infringed the Article 5(1)(a) GDPR principle of fairness**\n\n5.78 During the course of the Article 60 consultation period, the Italian SA raised an objection to the Draft Decision, the purpose of which was to require the amendment of the Draft Decision to include a new finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.  The Commission decided not to follow the objection in circumstances where compliance with the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness was not examined during the course of this inquiry and, consequently, Facebook was never afforded the opportunity to be heard in response to a particularised allegation of wrongdoing, as required by Irish and EU law.  Accordingly the Commission referred the objection to the EDPB for determination pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.  Having considered the matter, the EDPB determined as follows:\n\n219.       The EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Articles 6(2) and 6(3)(b) GDPR refer to lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Articles 13(2), 14(2) and 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing.\n\n220.       On the basis of the above consideration, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s view that “_Article 5(1)(a) links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of a controller_”[[170]](#_ftn170) but considers that the principle of fairness has an independent meaning and stresses that an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of transparency does not automatically rule out the need for an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness too.\n\n221.       The EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights[[171]](#_ftn171). The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect of the principle of fairness in the context of processing personal data. For example, the EDPB has previously opined in its Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “_Fairness is an overarching principle which requires that personal data should not be processed in a way that is unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject_”[[172]](#_ftn172).\n\n222.       Among the key fairness elements that controllers should consider in this regard, the EDPB has mentioned autonomy of the data subjects, data subjects’ expectation, power balance, avoidance of deception, ethical and truthful processing[[173]](#_ftn173). These elements are particularly relevant in the case at hand. The principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR underpins the entire data protection framework and seeks to address power asymmetries between the data controllers and the data subjects in order to cancel out the negative effects of such asymmetries and ensure the effective exercise of the data subjects’ rights. The EDPB has previously explained that “_the principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller”[**[174]**](#_ftn174)._\n\n223.       The EDPB recalls that a fair balance must be struck between, on the one hand, the commercial interests of the controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of the data subjects under the GDPR[[175]](#_ftn175). A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR refers to pursuing “_power balance_” as a “_key objective of the controller-data subject relationship_”[[176]](#_ftn176), especially in the context of online services provided without monetary payment, where users are often not aware of the ways and extent to which their personal data is being processed[[177]](#_ftn177). Consequently, lack of transparency can make it almost impossible in practice for the data subjects to exercise an informed choice over the use of their data[[178]](#_ftn178), which is in contrast with the element of “_autonomy_” of data subjects as to the processing of their personal data[[179]](#_ftn179).\n\n224.       Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is particularly important to ensure that data subjects are protected from any form of abuse and deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into account the particular service that is being provided and the characteristics of their users, serves as a shield from the danger of abuse and deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries.\n\n225.       The EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to the principles of fairness and purpose limitation[[180]](#_ftn180). In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users via the Facebook Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, compliance with the principle of fairness also relates to “_how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with its social networking service”[**[181]**](#_ftn181)._ Thus, the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness requires also an assessment of the consequences that the choice and presentation of the legal basis entail for the Facebook service users. In addition, that assessment cannot be made in the abstract, but has to take into account the specificities of the particular social networking service and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising[[182]](#_ftn182).\n\n226.       The EDPB notes that in this particular case the breach of Meta IE’s transparency obligations is of such gravity that it clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of the Facebook users by confusing them on whether clicking the “Accept” button results in giving their consent to the processing of their personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance with the principle of fairness is avoiding deception i.e. providing information “_in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design_”[[183]](#_ftn183).\n\n227.       As the IE SA itself notes, the Complainant argues that Meta IE relied on “forced consent” for the processing simply because it did in fact believe that the legal basis for processing the controller was relying upon was consent[[184]](#_ftn184). This is illustrated by the multiple arguments that the Complainant presents in order to demonstrate the “_forced consent_”, including the reference to the use by Meta IE of “_additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users”[**[185]**](#_ftn185)_. For example, the Complainant refers to the inclusion in the user interface page of _“two fake red dots (violation against Article 5(1)(a) – neither ‘fair’, nor ‘transparent’), that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot access without consenting – even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality”[**[186]**](#_ftn186)_. The EDPB considers that the LSA should have taken into account the use of such practices by Meta IE in relation to the principle of fairness, regardless of its finding that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service[[187]](#_ftn187).\n\n228.       In addition, and as previously mentioned in paragraph 97 of this Binding Decision, the Complainant presents the results of a poll according to which only 1.6% to 2.5% of the 1000 Facebook users who responded to the poll understood the request to accept the Facebook Terms of Service to be a contract[[188]](#_ftn188). In the EDPB’s view, there are clear indications that Facebook users’ expectations with regard to the applicable legal basis have not been fulfilled[[189]](#_ftn189).\n\n229.       As recognised by the IE SA itself, “_the user is left to guess as to what processing is carried out on what data”[**[190]**](#_ftn190)_. Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Facebook users are left ”_in the dark_\"214and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful[[191]](#_ftn191) because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, which ultimately restricts the Facebook users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights.\n\n230.       Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the extensive analysis by the IE SA with regard to the issue of legal basis and transparency in relation to the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is closely linked to the issue of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness. Considering the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Facebook users in a misleading manner[[192]](#_ftn192), which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that the IE SA’s finding of breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to the principle of transparency[[193]](#_ftn193) should extend to the principle of fairness too.\n\n231.       This is all the more supported by the fact that, in the circumstances of the present case as demonstrated above[[194]](#_ftn194), the overall effect of the infringements by Meta IE of the transparency obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), 13(1)(c) GDPR and the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR219further intensifies the imbalanced nature of the relationship between Meta IE and the Facebook users brought up by the IT SA objection. The combination of factors, such as the asymmetry of the information created by Meta IE with regard to Facebook service users, combined with the “take it or leave it” situation that they are faced with due to the lack of alternative services in the market and the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular processing under the contract with Meta IE, systematically disadvantages Facebook service users, limits their control over the processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under Chapter III of the GDPR.\n\n232.       Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include a finding of an infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE, in addition to the infringement of the principle of transparency under the same provision, and to adopt the appropriate corrective measures, by addressing, but without being limited to, the question of an administrative fine for this infringement as provided for in Section 9 of this Binding Decision.\n\n5.79 Accordingly, and as directed by the EDPB further to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Facebook has infringed the principle of fairness pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.\n\n**Finding 4: Facebook has infringed the principle of fairness pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.**\n\n### 6     SUMMARY OF FINDINGS\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n|**ISSUE**|**FINDING**|\n|Reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR|I find that Facebook infringed Article 6(1) GDPR when it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of its offering of Terms of Service.|\n|Whether Facebook failed to provide necessary information regarding its legal basis for processing pursuant to acceptance of the Terms of Service and whether the information set out was set out in a transparent manner|I find that Facebook has infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR|\n|As raised by the Italian SA by way of its objection, whether Facebook infringed the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness in the context of its approach to the provision of information as part of the presentation of its Terms of Service to the Complainant.|As directed by the EDPB pursuant to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Facebook has infringed the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.|\n\n### 7    DECISION ON CORRECTIVE POWERS\n\n7.1 I have set out above, pursuant to Section 111(1)(a) of the 2018 Act, my view to the effect that the Facebook has infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  As required by the EDPB pursuant to the Article 65 Decision, I have also found that Facebook has infringed Article 6(1) GDPR as well as the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.\n\n7.2 Under Section 111(2) of the 2018 Act, where the Commission makes a decision (in accordance with Section 111(1)(a)), it must, in addition, make a decision as to whether a corrective power should be exercised in respect of the controller or processor concerned and, if so, the corrective power to be exercised. For the reasons set out above and the reasons below, my view is that corrective measures should be exercised.\n\n### 8    ORDER TO BRING PROCESSING INTO COMPLIANCE\n\n8.1 Article 58(2) GDPR sets out the corrective powers which supervisory authorities may employ in respect of non-compliance by a controller or processor.\n\n8.2 My view is that the corrective power provided for in Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, i.e. an order to bring processing into compliance (“the **Order**”), should be imposed. **The Order would, firstly, require Facebook to bring the Data Policy and Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards information provided on: (i) data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as well as (ii) data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook service, in accordance with the principles set out in this Decision**. Facebook argues that it is neither necessary nor proportionate to make this order.[[195]](#_ftn195) For the reasons set out above and below, I have concluded that it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\n\n8.3 It was proposed in the Preliminary Draft Decision that this order should be complied with within three months of the date of notification of any final decision. Facebook argued that this was not a reasonable period of time within which to make the necessary changes, as the changes would be resource-intensive and would require “_sufficient lead in time for preparing the relevant changes, conducting and taking account of user testing of the proposed changes, internal crossfunctional engagement as well as of course engagement with the Commission, and localisation and translation of the information for countries in the European Region._”221\n\n8.4 Facebook is a large multinational organisation with significant financial, technological and human resources at its disposal. Moreover, the interim period, prior to any such rectification to the current lack of information being provided to data subjects, will involve a serious ongoing deprivation of their rights (as articulated in Section 9 below). Moreover, the Commission has provided specific analysis to Facebook in relation to the correct interpretation of the provisions in question and the requisite information that is absent from the relevant user-facing documents. This specificity should negate any need for extensive engagement with the Commission during the period of implementation, and provides clarity for Facebook as to what objective its very significant resources should be directed towards in order to comply with this order. As such, I am not satisfied that it would be impossible or indeed disproportionate to make an order in these terms, having regard to the importance of the data subject rights involved, the specificity of the order and Facebook’s resources.\n\n8.5 I therefore order that the Terms of Service and Data Policy be brought into compliance within a period of **three months** commencing on the day following the date of service, on Facebook, of this Decision.\n\n8.6 I consider that the Order is necessary to ensure that full effect is given to Facebook’s obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), and 13(1)(c) GDPR in light of the infringements outlined above. The substance of the Order is the only way in which the defects pointed out in this Decision can be rectified, which is essential to the protection of the rights of data subjects. It is on this basis that\n\nI am of the view that this power should be exercised. Facebook disagrees and states that it is already voluntarily attempting to alter the documents to express the views set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision, and would therefore like to continue using “_less onerous means_” to ensure compliance.[[196]](#_ftn196) \n\n8.7 However, having regard to the non-compliance in this Decision, in my view, such an order is proportionate and is the minimum order required in order to guarantee that compliance will take place in the future. The fact that Facebook is already taking steps to bring its information into compliance means that there would be nothing practically onerous about an order to carry out something that Facebook already intends to carry out. On that basis I see nothing in these arguments to suggest a lack of proportionality arises in relation to the Order.\n\n8.8 As instructed by the EDPB, in paragraph 288 of the Article 65 Decision, **the Order would, secondly, require Facebook to take the necessary action to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising (“the Processing”), in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service, into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR in accordance with the conclusion reached by the EDPB, as recorded at paragraphs 132 and 133 of the Article 65 Decision within a period of three months, commencing on the day following the date of service, on Facebook, of this Decision**.  More specifically, in this regard, Facebook is required to take the necessary action to address the EDPB’s finding that Facebook is not entitled to carry out the Processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, taking into account the analysis and views expressed by the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 of the Article 65 Decision.  Such action may include, but is not limited to, the identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis, in Article 6(1) GDPR, for the Processing together with the implementation of any necessary measures, as might be required to satisfy the conditionality associated with that/those alternative legal basis/bases.\n\n8.9        By way of its Final Submissions, Facebook submitted as follows:\n\na.       Firstly[[197]](#_ftn197), in relation to the matters covered by the term “the Processing” (as defined in paragraph 8.8, above), Facebook noted its understanding that this term refers “_specifically to the processing for the purpose of behavioural advertising carried out by [Facebook] to-date on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the Terms of Service as considered in the Inquiry_.”  Facebook noted that, as previously explained in its Article 65 Submissions, it carries out certain other types of processing for behavioural advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.  For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm Facebook’s understanding as to the processing covered by the second limb of the above Order.  The term “the Processing”, as defined in paragraph 8.8, above, means any processing for behavioural advertising purposes which has been carried out by Facebook to date, in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.\n\nb.       Secondly, Facebook submitted[[198]](#_ftn198) that, notwithstanding the EDPB’s determination, the Commission has discretion as regards the date of commencement of the applicable compliance periods.  In this regard, Facebook noted that the Article 65 Decision does not require the Commission to provide that the Order must take effect “_on the day following the date of service of the [Commission’s] final decision_”.  Facebook further submitted[[199]](#_ftn199) that the timeline for compliance, as regards the action required to be taken pursuant to both limbs of the Order, should run consecutively rather than concurrently.\n\nc.       In support of the above submissions, Facebook has estimated that it “_will take at least   to implement both compliance orders_” by reference to the work that will be required to give effect to the terms of the Order.  This work includes (but is not limited to) \n\n.  Facebook has further identified that, once this\n\nwork is completed, it will then need to develop and/or update user-facing materials, to the extent needed to explain these changes to users, including updates to the Privacy Policy and other transparency notices.\n\nd.       Facebook has further submitted that, if the Order is made in the terms proposed, this would require it to dedicate its resources to attempting to comply with the Order immediately and “_certainly before the period within which [Facebook] is entitled to appeal from the final decision has elapsed_.”  This, according to Facebook, would seriously “_impair and prejudice_” its right to an effective appeal.\n\n8.10           Having considered the above matters in light of the Article 65 Decision, I do not agree with Facebook’s submission that the Commission has discretion to delay the activation of the timeline for compliance associated with any aspect of the Order.  It is clear, from paragraph 286 of the Article 65 Decision, that the EDPB considered it necessary for Facebook to take the remedial action required to address the relevant infringements “_within three months_”.  While Facebook has correctly identified that the EDPB has not expressly identified the starting point of this compliance period, the Commission’s view is that it goes without saying that the starting point has to be the adoption and notification of the Commission’s final decision, given that this is the earliest time from which the applicable timeline for compliance can start to run.  Any contrary suggestion would be inconsistent with the need for urgent action that was clearly indicated to be required in paragraphs 286, 288 and 290 of the Article 65 Decision.  It would further render meaningless the EDPB’s consideration of the compliance period in terms of a fixed number of months (in this case, three).\n\n8.11           Insofar as Facebook appears to consider it significant that the Commission itself amended the terms of the existing Order such that the timeline for compliance is now stated to run from the day following the date of service, on Facebook, of this Decision, the Commission does not consider this to be a material amendment of the existing text.  The Commission considered it necessary to add this clarification to address the risk of there being a delay between the date of adoption of this Decision and the date on which this Decision is formally notified to/served upon Facebook (as has occurred in at least one previous inquiry).  The clarification ensures legal certainty, as regards the timelines associated with the Order and Facebook’s right to a judicial remedy.\n\n8.12           Finally, as regards the resources that Facebook will need to devote to the matters covered by the terms of the Order, I note that I have already had regard to the significant financial, technological and human resources at Facebook’s disposal.  Furthermore, I do not agree that Facebook will need to await the outcome of its efforts to achieve compliance with the second limb of the Order before it might address the first limb.  I note, in this regard, that the first limb of the Order was present in the Draft Decision (dated 6 October 2021).  Facebook was already aware of the likelihood that it would have to take action to address the shortcomings identified as part of the analysis that underpinned the findings of infringement of the transparency provisions (namely Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR).  In the circumstances, Facebook has already had time to begin the groundwork required to achieve compliance with its transparency obligations.\n\n8.13           For the avoidance of doubt, I am not persuaded by Facebook’s submission that the envisaged date of commencement of the timeline for compliance would “_seriously impair and prejudice_” its right to an effective appeal.  I note, in this regard, that Facebook has not explained how such a risk would arise from the timely implementation of the deadline for compliance with the Order.  I further note that matters pertaining to the possible filing of any appeal will likely be dealt with by Facebook’s internal and external legal advisors as opposed to the “stakeholders” whose input will be required as part of Facebook’s efforts to achieve compliance with the terms of the Order.  While I anticipate that there will, of course, be overlap in terms of the resources that might need to devote time to both the required remedial action and matters pertaining to the possible filing of any appeal, I do not envisage how such overlap would be anywhere near total such as to give rise to a risk to Facebook’s ability to exercise its right to an effective appeal.  I further note that the compliance deadline extends beyond the limitation periods prescribed for any application for judicial redress under Irish law.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that Facebook’s right to pursue judicial redress will not be impaired by the compliance periods outlined above.\n\n### 9     ADMINISTRATIVE FINE\n\n9.1 I note that Article 58(2)(i) GDPR permits me to consider the imposition of an administrative fine, pursuant to Article 83 GDPR, “in addition to, or instead of” the other measures outlined in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case. This is also reflected in Section 115 of the 2018 Act, which permits the Commission to impose an administrative fine on its own or in combination with any other corrective power specified in Article 58(2) GDPR. Article 83(1) GDPR, in turn, identifies that the administration of fines “_shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive_”.  \n\n9.2 Further, when deciding whether or not to impose an administrative fine and the amount of any such fine, Article 83(2) GDPR requires me to give “_due regard_” to eleven criteria. Those criteria, together with my assessment of each, are set out below.\n\n9.3 In the Draft Decision, I considered the imposition of an administrative fine in relation to the finding of infringement identified at Finding 3 above, namely the finding of infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of Facebook’s approach to transparency.  Following the circulation of the Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned for the purpose of enabling them to share their views, in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections to the administrative fines proposed by the Draft Decision were raised by the supervisory authorities of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland.  Having considered those objections, the EDPB determined as follows:\n\n351. The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines. A fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, as required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the case. In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. \n\n…\n\n353.       The finding in the Draft Decision of a transparency infringement for the processing concerned still stands. The EDPB recalls that, on substance, no objections were raised on this finding. Meta IE infringed its general transparency obligations by being unclear on the link between the purposes of processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved, irrespective of the validity of the legal basis relied on for the ‘processing concerned’. It remains the case that, for the transparency infringements, ‘the processing concerned’ should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that Meta IE carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which Meta IE indicated it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, including for the purposes of behavioural advertising. This is without prejudice to the fact that Meta IE inappropriately relied on 6(1)(b) as a legal basis to process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising as part of the delivery of its Facebook service under the Facebook Terms of Service. Whether or not Meta IE appropriately chose its legal basis for processing, the transparency infringement as assessed in the Draft Decision still stands. Therefore, the IE SA must not modify this description retroactively in light of the assessment of the validity of the legal basis, including for the purpose of carrying out any reassessment of the administrative fines originally proposed by the Draft Decision, as might be required by this Binding Decision. \n\n354.       In light of the objections found relevant and reasoned, the EDPB addresses whether the Draft Decision proposes a fine for the transparency infringements that is in accordance with the criteria established by Article 83(2) GDPR and the criteria provided for by Article 83(1)\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||GD|PR. In doing this, the EDPB will first|   |   |   |   |   |look into a preliminary matter, then assess the disputes|   |   |   |   |\n||ari|sen in respect of the analysis of sp|   |   |   |   |   |ecific criteria under Article 83(2) performed by the LSA,|   |   |   |   |\n||an|d then examine whether the pro|   |   |   |   |   |posed fine meets the requirements of effectiveness,|   |   |   |   |\n||dis|suasiveness and proportionality se|   |   |   |   |   |t in Article 83(1) GDPR, including by affording adequate|   |   |   |   |\n||we|ight to the relevant factors and to|   |   |   |   |   |the circumstances of the case.|   |   |   |   |\n||_Pre_|_liminary matter: the total turnover_|   |   |   |   |   |_of the undertaking_|   |   |   |   |\n||355|. The DE SAs does not contest th|   |   |   |   |   |e identification of the relevant undertaking in the IE SAs|   |   |   |   |\n||Dr|aft Decision, but contests the turn|   |   |   |   |   |over figure cited in the Draft Decision. Though the IE SA|   |   |   |   |\n||de|ems the objection not relevant, in t|   |   |   |   |   |he Composite Response the IE SA agrees with the DE SAs|   |   |   |   |\n||on|the principle that the total tu|   |   |   |   |   |rnover figure should be used when calculating the|   |   |   |   |\n||ad|ministrative fine. Moreover, the IE|   |   |   |   |   |SA adds that _“the turnover figure in the final decision will_|   |   |   |   |\n||_in_|_any event refer to the 2021 turnove_|   |   |   |   |   |_r for Meta Platforms, Inc. and Meta Ireland”_.|   |   |   |   |\n||356|. For the avoidance of doubt, the|   |   |   |   |   |EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into consideration the|   |   |   |   |\n||tot|al turnover of all the entities co|   |   |   |   |   |mposing the single undertaking, i.e. the consolidated|   |   |   |   |\n||tur|nover of the group of companies h|   |   |   |   |   |eaded by Meta Platforms, Inc..|   |   |   |   |\n||357|. On the notion of “_preceding fin_|   |   |   |   |   |_ancial year_”, the EDPB recalls the decision taken in its|   |   |   |   |\n||Bin|ding Decision 1/2021 (paragraph|   |   |   |   |   |298) and takes note of the IE SA’s intention to take the|   |   |   |   |\n||sa|me approach in the current case.|   |   |   |   |   ||   |   |   |   |\n||358|. In addition, the EDPB agrees wit|   |   |   |   |   |h the approach taken by the IE SA for the present case to|   |   |   |   |\n||inc|lude in the Draft Decision a prov|   |   |   |   |   |isional turnover figure based on the most up to date|   |   |   |   |\n||fin|ancial information available at the|   |   |   |   |   |time of circulation to the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(3)|   |   |   |   |\n||GD|PR. The final decision will have|   |   |   |   |   |to refer to the whole undertaking’s annual turnover|   |   |   |   |\n||cor|responding to the financial year pr|   |   |   |   |   |eceding the date of the final decision.|   |   |   |   |\n||_Th_|_e number of data subjects affected_|   |   |   |   |   |_(Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)_|   |   |   |   |\n||359|. The DE SAs puts forward that th|   |   |   |   |   |e number of affected data subjects may be even higher|   |   |   |   |\n|tha|n the|   ||   |monthly users as|   |of May 2021 in the European Economic Area confirmed|   |   |   |   |\n|by|Meta IE to|   |   |the IE SA. The DE SAs re|   |   |fer to a Meta Platforms, Inc. press release of 27 January|   |   |   |   |\n||20|21, inferrin|   |   |g from that “_whilst [M_|   |   |_eta Platforms, Inc.] reported 2.80 billion monthly active_|   |   |   |   |\n||_us_|_ers, they rep_|   |   |_ort 3.30 billion ‘family_|   |   |_monthly active people’ for 2020.

The IE S|   |   |   |A is “_satisfied that the reference to the number of users of the ‘family’ of apps_|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||_refers to the t_|   |   |   |_otal number of users across all apps owned by Meta Platforms Inc., (i.e. also_|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||_including user_|   |   |   |_s of WhatsApp and Instagram) and not solely the number of users of the_|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||_Facebook App_|   |   |   |_. Such apps are not covered by the Facebook Terms of Service, and so are not_|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||_relevant to the_|   |   |   |_present circumstances_”.  Meta IE confirms the IE SA’s response, adding that the|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||2020 figures ci|   |   |   |ted in the DE SAs’ objection “_relate to the global number of unique people using_|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||_at least one of_|   |   |   |_the Meta Family of Apps_”.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n||||||||||||||\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|361.           From the elements put forward, the EDPB sees no reason to question the response given by the IE SA on this objection. Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to be amended with regard to the number of data subjects affected. This is without prejudice to the conclusions reached below on whether the fine is in line with Article 83, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the number of data subjects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_On any action taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects (Article_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_83(2)(c) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e362.           The PL SA disagrees with the mitigating factor identified by the IE SA by reference to Meta IE’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the conclusion of the inquiry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e363.           The IE SA states that “_[Meta IE]’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis_” should be understood as actions taken to mitigate the damage to data subjects, distinct from actions taken to comply. In the present case, the EDPB fails to see how such a distinction can be made. Additionally, drawing this distinction seems inconsistent with the IE SA’s position that the negative impact on data subjects lies precisely in the transparency infringements and thus in the “_the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective_”. In other words, the damage caused to data subjects is, in these circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e364.           In addition, the EDPB agrees with the PL SA that the expression of an “_intention to bring the processing operations into the compliance with the provisions of GDPR_” as such cannot serve as evidence of actions already taken to mitigate damage suffered. In order for this element to serve as a mitigating factor, further evidence would be necessary for instance demonstrating that the controller did whatever they could in order to reduce the consequences of the breach for the individuals concerned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e365.           The EDPB agrees with the IE SA that “_[taking] steps to attempt to comply with legal obligations is a duty, and has no mitigating impact on a sanction for a breach of those obligations_”. In any case, Meta IE’s “_decision to begin preparation for voluntary compliance on the basis of the views set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision_” is merely a first step of a longer process towards full compliance with the GDPR. The information available in the file does not include indications that the actions taken by the controller have gone beyond willingness to prepare to change its practices in case this appeared necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e366.           The EDPB finds the IE SA does not provide sufficient justification for the mitigating factor identified, and instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision on this matter, by considering this factor as neither aggravating nor mitigating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_On other factors and the non-exhaustive nature of the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e367.           Meta IE argues some CSAs “introduce criteria that are not provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR”, which “_amounts to a breach of the principle of legal certainty, which is of particular importance with respect to the imposition of administrative fines which are criminal in nature_”.|\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|Meta IE acknowledges that Article 83(2)(k) GDPR is open-ended as it refers to any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, arguing however that the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR focus only on the data controller or processor, or on the infringement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e368.           The EDPB does not share such a restrictive reading of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, which it deems leaves room for “_all the reasoned considerations regarding the socio-economic context in which the controller or processor operates, those relating to the legal context and those concerning the market context_”. The EDPB considers this provision “_of fundamental importance for adjusting the amount of the fine to the specific case_” and that “_it should be interpreted as an instance of the principle of fairness and justice applied to the individual case_”. The EDPB recalls that Article 83(2) GDPR contains a non-exhaustive list of assessment criteria to be considered, if appropriate, by the LSA in determining the amount of the fine corresponding to what is necessary to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e369.           Given the open-ended nature of Article 83(2), the EDPB disagrees with the argument by Meta IE contending that the principle of legal certainty was breached. In any case, the EDPB recalls that it is settled case law that legal certainty is not absolute. All cases of application of a general norm can “_not be determined in advance by the legislature_”. Therefore, legal certainty “_cannot be interpreted as prohibiting the gradual clarification of rules of criminal liability by means of interpretations in the case-law” and undertakings are expected to take appropriate legal advice to anticipate the possible consequences of a rule and to assess the risk of infringement with “special care”. Finally, even if were the case that supervisory authorities had previously issued conflicting views, such a circumstance would not be relevant when assessing the predictability of an infringement. The ECtHR has also ruled that the fact that a point of law is ruled on for the first time does not undermine legal certainty “if the meaning given is both foreseeable and consistent with the essence of the offence”._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e370.           As explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from the infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. When applying this provision, the supervisory authorities must _“assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified”_. Therefore, financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e371.           The aim of Article 83(2)(k) is to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case. With regard to the financial benefits obtained from the infringement, the EDPB considers that when there is a benefit, the sanction should aim at “_counterbalancing the gains from the infringement_” while keeping an effective, dissuasive and proportionate fine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e372.           The financial benefit obtained by Meta IE was considered by the IE SA in the Draft Decision with regard to the transparency infringements. The IE SA found it had insufficient elements to conclude - beyond speculating - that Meta IE benefited from the infringement.|\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||373.|The DE SAs disagree with the IE SA’s decision to set aside this factor.

I|n the present case, neither the IE SA nor the DE SAs have provided an estimation of the|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||finan|cial benefit gained by Meta IE with the transparency infringements. The DE SAs’|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||calcul|ation presents an example and is still largely based on assumptions on a lower number|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||of m|onthly users. Due to this, the EDPB does not have sufficiently precise information to|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||evalu|ate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||376.|Therefore, the EDPB considers that it does not have objective elements to conclude|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||whet|her the fine envisaged in relation to the transparency infringements takes sufficient|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||acco|unt of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement and, therefore, has a deterrent|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||effect|in this respect.|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||377.|Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||effect|if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||infrin|gement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if further estimation of the|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||finan|cial benefit from the infringement of transparency obligations is possible in this case.|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||Insof|ar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||requ|ests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||_The p_|_rofitability of the undertaking - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)_|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||378.|The DE SAs request the IE SA to consider, in addition to turnover, the annual profit of the|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||unde|rtaking in its assessment. The DE SAs position is that the undertaking’s sensitivity to|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||admi|nistrative fines is significantly influenced by profitability, not only turnover. The DE SAs|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||argue|that the Draft Decision does not demonstrate that profitability was taken into account|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||to as|sess “sensitivity to administrative fines” and does not ensure the fine is effective,|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||prop|ortionate and dissuasive.|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||379.|Meta IE argues Article 83(2) GDPR does not identify annual profit as a factor to which the|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||LSA s|hould have regard in calculating the amount of the administrative fine. The EDPB has|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||expla|ined its view on the open-ended character of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR above (see paragraphs|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||367-3|69).|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||380.|The EDPB recalls that in determining administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR the total|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||world|wide annual turnover of the undertaking should be considered, as this _“gives an_|   |   |   |   |   ||\n||||||||||\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|_indication, albeit approximate and imperfect, of the size of the undertaking and of its economic power_”. The EDPB does not find that in the case at hand the LSA should be requested to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the annual profit of the undertaking. At the same time, the EDPB reiterates that the imposition of an appropriate fine cannot be the result of a simple calculation based on the total turnover and that as stated above all the circumstances of the specific case have to be considered in order to assess if the administrative fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive as required by Article 83(1) GDPR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e381.           Moreover, the size of the undertaking concerned and its financial capacity are elements that should be taken into account in the calculation of the amount of the fine in order to ensure its dissuasive nature. Taking into consideration the size and global resources of the undertaking in question is justified by the impact sought on the undertaking concerned, in order to ensure that the fine has sufficient deterrent effect, given that the fine must not be negligible in the light, particularly, of its financial capacity. The EDPB recalls that a fine to be imposed on an undertaking may need to be increased to take into account a particularly large turnover of the undertaking, so the fine is sufficiently dissuasive. In this respect, the EDPB further notes that in order to ensure a sufficiently deterrent effect, the global turnover of the undertaking can be considered also in light of the undertaking’s ability to raise the necessary funds to pay its fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness of the administrative fine (Article 83(1) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e382.           With regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour, or both. In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again). Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages both the controller or processor concerned as well as other controllers or processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct. Proportionality of the fine needs also to be ensured as the measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective. In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s views that there is no basis to conclude that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e383.           The EDPB reiterates that it is incumbent upon the supervisory authorities to verify whether the amount of the envisaged fines meets the requirements of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple infringements, increases and decreases for aggravating and mitigating circumstances and financial/socio-economic circumstances. Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is not an arithmetically precise exercise, and supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in this respect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e384.           The DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs, object to the level of the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision as they consider the proposed fine not effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article|\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|83(1) GDPR). These SAs argue that the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR are not weighed correctly by the LSA when calculating the administrative fines in the present case, in light of the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e385.           Specifically, the DE, FR, NL and NO SAs refer to the nature and gravity of the infringement and the number of data subjects concerned. The PL SA adds that the gravity of the infringement is compounded by the fact that the data processing is an essential part of Meta IE’s business model. The DE SAs also refer to the infringement’s duration and the negligence identified by the IE SA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e386.           The EDPB takes note Meta IE’s disagreement with the fine proposed by the IE SA and their view that any objections aiming to increase the quantum of fines are not compatible with Article 83 GDPR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e387.           The EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA indicates being satisfied the proposed fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive, taking into account all the circumstances of the IE SA’s inquiry. The IE SA assessed the different criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR in relation to the transparency infringements found. The IE SA considered the infringements as serious in nature, and in terms of gravity of the infringements found a significant level of noncompliance. Furthermore, the EDPB underlines that, as established by the IE SA, the infringements affect a significant number of data subjects and are extensive. The EDPB also observes that the infringements is considered negligent in character. Further, the IE SA considered the level of damage suffered by data subjects as being significant. In addition, the IE SA identifies only one mitigating factor, however without articulating the weight accorded to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e388.           Meta IE argues that reputation costs should also be taken into consideration, citing the IE SA’s remark on _“the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract”_. On principle, the EDPB agrees that reputation costs could be taken into consideration to some extent, if credible arguments are be put forward about the grave detriment that would ensue. Meta IE does not present such arguments. The EDPB is of the view that in this case other incentives would offset any reputational costs. As far as advertisers are concerned, Meta IE puts forward that “_[the] personalised nature of the Facebook Service is also the reason why it has been instrumental in the success of small and medium sized businesses (‘SMEs’) worldwide, including across the EU. Personalisation on the Facebook Service enables SMEs to compete for customers through ‘customizing products and services, [...] building a unique brand image, tailoring marketing to a specific audience and developing a strong one-to-one connection with a community of customers’_”. As far as users of the Facebook service are concerned, there are network effects at play which leads to incentives to join - or not leave - the platform, so as not to be excluded from participating in discussions, corresponding with and receiving information from others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e389.           The FR SA compares the proposed fine with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited for transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR). The FR SA also compares with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR). While the EDPB|\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR, the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the FR SA do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regard to the infringements involved. Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e390. The DE SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine range is about 0.05 % of the global annual turnover, which it notes is 80 times lower than the maximum ceiling provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR. For illustrative purposes, the DE SAs add that this upper limit would|   |   |   |   |\n|amount to a fine of||per person (on the basis of||data subjects affected|\n|according to paragraph 9.15 of the Draft Decision). Also illustrative is the amount of time, on average, it took Meta IE to generate 36 million euros in turnover in 2020, which was about 4 hours and 30 minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e391.        The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect. The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model, the risk of this occurring is all the greater. By bearing the cost the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e392.        Though the IE SA touches upon the notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in relation to the proposed fine, there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to explain the modest fine range chosen. Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR, the Draft Decision does not articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness. In this regard the EDPB recalls that the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned is considered for the calculation of the fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e393.        While a single mitigating factor identified by the IE SA is mentioned, there is no indication the weight that has been attributed to this factor in the context of the Article 83(2) assessment. As indicated above (see paragraph 366), the EDPB finds the Draft Decision does not sufficiently justify this mitigating factor, hence it should not be considered an aggravating or mitigating factor.|   |   |   |   |\n\n394. In light of the above, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.\n\n9.4        I have taken account of the above directions of the EDPB in the Article 83(2) assessments set out below. \n\n9.5 As noted earlier in this Decision, the EDPB, by way of the Article 65 Decision, has also directed me to find that Articles 6(1) and the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness have been infringed.  Pursuant to those determinations, the EDPB made further directions, as regards the imposition of additional administrative fines.  In relation to the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB directed, at paragraph 473 of the Article 65 Decision, that:\n\n_“Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringements as well as other aspects in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an additional administrative fine.”_\n\n9.6        At paragraph 509, the EDPB further directed that:\n\n_“The EDPB instructs the IE SA to cover the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR with an administrative fine that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR.”_\n\n9.7 As regards the manner in which I should assess the new infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB instructed as follows:\n\n441. The EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one. In the case at hand, however, the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in their objections. The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection.\n\n  \n\n|   |\n|---|\n|442.           Several of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e443.           As mentioned above and outlined below, the **nature and gravity of the infringement** clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e444.           With respect to the **scope of processing**, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that _“[Meta IE] processes a variety of data in order to serve users personalised advertisements, tailor their ‘News Feed’, and to provide feedback to advertising partners on the popularity of particular advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered”_.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e445.           In this respect, the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal data of a significant **number of people** and that the impact on them has to be considered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e446.           Though the **damage** is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that data subjects have been faced with data processing that should not have occurred (by relying inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis as established in section 4.4.2). The data processing in question - behavioural advertising - entails decisions about information that data subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “_where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data_”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b), a risk of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e447.           The SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be considered intentional on Meta IE’s part, which is an aggravating factor.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e448.           The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the aim to infringe the GDPR, nor was negligent - but “_has relied on what it has consistently considered in good faith to be a valid legal basis for the purpose of processing of personal data for behavioural advertising and which now requires escalation to the EDPB for resolution”_. Before addressing each of the elements of this claim, the EDPB first notes that establishing either intent or negligence is not a requirement for imposing a fine, but deserves ‘due regard’. Second, contrary to what Meta IE implies, the mere circumstance that a dispute between the LSA and the CSAs has escalated to the EDPB does not serve as evidence that a controller acted in good faith with respect to the disputed issues. First, the dispute arises only (long) after the controller has decided on its course of action, and therefore cannot inform it. Second, a dispute may simply bring to light that an LSA has decided to challenge a position commonly held by (a majority of) the CSAs.|\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|449.           The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the willfulness in relation to such act. By contrast, an infringement is “_unintentional”_ when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e450.           The characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis of objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case. It is worth noting the broader approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain degree of knowledge about a potential infringement. This provides an indication that non-compliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e451.           The SE SA argues that Meta IE “has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the aforementioned Guidelines [2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects] – which clearly gives doubt to the legality of the processing – which were first adopted on 9 April 2019 and made final on 8 October 2019. The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date.” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e452.           The EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption Guidelines 2/2019, there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in _WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising_, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive - is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application. Second, _WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e453.           It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement intentional, as stated above, since the “_aim”_ or “_wilfulness”_ of the action should be demonstrated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e454.           The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the “_will”_ to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the “_wilfulness”_ are considered two distinctive elements of the|\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|intentionality. While it may prove difficult to _demonstrate_ a subjective element such as the “_will”_ to act in a certain manner, there need to be some objective elements that _indicate_ the existence of such intentionality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e455.           The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “_serious negligence”_, rather than ‘_intentionality’_ when “_the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation”_. In this regard, the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place for the safeguard of personal data: this does not, however, per se change the nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e456.           In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that _“[the] proposed finding of infringement concerning information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, since it goes to show that Facebook was aware of the questionable legality of that basis and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects_”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e457.           The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Facebook Terms of Service as an objective element; however, this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations: in the EDPB’s view, the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient to indicate intention either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e458.           Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE to act in breach of the law, as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its legal obligations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e459.           Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SAs do not meet the threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e460.           At the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e461.           The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “_good faith_”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, following the adoption of Guidelines 2/2019 on 9 April 2019. Even before that date,|\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|the EDPB considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of _WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising_ and _WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests_ (see paragraphs 452 - 453 above)_,_ which mean Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the fact that processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The degree of responsibility of the controller taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e462.           The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regard to the transparency infringements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The manner in which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e463.           The DE SAs identify an aggravating factor in the fact that the “infringement became known by a complaint of a data subject, not by chance or report by the controller itself”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e464.           The EDPB considers that, as a rule, the circumstance that the infringement became known to the LSA by way of a complaint should be considered neutral. The DE SAs do not put forward reasons that would justify a departure from the rule in the present case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e465.           Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element as an aggravating or mitigating factor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e466.           The DE SAs and SE SA argue Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract as legal basis for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Facebook. The DE SAs engaged in a detailed calculation to justify their estimation of the benefit, although acknowledging it was based on assumptions. While not providing an estimate of its size, the SE SA considers the existence of financial benefit sufficiently proven on the basis of “_the self-evident fact that Facebook has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social media platform service, as opposed to establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear in the information to data subjects, it is a reasonable assumption that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to the processing, thus increasing the financial benefits gained by Facebook pursuant to personal advertisement_”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e467.           The EDPB recalls that financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e468.           In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.|\n\n  \n\n469.       Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.\n\n_The profitability of the undertaking - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)_\n\n470.       For the reasons stated above (paragraphs 378 - 381), the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element as aggravating or mitigating factor as put forward by the DE SAs.  \n\n_Competitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)_\n\n471.       The NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “that the unlawful processing of personal data in all likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual or societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to FIL. The algorithms may have contributed to giving FIL a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors”. \n\n472.       On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.\n\n***\n\n473.       Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency infringements relating to processing carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The EDPB underlines that, in order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, a fine should reflect the circumstances of the case. Such circumstances not only refer to the specific elements of the infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely its financial position.\n\n9.8               I have taken account of the above directions of the EDPB in the Article 83(2) assessments set out below.\n\n9.9               Finally, in relation to the new finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness that was established by the EDPB, the EDPB further directed that:\n\n477.       As previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent meaning. It underpins the whole data protection framework and plays a key role for securing a balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship.\n\n478.       Considering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements of the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects as to the processing of their personal data, fulfilling data subjects’ reasonable expectation, ensuring power balance, avoiding deception and ensuring ethical and truthful processing, as well as the overall effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB reiterates its view that Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into account by the IE SA in the calculation of the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed following the conclusion of this inquiry.\n\n479.       Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when, reassessing the administrative fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.\n\n9.10           For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission does not consider an additional fine for the breach of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness that was established by the Article 65 Decision to be an appropriate corrective measure.  The Commission notes, in this regard, that the EDPB’s finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle was largely based on the lack of transparency, as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Terms of Service (see, for example, paragraphs 226, 229 and 230 of the Article 65 Decision).  The Commission’s Draft Decision contains separately proposed findings of infringement of the transparency obligations set out in Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) and proposes to exercise corresponding corrective powers in the form of administrative fines and an order to bring processing into compliance.  In the circumstances, the imposition of a further fine for the finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle would risk punishing Facebook twice for the same wrongdoing.\n\n9.11           From the above starting points, the required assessments, for the purpose of Article 83(2), of the infringements that were found to have occurred elsewhere in this Decision are set out immediately below.\n\n**_Article 83(2)(a): the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them_**\n\n9.12           I note that Article 83(2)(a) GDPR requires consideration of the identified criterion by reference to “the infringement” as well as “the processing concerned”.  \n\n_The infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of transparency_\n\n9.13           Considering first the meaning of “infringement”, it is clear from Articles 83(3)-(5) GDPR, that “infringement” means an infringement of a provision of the GDPR. In the context of this Inquiry, I have made findings that reflect my view that Facebook infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR (“the **Transparency Infringements**”). Thus, “the infringement”, for the purpose of my corresponding assessment of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria, should be understood (depending on the context in which the term is used) as meaning an infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  While each is an individual “infringement” of the relevant provision, they all concern transparency and, by reason of their common nature and purpose, are likely to generate the same, or similar, outcomes in the context of some of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment criteria. Accordingly, and for ease of review, I will assess all three infringements simultaneously, by reference to the collective term “**Transparency Infringements**”, unless otherwise indicated to the contrary. \n\n9.14           The phrase “the processing concerned”, in the context of the Transparency Infringements, should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that Facebook carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which it indicated reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, including for the purposes of behavioural advertising[[200]](#_ftn200). The within Inquiry was based on an assessment of the extent to which Facebook complies with its transparency obligations in the context of a specific Complaint. The Inquiry examined, _inter alia_ the extent of the information Facebook provided to the Complainant about processing carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Given the generality of the Complaint and therefore the Inquiry, the precise parameters of this processing were not directly relevant to the factual analysis carried out. The phrase “the processing concerned”, in the context of the Transparency Infringements, therefore refers simply to the processing addressed in the Preliminary Draft Decision i.e. the processing carried out by Facebook for the purpose of delivering its Terms of Service, including processing personal data for behavioural advertising.  Notwithstanding the EDPB’s determination that Facebook is not permitted to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR when processing personal data for behavioural advertising purposes, I am required (by paragraph 353 of the Article 65 Decision) to retain the scope of the “processing concerned”, as set out above.\n\n_The infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR in the context of processing for behavioural advertising_\n\n9.15           In the context of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, the phrase “the processing concerned” should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that are carried out by Facebook for the purpose of behavioural advertising.\n\n9.16           From this starting point, I will now assess the Article 83(2)(a) criterion in light of the particular circumstances of the Inquiry.  I note, in this regard, that Article 83(2)(a) comprises the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement; the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned; the number of data subjects affected; and the level of damaged suffered by them; as follows:\n\nNature, gravity and duration of the infringement\n\n9.17           In terms of the **nature** of the **Transparency Infringements**, the proposed findings concern infringements of the data subject rights. As set out in the analysis of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR above, my view is that the right concerned – the right to information – is a cornerstone of the rights of the data subject. Indeed, the provision of the information concerned goes to the very heart of the fundamental right of the individual to protection of personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to share their personal data in a voluntary situation such as this. If the required information has not been provided, the data subject has been deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision as to whether they wish to use a service that involves the processing of their personal data and engages their associated rights.  Furthermore, the extent to which a data controller has complied with its transparency obligations has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the other data subject rights. If data subjects have not been provided with the prescribed information, they may be deprived of the knowledge they need in order to consider exercising one of the other data subject rights. \n\n9.18           I further note, in this regard, that Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR are directed to the maximum fine that may be imposed in a particular case. The maximum fine prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR is twice that prescribed by Article 83(4) GDPR. The infringements covered by Article 83(5) GDPR include infringements of the data subject’s rights pursuant to Article 12 to 22 GDPR and infringements of the principles in Article 5 GDPR. It is therefore clear that the legislator considered the data subject rights and the Article 5 GDPR principles to be particularly significant in the context of the data protection framework as a whole.\n\n9.19           Facebook has argued that the nature of the Transparency Infringements amount to a good faith difference of opinion, and present a new and subjective interpretation of the GDPR.[[201]](#_ftn201) As part of my assessment of the Article 83(2)(c) GDPR criterion, which requires consideration of “any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects”, I note that it would be unfair to criticize Facebook for failing to take action to mitigate any damage suffered in circumstances where its position was that no infringement had occurred and, accordingly, no damage had been suffered by data subjects. This does not, however, do anything to alter the infringement’s objectively serious character. \n\n9.20           In terms of the **nature** of the **Article 6(1) infringement** that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 441 of the Article 65 Decision provides that: \n\n_“The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection.”_\n\n9.21           In considering the nature and scope of the processing in the context of the analysis leading to the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) itself, the EDPB noted, at paragraphs 95 and 96 of the Article 65 Decision, that:\n\n_“… Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook social network service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device. According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way._\n\n_The EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service. These are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and expect behavioural advertising when they accept the Facebook Terms of Service and perceive it as necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service.”_\n\n9.22           With specific reference to the scope of the processing, paragraph 444 of the Article 65 Decision, provides that:\n\n“… _the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that “[Meta IE] processes a variety of data in order to serve users personalised advertisements, tailor their ‘News Feed’, and to provide feedback to advertising partners on the popularity of particular advertisements.  The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered_”\n\n9.23           It is therefore clear that the EDPB considers the Article 6(1) infringement to concern one of the “fundamental pillars” of the GDPR and the nature and scope of the processing to be extensive, complex, intrusive and on a massive scale.  The Commission further notes, in this regard, that paragraph 443 of the Article 65 Decision indicates that the EDPB considered the nature of the infringement to be significant, in the context of its conclusion that an administrative fine ought to be imposed in relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\n9.24           In terms of the **gravity** of the **Transparency Infringements**, my findings are such that Facebook has not provided the required information in the required manner under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and has also infringed Articles 12(1) and 5(1)(a) GDPR. This, in my view, represents a significant level of non-compliance, taking into account the importance of the right to information, the consequent impact on the data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects potentially affected (each of which is considered further below).  \n\n9.25           Facebook argues that the Transparency Infringements are on the lower end of the scale in their nature and gravity because the Commission’s interpretation amounts to new and subjective views being imposed on it.[[202]](#_ftn202) I do not accept that these views are new or subjective. I set out at Section 5 in great detail the extent to which this level of compliance is expected by the transparency guidelines, which are a publicly available document. The clear inconsistencies between the transparency guidelines and the manner in which Facebook attempted to comply with its obligations makes clear that the Commission’s interpretation is neither new nor subjective. The Commission is carrying out its functions under the GDPR, by interpreting and applying the relevant provisions of the GDPR to the Complaint before it.  Facebook also argues that no evidence has been presented of the impact on data subjects from a lack of transparency.[[203]](#_ftn203) On the contrary, this entire Complaint arises from a failure to provide sufficiently transparent information such that the Complainant could understand the agreement to the Terms of Service was not consent in the sense meant in the GDPR. Moreover, I have already set out in Section 5 the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective. This is more than sufficient to show the negative impact that this has had on data subjects and specifically on the Complainant. Given that this concerns a significant impact in the manner set out in this Decision, I cannot accept the suggestion from Facebook that the proposed administrative fine be replaced with a reprimand.[[204]](#_ftn204)\n\n9.26           In terms of the **gravity** of the **Article 6(1) infringement** that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision does not identify, with any particularisation, the EDPB’s position on the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement.  The Commission notes, however, that paragraph 443 of the Article 65 Decision indicates that the EDPB considered the gravity of the infringement to be significant, in the context of its conclusion that an administrative fine ought to be imposed in relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR:\n\n_“As mentioned above and outlined below, the nature and gravity of the infringement clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine.”_\n\n9.27           The Commission, for its part, notes that infringements of Article 6 are subject to the higher fining threshold set out in Article 83(5) GDPR.  The maximum fine prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR is twice that prescribed by Article 83(4) GDPR.  This arrangement clearly indicates that the legislator considered the matters covered by Article 83(5) GDPR to be particularly significant in the context of the data protection framework as a whole.\n\n9.28           In terms of the **duration** of the **Transparency Infringements**, this complaint-based Inquiry relates in part to a lack of information provided to the Complainant as regards the lawful basis relied on and the connection between Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and specific processing operations or sets of operations. The Complaint therefore relates to the transparency of the relevant documents at the time the Complaint was lodged. In that sense, this Inquiry relates to specific alleged infringements at a specific point in time, because that is what the Complaint concerns. In imposing corrective powers however, the GDPR requires that the broader impact of infringements be considered (as I will set out below in relation to each individual criterion). To that extent, it is necessary at times to move from the specific to the general. \n\n9.29           I note at this juncture that Facebook has taken issue with various alleged inconsistencies between the approach to factors considered in administrative fines in the Preliminary Draft Decision and in other decisions made by the Commission under the GDPR to date.[[205]](#_ftn205) The Commission does not agree that there is any inconsistency in the manner in which it has assessed the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria. The Commission is not required to apply the same approach across all inquiries, regardless of the differences between such inquiries. The Commission’s approach to the presence or absence of relevant previous infringements (for the purpose of the Article 83(2)(e) GDPR assessment) differs, depending _inter alia_ on the contexts of different types of controllers, particularly as concerns the scale of the processing at issue. Unlike the position with the smallerscale domestic inquiries to which Facebook refers, inquiries into larger internet platforms generally concern data controllers or processors with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams.\n\n9.30           Moreover, such entitles are further likely to be engaged in business activities that are uniquely dependent on the large-scale processing of personal data. The Commission’s view is that the size and scale of such entities, the level of dependency on data processing and the extensive resources that are available to them necessitate a different approach to the absence of previous relevant infringements. That approach has been reflected in the decisions that differ in their considerations of particular factors from this one. In the circumstances, the Commission does not accept that there has been an inconsistency in the Commission’s approach to determining the quantum of any fine.\n\n9.31           In relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision does not contain any indication in relation to the manner in which the EDPB took account of the duration of the Article 6(1) infringement.  The Commission notes that the infringement has occurred since 25 May 2018 and remains ongoing.\n\nTaking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned\n\n9.32           The personal data processing carried out by Facebook pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive. Facebook processes a variety of data in order to serve users personalised advertisements, tailor their “News Feed”, and to provide feedback to advertising partners on the popularity of particular advertisements.  The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered, and, for this reason, the provision of compliant information in relation to that processing becomes even more important. This, indeed, may include location and IP address data.\n\n9.33           The EDPB’s views, as regards the scope of the processing concerned, in the context of the Article 6(1) infringement have already been recorded at paragraph 9.21, above.\n\nThe number of data subjects affected\n\n9.34           In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I noted, in the Draft Decision, that Facebook has confirmed that, as of the date of the Complaint, it had approximately  monthly active users and that, as of May 2021, it had approximately  monthly active users in the European Economic Area.[[206]](#_ftn206)\n\n9.35           Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union confirms that, as of 1 January 2020, the population of the “”EU 27” was approximately 488 million, the population of the UK was approximately 67 million, the population of Norway was approximately 5 million, and the populations of Iceland and Liechtenstein were approximately 364,000 and 39,000 respectively.[[207]](#_ftn207)\n\n9.36           By reference to these figures, the total population of the EEA (including the UK) by reference to the latest available figures is approximately 520 million. While it is not possible, or indeed necessary, for me to identify the precise number of users affected by the Infringements, it is useful to have some point of reference in order to consider the extent of EEA data subjects that are potentially affected by the Infringements. The figures available for Facebook equates to approximately  of the population of the EEA (including the UK), by reference to the Eurostat figures above.\n\n9.37           In relation to the finding of **infringement of Article 6(1)** GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 445 of the Article 65 Decision recalls, by reference to the assessment recorded immediately above, that “_the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal data of a significant number of people_”.  Footnote 886 (to paragraph 445 of the Article 65 Decision) further references paragraph 9.17 of the Commission’s Draft Decision, with the EDPB noting that this figure “amounts to roughly  of the population [of the EEA, including the UK].”\n\nThe level of damage suffered by them\n\n9.38           In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I note that Recital 75 (which acts as an aid to the interpretation of Article 24 GDPR, the provision that addresses the responsibility of the controller), describes the “damage” that can result where processing does not accord with the requirements of the GDPR: \n\n“_The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material or nonmaterial damage, in particular: … where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data_ …”\n\n9.39           As set out above, my findings are such that users have not been provided with the information in relation to processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR that they are entitled to receive. This represents, in my view, quite a significant information deficit and one which, by any assessment of matters, can equate to a significant inability to exercise control over personal data. I have also pointed out the centrality of the processing to Facebook’s business model. This makes it all the more important that information on this processing be provided in a transparent manner, and makes the implications of it not being provided in such a manner all the more significant.\n\n9.40           I further note that the failure to provide all of the prescribed information undermines the effectiveness of the data subject rights and, consequently, infringes the rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned. A core element of transparency is empowering data subjects to make informed decisions about engaging with activities that cause their personal data to be processed, and making informed decisions about whether to exercise particular rights, and whether they can. This right is undermined by a lack of transparency on the part of a data controller.\n\n9.41           Facebook argues that the above amounts to mere speculation.[[208]](#_ftn208) I have already set out in detail in this Decision the risks to data subject rights involved in the denial of transparency, and indeed provided the concrete example of the breach of the Complainant’s rights to transparency about the use of her personal data. This is more than sufficient to show that rights have been damaged in a significant manner, given the lack of an opportunity to exercise data subject rights while being fully informed.\n\n9.42           In the context of the infringement **of the infringement of Article 6(1)** GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 446 of the Article 65 Decision records that:\n\n_“Though the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that data subjects have been faced with data processing that should not have occurred … .  The data processing in question – behavioural advertising – entails decisions about information that data subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving.  The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data”.  Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, a risk of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself.”_\n\n9.43           Paragraph 129 of the Article 65 Decision considers the risks arising from the Article 6(1) infringement as follows:\n\n_“Given that the main purpose for which a user uses the Facebook service is to communicate with others, and that Meta IE conditions its use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the behavioural advertising it includes, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue. The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 7 GDPR and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.”_\n\n9.44           The EDPB further considered, at paragraph 131 of the Article 65 Decision, that:\n\n_“Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis, instead of others such as consent 6(1)(a) GDPR and legitimate interest 6(1)(f) GDPR, are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). As a result, owing to the number of users, market power, and influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive business model, the risks derived from the current findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the Complainant and the millions of users of Facebook service in the EEA and affect the protection of the hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR.”_\n\n9.45           It therefore appears that the EDPB considered the infringement to give rise to a risk of loss of control over, and ability to exercise choice concerning, one’s personal data.  This is consistent with the Complainant’s position that the infringement had the effect of negating her free will (see point ii, page 17 of the Complaint).\n\n9.46           The Commission considers that the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle may be taken into account, as required by the Article 65 Decision, under this particular heading.  The Commission notes, in this regard, paragraph 224 of the Article 65 Decision, which records the EDPB’s view that:\n\n_“Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is particularly important to ensure that data subjects are protected from any form of abuse and deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal data.  Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into account the particular service that is being provided and the characteristics of their users, serves as a shield from the danger of abuse and deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries.”_\n\n9.47           The EDPB further notes, at paragraphs 229 and 230 of the Article 65 Decision, that:\n\n_“… the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Facebook users are left ”in the dark\" and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, which ultimately restricts the Facebook users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights._\n\n_… Considering the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Facebook users in a misleading manner, which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights.”_\n\n9.48           The EDPB’s views highlight the same damage as already identified above, namely the loss of control over, and ability to exercise choice concerning, one’s personal data.\n\n9.49           On the basis of the views that have been expressed by the EDPB, as recorded above, I conclude that the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR falls within the upper range of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of the assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion.  By way of its Final Submissions, Facebook expressed its disagreement with this proposed conclusion and the underlying assessments set out above. \n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.50           Following the amendment of the Draft Decision to take account of the EDPB’s Article 65 Decision, Facebook was invited to exercise its right to be heard in relation to those aspects of the Draft Decision in relation to which the Commission was required to make a final determination or, otherwise, to exercise its discretion.  Facebook furnished its submissions on these matters under cover of letter dated 19 December 2022 (“the **Final Submissions**”).\n\n9.51           In relation to the **nature** of the Article 6(1) infringement, Facebook submitted[[209]](#_ftn209) that the EDPB’s conclusion on this aspect of matters “_is not correct and not supported by the evidence, particularly where (i) the [Commission] itself found [Facebook’s] reliance on Article 6(1)(b) for [behavioural advertising purposes] valid in principle, meaning the infringement cannot be said to have been “clear”; and (ii) the Article 65 Decision acknowledges that legal bases are available [to support processing for behavioural advertising] and that there is no hierarchy between those legal bases_.”  In this regard, Facebook respectfully urges the Commission not to adopt the EDPB’s “flawed arguments” with respect to Article 83(2)(a) in light of a number of “significant errors in the EDPB’s reasoning” that it has identified in its Final Submissions.  \n\n9.52           In circumstances where the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission, I am not in a position to act contrary to, or otherwise look behind, the views that have been so expressed the EDPB.\n\n9.53           In relation to the **gravity** of the Article 6(1) infringement, Facebook, firstly, noted that the Article 65 Decision does not articulate any clear reasoning or position with respect to the gravity of the purported infringement, rendering the assessment of this element meaningless.  Facebook has further submitted[[210]](#_ftn210) that a _“finding in respect of gravity cannot simply be extrapolated from the fact that the infringement found is subject to a particular fining cap in accordance with Article 83(5), with no reference to the facts_.”  Facebook submitted that gravity should not be considered significant or an aggravating factor for the same reasons as those provided in response to the proposed assessment of the nature of the assessment, as summarised above.  \n\n9.54           As before, the Commission is not in a position to act contrary to the views that have been clearly expressed by the EDPB in its binding Article 65 Decision.  As already acknowledged, the EDPB has not elaborated on the reasons why it considers the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement to be one of the factors that tip the balance in favour of the imposition of a fine.  This does not alter the fact, however, that the EDPB clearly considered the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement to be of one of the factors that warranted the imposition of an administrative fine.  In these circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to conclude that the gravity of the infringement is not significant, in terms of its impact on the overall assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion.\n\n9.55           In relation to the **duration** of the Article 6(1) infringement, Facebook has submitted[[211]](#_ftn211) that the duration of the alleged infringement “_should not be considered an aggravating factor in this particular case_”.  In the absence of any specific direction from the EDPB, in this regard, the Commission has not treated this factor as being significant, in terms of its impact on the overall assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion.\n\n9.56           In relation to the **number of data subjects** and the **level of damage suffered** by them, Facebook has submitted[[212]](#_ftn212) that:\n\n•       “_the only data subject who is relevant for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) is the data subject represented by the Complainant and any consideration of the level of damage suffered is confined to a consideration of any damage the Complainant may have suffered.  No evidence of any such damage has been adduced in the Inquiry_”; \n\n•       “_even if it is open to the [Commission] to consider whether other data subjects have been affected and to have regard to any damage suffered by them, there is no evidence whatsoever in this Inquiry that any other data subjects have suffered any damage_.”\n\n•       “_the [Commission’s] assessment of whether damage has been suffered for the purposes of_\n\n_Article 83(2)(a) must be based on evidence of damage stemming from the specific infringement in question (here, the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement).  It is not permissible for the DPC to assume that the Complainant has suffered damage or to base the calculation of_ _the proposed Article 6(1) fine on “the same damage as already identified” as the basis for the purposed Article 5(1)(a) fine._”\n\n•       “_an alleged “loss of control” should not be equated with damage within the meaning of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR_”; \n\n•       There is no factual or evidential basis to support an assertion that users experienced a “loss of control”.  “_This is especially true considering that everyone has a choice as to whether they wish to use the Facebook Service in the first place and can always deactivate their accounts_.”\n\n9.57           In response to the above submissions, it is, firstly, important to note that the Commission is subject to a binding decision of the EDPB, which includes an assessment of the damage suffered by data subjects, at paragraph 446 thereof.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to find that no damage has been suffered.  Secondly, the Complainant herself identified the damage that she alleges to have suffered in connection with the matters which formed the basis for the EDPB’s findings of infringement of Article 6(1) and the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.  Thirdly, as regards the damage suffered by data subjects other than the Complainant, the matters covered by the findings of infringement are not matters on which any individual user of the Facebook Service has the power to exercise choice (other than, of course, the choice to use the Facebook Service or not).  Where any individual data subject chooses to use the Facebook Service, the basic processing that takes place (the subject of the within Inquiry) is the same as that applied to the personal data of the Complainant.  In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the identified damage suffered, i.e. loss of control over one’s personal data, is limited to the Complainant alone.  For these reasons, it is appropriate for the Commission to take account of the damage suffered by all user data subjects as part of the Article 83(2) assessment.\n\n9.58           Having taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the view that the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR falls within the upper range of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of the assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(B): THE INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT CHARACTER OF THE INFRINGEMENT\n\n9.59 In assessing the character of the **Transparency Infringements**, I note that the GDPR does not identify the factors that need to be present in order for an infringement to be classified as either “intentional” or “negligent”. The Article 29 Working Party considered this aspect of matters in its “Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679” as follows:\n\n“_In general, “intent” includes both knowledge and wilfulness in relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas “unintentional” means that there was no intention to cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the law._”[[213]](#_ftn213)\n\n9.60 The Administrative Fines Guidelines go on to distinguish between circumstances that are indicative of ‘intentional breaches’ and those that are indicative of breaches occasioned by unintentional, or negligent, conduct. In this regard, the Guidelines cite “_failure to read and abide by existing_ _policies_” and “_human error_” as being examples of conduct that may be indicative of negligence.\n\n9.61 The Complainant has clearly asserted that the alleged infringements on Facebook’s part were intentional acts. Moreover, she states that the character of the infringement is that it was a decision made knowingly to present information in a particular way. Facebook is however entitled to a hold differing position in relation to the interpretation of particular provisions of the GDPR. While Facebook may have believed that it was in compliance with the GDPR, it is my view that the Transparency Infringements arose out of a deliberate decision. It is important that Facebook provides clarity about the precise extent of the processing operations carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and that it adheres strictly to its transparency obligations when choosing the lawful bases on which they rely. \n\n9.62 Facebook cites the above passage from the Fining Guidelines to support its position that “intention” refers to a deliberate breach of the GDPR rather than a deliberate act.[[214]](#_ftn214) I note in this regard that the Fining Guidelines refer to two requirements, “knowledge” and “wilfulness”. This suggests a controller must infringe the GDPR both in full knowledge of the infringement’s characteristics and also in a deliberate manner. Having considered the nature of the infringements further in the context of the Fining Guidelines, I accept Facebook’s submissions that any intentional breach must be an intentional and knowing breach of a provision of the GDPR. There is no evidence that this has taken place.\n\n9.63 Facebook also argues that even if the position on the definition of intent is accepted, what occurred was not a deliberate act but an omission.[[215]](#_ftn215) In light of my finding in the above paragraph it is unnecessary to consider this submission.\n\n9.64 I am therefore satisfied that the failure to provide the requisite information was negligent in character. Facebook is under a clear legal duty to correctly apply the law and it has not done so.\n\nThis amounts to a breach of the duty imposed by the provisions of the GDPR, and is on that basis a negligent infringement.\n\n9.65 In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, paragraphs 449 to 461, inclusive, of the Article 65 Decision record as follows:\n\n_“The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the wilfulness in relation to such act.  By contrast, an infringement is “unintentional” when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement._\n\n_The characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis of objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case.  It is worth noting the broader approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain degree of knowledge about a potential infringement.  This provides an indication that non-compliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence.”_\n\n_…_\n\n_The EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption [of] Guidelines 2/2019, there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis.  First, in WP29 Opinion 01/2010 on online behavioural advertising, only consent – as required by Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive – is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity.  As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application.  Second, WP Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”_ \n\n_It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated._\n\n_The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the “will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the_\n\n|   |\n|---|\n|_knowledge and the “wilfulness” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality.  While it may prove difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional.  In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”, rather than ‘intentionality’ when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation”.  In this regard, the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place for the safeguard of personal data: this does not, however, per se change the nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that “[the] proposed finding of infringement concerning information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, since it goes to show that Facebook was aware of the questionable legality of that basis and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects”._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Facebook Terms of Service as an objective element; however, this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations: in the EDPB’s view, the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient to indicate intention either._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE to act in breach of the law, as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its legal obligations._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SAs do not meet the threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_At the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR._\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, following the adoption of Guidelines 2/2019 on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB_|\n\n_considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests … , which mean Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the fact that processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation.”_\n\n9.66 As set out above, the EDPB determined the Article 6(1) infringement to be “seriously negligent” in character.  In the circumstances, I proposed to treat this factor as an aggravating factor of significant weight.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.67 Facebook disagrees[[216]](#_ftn216) with the above conclusion on the basis of a range of submissions, all of which challenge the basis for the EDPB’s conclusion.  Facebook submits that the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR can “_at most be considered inadvertent, such that this should not be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of Article 83(2)._”  In the alternative, Facebook has submitted that the Commission should not afford any material weight to this factor in light of its “_good faith reliance on what it considered to be a valid legal basis, (b) the errors in the reasoning of the EDPB [as identified]; and (c) the lack of legal certainty in the interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR_.”\n\n9.68 As already noted, above, the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to disregard the views that have been clearly expressed by the EDPB, in relation to the character of the Article 6(1) infringement.  In circumstances where the EDPB has determined the Article 6(1)(b) infringement to be “seriously negligent” in character, I remain of the view that this requires me to treat this factor as an aggravating factor of significant weight, notwithstanding Facebook’s Final Submissions on the point.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(C): ANY ACTION TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO DATA SUBJECTS\n\n9.69 Facebook’s position is that its approach to transparency, in the context in which **the Transparency Infringements** have been found, complies fully with the GDPR. Notwithstanding my proposed disagreement with this position, I accept that it represents a genuinely held belief on Facebook’s part. This does not alter the fact that infringements have occurred. On that basis, there has been no effort to mitigate the damage to data subjects, given Facebook’s position was that no damage was taking place.  \n\n9.70 Facebook argues that this analysis is flawed because it takes no account of the effort made to comply with the GDPR. There is no reason why, on the basis of Transparency Guidelines, Facebook could not have taken steps to ensure compliance and thereby mitigate damage. I am not satisfied that there is any reason why day-to-day compliance related activities in a large multinational organisation, which is an important legal duty and commonplace business activity, could be considered a mitigating factor. Taking steps to attempt to comply with legal obligations is a duty, and has no mitigating impact on a sanction for a breach of those obligations. This is distinct from any act that might be taken to mitigate specific damage to data subjects. I am not of course treating this factor as aggravating given that, beyond simply complying with the GDPR, there are no obvious mitigating steps that could have been taken. It is on this basis that I treat this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n\n9.71 By way of the Draft Decision, I proposed to take account of and acknowledge, as a mitigating factor, Facebook’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the conclusion of this Inquiry. Further, however, to an objection raised by the Polish SA, during the Article 60 consultation period, the EDPB determined, in paragraphs 362 to 366 of the Article 65 Decision, as follows:\n\n363.       The IE SA states that “_[Meta IE]’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis_” should be understood as actions taken to mitigate the damage to data subjects, distinct from actions taken to comply685. In the present case, the EDPB fails to see how such a distinction can be made. Additionally, drawing this distinction seems inconsistent with the IE SA’s position that the negative impact on data subjects lies precisely in the transparency infringements and thus in the “_the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective_”686. In other words, the damage caused to data subjects is, in these circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself687. \n\n364.       In addition, the EDPB agrees with the PL SA that the expression of an “_intention to bring the processing operations into the compliance with the provisions of GDPR_” as such cannot serve as evidence of actions already taken to mitigate damage suffered. In order for this element to serve as a mitigating factor, further evidence would be necessary for instance demonstrating that the controller did whatever they could in order to reduce the consequences of the breach for the individuals concerned688. \n\n365.       The EDPB agrees with the IE SA that “_[taking] steps to attempt to comply with legal obligations is a duty, and has no mitigating impact on a sanction for a breach of those obligations_”. In any case, Meta IE’s “_decision to begin preparation for voluntary compliance on the basis of the views set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision_” is merely a first step of a longer process towards full compliance with the GDPR. The information available in the file does not include indications that the actions taken by the controller have gone beyond willingness to prepare to change its practices in case this appeared necessary. \n\n366.       The EDPB finds the IE SA does not provide sufficient justification for the mitigating factor identified, and instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision on this matter, by considering this factor as neither aggravating nor mitigating.  \n\n9.72           On the basis of the above, and in accordance with the instruction of the EDPB, the Commission treats this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n9.73           In relation to the **infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, this aspect of the Article 83(2) assessment has not been addressed in the Article 65 Decision.  I note that Facebook, throughout the course of the Inquiry, considered that it was entitled to process personal data for behavioural advertising purposes, insofar as that formed a core part of the Facebook Terms of Service, in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  That being the case, it follows that Facebook could not have been expected to take action “to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects” in circumstances where it did not consider any infringement to have occurred or any damage to have been suffered by data subjects.  In the circumstances, the Commission proposed to consider this factor to be neither aggravating nor mitigating.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.74           By way of the Final Submissions, Facebook has urged me to take account of various mitigating matters such as the absence of evidence of harm and the fact that various voluntary steps have been taken to improve transparency for users since the Inquiry has commenced, including as recently as July 2022.  I note that I have already addressed Facebook’s submissions concerning the absence of evidence of harm, as part of the Article 83(2)(a) assessment.  In relation to the voluntary changes that have been made since the date of circulation, to the CSAs, of the Draft Decision, the Commission is unable to give credit to these changes, as a mitigating factor, without an assessment of the changes themselves.  Given that such an assessment is not possible within the temporal scope of the within Inquiry, the Commission is unable to treat this matter as a mitigating factor.  Accordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither aggravating nor mitigating.   \n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(D): THE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THEM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES 25 AND 32\n\n9.75      The Fining Guidelines set out that:\n\n“_The question that the supervisory authority must then answer is to what extent the controller “did what it could be expected to do” given the nature, the purposes or the size of the processing, seen in light of the obligations imposed on them by the Regulation._”\n\n9.76 In relation to Facebook’s responsibility from a technical and organisational perspective, Facebook has argued that, given it did not deliberately and knowingly break the law. It could not be said to have responsibility “_at the highest level_”.[[217]](#_ftn217) While I accepted this argument and revised my provisional view as a consequence, I nonetheless consider that Facebook’s responsibility is certainly at a high level.\n\n9.77 In this regard, I once again emphasise that the position as implemented represented a genuinely held belief, and the modes of implementation of compliance utilised by Facebook in this regard constituted a genuine effort to implement compliance based on this genuinely held belief. This genuine effort, however, has ultimately fallen short in terms of compliance in significant respects. I have found that it concerns serious data processing, and that it was deliberate act, in spite of the genuinely help belief that the modes of implementation were compliant. The degree of responsibility on Facebook’s part is therefore, in my view, responsibility of a high level.\n\n9.78      In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 462 of the Article 65 Decision provides that:\n\n_“The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same grounds as set [out] in the Draft Decision with regard to the transparency infringements.”_\n\n9.79 In the circumstances, the Commission proposed to consider this to be an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.80 By way of the Final Submissions, Facebook disagreed[[218]](#_ftn218) with the above assessment on the basis that “_the EDPB’s conclusion at para. 462 of the Article 65 Decision that [Facebook] had a “high degree” of responsibility pursuant to this factor is based on an incomplete analysis and the EDPB fails to consider any of the relevant subfactors set forth by the Article 29 Working Party Draft Administrative Fine Guidelines in reaching its conclusion.”_\n\n9.81 As already noted above, the EDPB’s Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, the Commission is not permitted to look behind the EDPB’s views and determinations.  In the circumstances, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight, notwithstanding Facebook’s Final Submissions.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(E): ANY RELEVANT PREVIOUS INFRINGEMENTS BY THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR\n\n9.82 In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I noted that there have been no relevant previous infringements by Facebook of the GDPR in this regard on which findings have been made. Facebook once again compares the lack of mitigation in this regard to a decision of the Commission on a domestic matter.[[219]](#_ftn219) I have already set out my views on these arguments above. Further, the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria are matters that I must consider when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and, if so, the amount of that fine. The Article 83(2) GDPR criteria are not binary in nature, such that, when assessed in the context of the circumstances of infringement, they must be found to be either a mitigating or an aggravating factor.\n\n9.83 Accordingly, it does not follow that the absence of a history of infringement must be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This is particularly the case where the GDPR has only been in force for a relatively short period of time. On this basis, my view is that this is neither a mitigating factor nor an aggravating one for the purpose of this assessment.\n\n9.84 In relation to the **infringement of Article 6(1)** that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  As at the date of circulation of the Commission’s Draft Decision, were there no relevant previous infringements by Meta IE that fell to be considered under this particular heading.  In the circumstances, I proposed to consider this factor to be neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.85 Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions[[220]](#_ftn220), disagrees with the above and, instead, urges the\n\nCommission to treat this factor as mitigating, in line with the Commission’s approach in other (named) inquiries.  I note, in this regard, that the named inquiries do not concern cross-border processing.  \n\n9.86 In response to the above, the Commission is not required to apply the same approach across all of its inquiries.  The Commission’s approach to the presence or absence of relevant previous infringements (for the purpose of the Article 83(2)(e) assessment) differs, depending _inter alia_ on the contexts of different types of controllers and, in particular, the scale of the processing at issue.  Unlike the position with the smaller-scale domestic inquiries that Facebook has cited as examples, inquiries into larger internet platforms generally concern data controllers or processors with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams.  Such entitles are further likely to be engaged in business activities that are\n\nuniquely dependent on the large-scale processing of personal data.  The Commission’s view is that the size and scale of such entities, the level of dependency on data processing and the extensive resources that are available to them necessitate a different approach to the absence of previous relevant infringements.  That approach has been reflected in the decisions that have been cited by Facebook in support of its submission. I note, in this regard, that Facebook’s submissions do not reference the Commission’s decision in the Twitter (breach notification) inquiry, nor the Commission’s decision in the WhatsApp (own volition) transparency inquiry, nor the Facebook (12 breaches) inquiry.  The Commission’s approach to the Article 83(2) assessment, as recorded in these decisions (amongst others), is consistent with that applied to the within inquiry.  Accordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(F): THE DEGREE OF COOPERATION WITH THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY, IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE INFRINGEMENT AND MITIGATE THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE INFRINGEMENT\n\n9.87      The Fining Guidelines state that:\n\n“… _it would not be appropriate to give additional regard to cooperation that is already required by law for example, the entity is in any case required to allow the supervisory authority access to premises for audits/inspection._”\n\n9.88 In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, Facebook argues that cooperation in this matter should be treated as a mitigating factor and again cites a decision of the Commission.[[221]](#_ftn221) I once again refer to my analysis on that issue above. Furthermore, I cannot accept that such activity, in the ordinary course of adhering to legal duties to cooperate and engage with a regulator, could be found to be a mitigating factor in a sanction. If this were the case, all controllers would get the benefit of such a mitigating factor aside from those that did not actively behave in an uncooperative manner. This position reflects the erroneous treatment of the Article 83(2) GDPR factors as binary choices between mitigation and aggravation to which I have already referred. \n\n9.89 For these reasons, while Facebook has cooperated fully with the Commission at all stages of the Inquiry, it is required to do so by law. Furthermore, I note that the cooperation that would be relevant to the assessment of this criterion is cooperation “_in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement_”.  In the circumstances, and in light of my views set out above, nothing arises for assessment by reference to this criterion.\n\n9.90                In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, the Article\n\n65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  In the circumstances, the Commission proposes to consider this factor to be neither mitigating nor aggravating for the same reasons set out in the Article 83(2)(c) assessment, above.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.91 By way of the Final Submissions, Facebook has submitted[[222]](#_ftn222) that I should treat this factor as mitigating in light of the fact that it has taken “_various voluntary steps to improve transparency for its users (which the EDPB considers underpins the alleged Article 6(1) infringement) throughout the course of the Inquiry … and will undertake all efforts to comply with any order issued by the [Commission], as required_.”  Facebook further submits that it has cooperated fully with the Commission throughout the Inquiry.\n\n9.92 I have already addressed the reasons why I cannot take account, as a mitigating factor, of any voluntary steps taken by Facebook following the date of circulation of the Draft Decision to the CSAs (the steps taken before that date having been deemed, by the EDPB, to be insufficient to be treated as a mitigating factor).  While the Commission recognises that Facebook has cooperated fully throughout the Inquiry, the Commission notes that Facebook is obliged to do so by virtue of Article 31 GDPR.  Furthermore, and while the Commission acknowledges Facebook’s commitment to undertake “all efforts to comply with any order” that might be issued further to this Decision, I again note that Facebook is subject to an obligation to comply with the terms of the relevant order.  In the circumstances, I am unable to take account of such matters as mitigating factors.\n\n9.93      Accordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(G): THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA AFFECTED BY THE INFRINGEMENT\n\n9.94 In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I noted that the lack of transparency concerned broad categories of personal data relating to users who sign up to the service. I have set out several times in this Decision that the assessment of data processing in this Inquiry was, by its nature, rather generalised. Indeed, the lack of transparency on Facebook’s part has itself contributed to a lack of clarity on precisely what categories of personal data are involved. I therefore agree with Facebook’s submission that this is not an aggravating factor,249 and I also do not regard it as a mitigating one.\n\n9.95 In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  The Commission notes, however,\n\nthe “relevant facts” identified by the EDPB in paragraphs 95 and 96 of the Article 65 Decision, including in relation to the personal data concerned, as follows:\n\n_“… Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook social network service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device.  According to the description provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and present situation.  This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location.”_\n\n9.96 While, as noted already in the Commission’s Draft Decision, it was neither necessary, for the purpose of the examination of the Complaint, nor possible, from an examination of the relevant privacy material, to identify the particular categories of personal data undergoing processing, it seems clear that the EDPB considered the processing to concern a broad range of categories of personal data.  Given the nature of behavioural advertising, it appears to be beyond dispute that the processing of a broad range of personal data is required to be carried out to achieve the objectives of behavioural advertising.  In the circumstances, I proposed to consider to consider this to be an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n\n9.97 By way of the Final Submissions, Facebook submits[[223]](#_ftn223) that this factor should be treated neutrally in circumstances where the views of the EDPB that form the basis for the Commission’s assessment under this heading rely, in turn, on “_descriptions of processing that are inaccurate and outside the scope of the Inquiry …_”.  \n\n9.98 As already outlined above, the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, it is not open to the Commission to revisit or otherwise look behind the views expressed, and determinations made, by the EDPB.  In the circumstances, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(H): THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INFRINGEMENT BECAME KNOWN TO THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY, IN PARTICULAR WHETHER, AND IF SO TO WHAT EXTENT, THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR NOTIFIED THE INFRINGEMENT\n\n9.99 In the context of the Transparency Infringements, I noted that the subject matter became known to the Commission due to an Inquiry conducted on foot of the Complaint. The subject matter did not give rise to any requirement of notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief is that no infringement is/was occurring.\n\n9.100 In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 465 of the EDPB Decision records the EDPB’s view that: “_the Draft Decision does not need to include this element as an aggravating or mitigating factor_.”  Accordingly, I proposed to consider this factor this factor to be neither mitigating nor aggravating.  Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions, confirmed[[224]](#_ftn224) its agreement with the above approach.  In the circumstances, I conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(I): WHERE MEASURES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 58(2) HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ORDERED AGAINST THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR CONCERNED WITH REGARD TO THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER, COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE MEASURES\n\n9.101 In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I concluded that this criterion is not applicable.\n\n9.102 In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  The Commission notes that measures have not previously been ordered against Facebook with regard to the same subject matter.  In the circumstances, the Commission proposes to consider this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating.  Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions, confirmed[[225]](#_ftn225) its agreement with the above approach.  In the circumstances, I conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(J): ADHERENCE TO APPROVED CODES OF CONDUCT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 40 OR APPROVED CERTIFICATION MECHANISMS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 42\n\n9.103 In the context of **the Transparency Infringements**, I concluded that this criterion is not applicable.\n\n9.104 In relation to **the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  The Commission proposes to consider this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating in circumstances where nothing arises for assessment under this heading.  Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions, confirmed[[226]](#_ftn226) its agreement with the above approach.  In the circumstances, I conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating.\n\n  \n\n## ARTICLE 83(2)(K): ANY OTHER AGGRAVATING OR MITIGATING FACTOR APPLICABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, SUCH AS FINANCIAL BENEFITS GAINED, OR LOSSES AVOIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE INFRINGEMENT\n\n9.105 In the Preliminary Draft Decision I considered the following factors in the context of **the Transparency Infringements**:\n\n•       Facebook does not charge for its service.\n\n•       The subject matter of the infringements relate directly to the provision of information in relation to what is, by Facebook’s own admission, its core business model i.e. personalised advertising provided pursuant to a contract with users.\n\n•       The question is therefore whether a more transparent approach to processing operations carried out on foot of that contract would represent a risk to Facebook’s business model. In my l view it would, if existing or prospective users were dissuaded from using the service by clearer explanations of the processing operations carried out, and their purposes. \n\n•       In my view the above risk is sufficiently high to justify the conclusion that this lack of transparency has the potential to have resulted in financial benefits for Facebook.\n\n9.106        Facebook however argues that this does not at all propose a financial risk, and argues that no evidence of same has been presented.[[227]](#_ftn227) Neither I nor Facebook can know, until the contingent event has happened, which one of us is correct in our belief as to the likely impact, on the continued growth of the user base. Given that any general consideration of this is ultimately involves an element of speculation on both Facebook’s and the Commission’s part, I considered, in the Draft Decision, that this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating.  \n\n9.107        Following the circulation of the Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned for the purpose of enabling them to share their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, an objection was raised on behalf of supervisory authorities of Germany, concerning this aspect of matters.  \n\n9.108        Having considered the merits of the objection, the EDPB, by way of paragraph 377 of the Article 65 Decision, instructed the Commission to:\n\n“_ascertain if further estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement of transparency obligations is possible in this case.  Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed_.”\n\n9.109        As recognised by the EDPB, at paragraph 370 of the Article 65 Decision, the Commission is required to “assess all the fact of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified.”  Despite specific requests made by the Commission during the course of the Article 65 deliberations, no directions have been provided by the EDPB, in its Article 65 Decision, as to the manner in which the Commission might seek to ascertain, on an objectively justifiable basis, an estimation of the financial benefit gained from an infringement such as the one under assessment.  In the absence of directions, the Commission is unable to ascertain an estimation of the matters identified above.\n\n9.110        The Commission separately notes, under this heading, the EDPB’s view, as set out in the EDPB’s Binding Decision 1/2021[[228]](#_ftn228) (paragraphs 409 to 412, inclusive), that the turnover of the undertaking concerned ought to be taken into account not just for the calculation of the applicable fining “cap” but also for the purpose of assessing the quantum of the administrative fine itself.  This position is further reflected in the Fining Guidelines 04/2022 (see, for example, paragraph 49).  The EDPB, by way of paragraph 393 of the Article 65 Decision, reiterated this position and instructed the Commission to “_elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned is considered for the calculation of the fine_.”\n\n9.111        The Commission’s assessment of the undertaking concerned and the applicable turnover figure is detailed further, below.  While this is not a matter that can properly be classified as either mitigating or aggravating, by reference to the circumstances of the case, the Commission has taken the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned into account when determining the quantum of the proposed fine, as set out below.\n\n9.112        In relation to the finding **of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR** that was established by the EDPB, paragraphs 467 to 469 of the Article 65 Decision records the EDPB’s views that, for the purpose of the Article 83(2)(k) assessment:\n\n_“The EDPB recalls that financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR._\n\n_In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement._\n\n_Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.”_\n\n9.113        In a similar vein, the EDPB, at paragraph 472 of the Article 65 Decision, expressed the view that:\n\n_“On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR908. In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.”_\n\n9.114        Despite specific requests made by the Commission, during the course of the Article 65 deliberations, no directions have been provided by the EDPB, in its Article 65 Decision, as to the manner in which the Commission might seek to ascertain an estimation of: (i) the financial benefit gained from an infringement such as the one under assessment; or (ii) the competitive advantage derived from the infringement.  I note, in this regard, the views previously expressed by the EDPB[[229]](#_ftn229) that:\n\n_“… when deciding on the imposition of corrective measures in general, and fines in particular, “supervisory authorities must assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified.”_\n\n9.115        In the absence of directions, the Commission is unable to ascertain an estimation of the matters identified above.  Accordingly, I am unable to take these matters into account for the purpose of this assessment.\n\n9.116        As before, the Commission separately notes, under this heading, the EDPB’s view, as set out in the EDPB’s binding decision 1/2021[[230]](#_ftn230), that the turnover of the undertaking concerned ought to be taken into account not just for the calculation of the applicable fining “cap” but also for the purpose of assessing the quantum of the administrative fine itself.  This position is further reflected in the Fining Guidelines 04/2022 (see, for example, paragraph 49 thereof).  The Commission’s assessment of the undertaking concerned and the applicable turnover figure is detailed further below in this Decision.  While this is not a matter that can properly be classified\n\nas either mitigating or aggravating, by reference to the circumstances of the case, the Commission has taken the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned into account when determining the quantum of the proposed fine, as set out below.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.117        Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions, expressed[[231]](#_ftn231) its disagreement with the Commission’s proposal to have regard to the turnover of the undertaking concerned in calculating the amount of the fine.  As already noted above, this requirement was previously determined by the EDPB in its Binding Decision 1/2021 and reiterated in the Article 65 Decision.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to disregard this requirement.  Neither is it open to the Commission to treat “Meta Ireland alone” as being the relevant “undertaking” for these purposes[[232]](#_ftn232).\n\n## WHETHER TO IMPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE FINE\n\nThe Transparency Infringements\n\n9.118 I proposed to impose an administrative fine in relation to **the Transparency Infringements** in circumstances where:\n\n•       The infringements are serious in nature. The lack of transparency goes to the heart of data subject rights and risks undermining their effectiveness by not providing transparent information in that regard. While the infringements considered here relate to one lawful basis, it nonetheless concerns vast swathes of personal data impacting millions of data subjects. When such factors are considered, it is clear that the infringements are serious in their gravity.  I have taken this into account when determining, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, that the infringements are at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness.\n\n•       Over  of the population of the EEA seems to be impacted by the infringements. This is a very large figure.  I consider this to be an aggravating factor of significant weight.\n\n•       I note in particular the impact a lack of transparency has on a data subject’s ability to be fully informed about their data protection rights, or indeed about whether in their view they should exercise those rights.  I have taken this into account when determining, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, that the infringements are at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness.\n\n•       I have already found that the infringement was negligent. While I am not calling into question Facebook’s right to come to a genuine view on this matter, I am taking into account the failure of an organisation of this size to provide sufficiently transparent materials in relation to the core of its business model.  For the avoidance of doubt, and noting the views expressed by the EDPB in its Fining Guidelines 04/2022, that “(a)t best, negligence could be regarded as neutral”, I have taken this into account as a neutral factor.\n\n•       I note that Facebook’s Data Policy and Terms of Service have been amended, and because this is an Inquiry into a particular complaint the documents being considered are no longer contemporary. Therefore, I am not attaching significant weight to the question of the duration of the infringement, in circumstances where more recent versions of the relevant documents are outside the scope of the Inquiry.  In the circumstances, and for the avoidance of doubt, I have taken this into account as a neutral factor.\n\n9.119        Facebook argues that the infringements set out above are “_co-extensive_” and amount to the same infringement.[[233]](#_ftn233) It is incorrect to state that these amount to different labels for the same infringement. One amounts to a failure to provide information that is required by the law. The other amounts to a failure to provide the information required by the law (only some of which has been provided) in the manner the law requires. The information that is and is not provided both relate to data processing on foot of one provision of the GDPR. That does not in and of itself render them the same infringement. A failure to provide certain information and a failure to set out other information in a particular manner are self-evidently different infringements in their character. \n\n9.120        Based on the analysis set out above, the nature, gravity and duration of the infringements and the potential number of data subjects affected, I proposed, by way of the Draft Decision, to impose the following administrative fines in respect of the Transparency Infringements:\n\n•       In respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €18 million and €22 million.\n\n•       In respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €10 million and €14 million. \n\n9.121        In determining the quantum of the fines proposed above, I took account of the requirement, set out in Article 83(1) GDPR, for fines imposed to be “_effective, proportionate and dissuasive_” in each individual case. My view was that, in order for any fine to be “effective”, it must reflect the circumstances of the individual case. As already discussed above, the Infringements are serious, both in terms of the extremely large number of data subjects potentially affected, the categories of personal data involved, and the consequences that flow from the failure to comply with the transparency requirements for users.\n\n9.122        In order for a fine to be “dissuasive”, it must dissuade both the controller/processor concerned as well as other controllers/processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the conduct concerned.  \n\n9.123        As regards the requirement for any fine to be “proportionate”, this requires the adjustment of the quantum of any proposed fine to the minimum amount necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR. My view was that the fines proposed above did not exceed what was necessary to enforce compliance with the GDPR, taking into account the size of Facebook’s user base, the impact of the infringements on the effectiveness of the data subject rights enshrined in\n\nChapter III of the GDPR and the importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR as a whole.  \n\n9.124        Accordingly, my view was that the fines proposed above would, if imposed on Facebook, be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, taking into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry.\n\n9.125        Further to the circulation of the Draft Decision to the concerned supervisory authorities for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections were raised in relation to this aspect of matters by the supervisory authorities of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland.  Having considered the merits of those objections, the EDPB determined as follows:\n\n391.       The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect. The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model, the risk of this occurring is all the greater. By bearing the cost the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment.\n\n392.       Though the IE SA touches upon the notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in relation to the proposed fine, there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to explain the modest fine range chosen. Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine\n\n  \n\nit proposed does not exceed the maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR, the Draft Decision does not articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness. In this regard the EDPB recalls that the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned is considered for the calculation of the fine.\n\n393.       While a single mitigating factor identified by the IE SA is mentioned, there is no indication the weight that has been attributed to this factor in the context of the Article 83(2) assessment. As indicated above (see paragraph 366), the EDPB finds the Draft Decision does not sufficiently justify this mitigating factor, hence it should not be considered an aggravating or mitigating factor.\n\n394.       In light of the above, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.\n\n9.126 I note that, with the exception of the proposed treatment, in the Draft Decision, of the matters originally assessed pursuant to Article 83(2)(c) (which has now been amended in line with the instruction set out in the Article 65 Decision), the EDPB agreed with the manner in which the Commission assessed the circumstances of the Transparency Infringements for the purposes of the Article 83(2) criteria.  That being the case, it seems clear that the EDPB’s instruction, above, concerns my view that the originally proposed fines were effective, proportionate and dissuasive for the purpose of Article 83(1) GDPR.  In other words, the focus of the EDPB’s instruction is the _quantum_ of the fines that were originally proposed by the Article 60 Draft Decision.  I note, in this regard, the EDPB’s instruction that I set out a “significantly” higher fine, in comparison with the upper limit for the originally proposed administrative fines.  By way of guidance, the Article 65 Decision records as follows:\n\n389. The FR SA compares the proposed fine with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited for transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR). The FR SA also compares with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR). While the EDPB agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR, the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the FR SA do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regard to the infringements involved. Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter.\n\n9.127 On the basis of the instruction and guidance set out above, I propose to impose administrative fines as follows:\n\n•       In respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €75 million and €85 million.\n\n•       In respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €65 million and €75 million.\n\n9.128 I expressed the (provisional) view that administrative fines within these ranges would satisfy the requirement, in Article 83(1) GDPR for any administrative fine imposed to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.  In this regard, I have taken account of:\n\na.       The purpose of the fine, which is to sanction the infringements of Articles 12(1), 13(1)(c), 5(1)(a) (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) that was found to have occurred (by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision);\n\nb.       The requirement for any fine to be effective.  In this regard, I note that the fines proposed above reflect the circumstances of the case, including both the specific elements of the infringement as well as those elements that relate to the controller which committed the infringement, namely its financial position (as required by paragraph 414 of the EDPB’s Binding Decision 1/2021);\n\nc.       The requirement for a genuinely deterrent effect, in terms of discouraging both Facebook and others from committing the same infringement in the future; \n\nd.       The requirement for any fine to be proportionate and to not exceed what is necessary to achieve the stated objective (as recorded at a., above).  The Commission considers that the fines proposed are proportionate to the circumstances of the case, taking into account the gravity of the infringements and all of the elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease (mitigating factors) of the initial assessment as well as the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned.  It also takes account of the views, assessments and instructions of the EDPB, as set out in the Article 65 Decision (and incorporated into this Decision, above).  It also takes account of the fact that the fine will be imposed in addition to an order requiring Facebook to take action to bring its processing into compliance.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the re-assessment of the administrative fines originally proposed by the Draft Decision, in relation to the Transparency Infringements \n\n9.129        Facebook, by way of the Final Submissions[[234]](#_ftn234), has challenged the proposed reassessment of the fines corresponding to the Transparency Infringements.\n\n9.130        Insofar as the relevant submissions express disagreement with matters that have been determined by the EDPB or, otherwise, upon which the EDPB has expressed a view, in the Article 65 Decision, that decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, it is not open to the Commission to disregard or otherwise look behind any views expressed or instructions given by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision.\n\n9.131        Furthermore, insofar as the relevant submissions restate matters that have already been considered by the Commission (such as Facebook’s view that the Transparency Infringements are “technical in nature”), I do not propose to engage further with such matters.\n\n9.132        As regards Facebook’s submission[[235]](#_ftn235) that its willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the conclusion of this Inquiry on the basis that it has “now clearly “gone beyond willingness” to give effect to such substantial changes”, I am unable to take account of any such action given that it occurred after the circulation of the Draft Decision to the CSAs for their views, pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR and, otherwise, in the absence of an assessment of the adequacy of the steps taken.\n\n9.133        Facebook has further submitted that the proposed increase is incompatible with Article 83(1) GDPR.  It also notes the inconsistency between the increased fining ranges being proposed and the Commission’s previously expressed view that the lower fining ranges proposed by the Draft Decision were effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  It is important to bear in mind, in this regard, that the Commission’s view, that the previously proposed fining ranges were effective, proportionate and dissuasive, has been overtaken by the Article 65 Decision.  The EDPB, in that decision, expressed a range of views and it is not open to the Commission to look behind those views, as appears to be suggested by Facebook.\n\n9.134        As regards Facebook’s submissions[[236]](#_ftn236) directed to challenging how the increased fining ranges might be said to be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, I note that these submissions share a range of common arguments, including:\n\n•       Submissions that it is not appropriate for the Commission to take account of Facebook’s “financial position” and questioning the difference between “financial position” and “turnover” in circumstances where the Commission previously indicated that it had taken Facebook’s turnover into account when assessing the quantum of the originally proposed fining ranges;\n\n•       Submissions concerning the level of the increase proposed by the Commission.  Facebook has submitted, in this regard, that the Commission “has proposed an increase well in excess of the purported instruction of the EDPB “to set out a significantly higher fine amount” in respect of these alleged infringements”.  Facebook has further suggested that: “(i)t appears (although this is not clear) that the [Commission] was influenced in this regard by the EDPB’s comments regarding fines imposed by other supervisory authorities in respect of transparency infringements, namely the WhatsApp and Amazon Decisions.  Without engaging in any factual assessment of these decisions, the EDPB asserts that these cases “show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams.  Moreover, there are similarities with regard to the infringements involved”.\n\n9.135        As already noted above, the Commission is required, by the Article 65 Decision and Binding Decision 1/2021, to take account of the turnover of the undertaking concerned when quantifying the amount of the proposed administrative fine.  The Commission did so as part of its original assessment, however the EDPB, by way of the Article 65 Decision, instructed the Commission to re-assess quantum on the basis that the proposed amounts were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR.  The Article 65 Decision provides at paragraph 391, for example, that:\n\n“The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect. The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, **in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business**. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model, the risk of this occurring is all the greater. By bearing the cost the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment.” [emphasis added]\n\n9.136        In the circumstances, it was incumbent on the Commission to re-assess the manner in which account was previously taken of the turnover of the undertaking concerned.  The Commission notes, in this regard, the very significant turnover of the Meta Platforms, Inc. group of companies and considers that the increased fining ranges take appropriate account of that significant level of turnover, as required by the Article 65 Decision.  For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Commission has, first and foremost, addressed its mind to the Article 83 framework when assessing the questions of whether an administrative fine ought to be imposed and, if so, the amount of any such fine.  That ought to be clear from the detailed analysis of the individual circumstances of this Inquiry set out in this Section 9.  Otherwise, the Commission has re-assessed the quantum of its originally proposed fines by reference to the instructions and directions provided by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision.  Any suggestions of comparison with the Amazon or WhatsApp decisions are without foundation.\n\n9.137        Having taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the views set out in paragraphs 9.127 and 9.128, above.\n\nProposed quantum of fining range - the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement\n\n9.138        In relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, my conclusions, further to the Article 83(2) assessment recorded above, are that:\n\n•                The infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) has been assessed as falling at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a).\n\n•                The seriously negligent character of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement ought, in the particular circumstances of this inquiry, to be taken into account as an aggravating factor of significant weight.\n\n•                The degree of responsibility of the controller is to be treated as an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight.\n\n•                The broad range of categories of personal data affected by the infringement ought to be taken into account as an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight.\n\n•                Otherwise, the assessments of the Article 83(2)(c), 83(2)(e), 83(2)(f), 83(2)(h), 83(2)(i), 83(2)(j) and 83(2)(k) criteria are to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating for the purpose of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement.\n\n9.139        On the basis of the above, I proposed to impose an (additional) administrative fine of an amount falling within the range of €55 million and €65 million, in respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle).\n\n9.140        I expressed the (provisional) view that an administrative fine within this range would satisfy the requirement in Article 83(1) GDPR for any administrative fine imposed to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.  In this regard, I have taken account of:\n\na.       The purpose of the fine, which is to sanction the infringement of Article 6(1) (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) that was found to have occurred (by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision);\n\nb.       The requirement for any fine to be effective.  In this regard, the Commission notes that the fine proposed above reflects the circumstances of the case, including both the specific elements of the infringement as well as those elements that relate to the controller which committed the infringement, namely its financial position (as required by paragraph 414 of the EDPB’s Binding Decision 1/2021);\n\nc.       The requirement for a genuinely deterrent effect, in terms of discouraging both Facebook and others from committing the same infringement in the future; \n\nd.       The requirement for any fine to be proportionate and to not exceed what is necessary to achieve the stated objective (as recorded at a., above).  The Commission considers that the fine proposed is proportionate to the circumstances of the case, taking into account the gravity of the infringements and all of the elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease (mitigating factors) of the initial assessment as well as the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned.  It also takes account of the fact that the fine will be imposed in addition to an order requiring Facebook to take action to bring its processing into compliance;\n\ne.       I have also taken particular account, in this regard, of the facts that:\n\ni.               The EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR was partially based on the lack of transparency (see, for example, paragraphs 123, 125 and 126 of the Article 65 Decision) as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Facebook Terms of Service.\n\nii.              The EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle was similarly largely based on the lack of transparency (see, for example, paragraphs 226, 229 and 230 of the Article 65 Decision), as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Terms of Service.  \n\niii.            As already noted, this Decision contains separate findings of infringement of the transparency obligations set out in Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) and proposes to exercise corresponding corrective powers in the form of administrative fines and an order to bring processing into compliance.  I have taken these separate punitive and remedial, respectively, measures into account when proposing the fining range set out above so as to avoid the risk of punishing Facebook twice in respect of the same conduct.  This factor necessitated a moderately significant reduction in the fine that might otherwise have been imposed, notwithstanding the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned and the outcome of the Article 83(2)(a) assessment, as recorded above.\n\nFacebook’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n\n9.141        Facebook, by way of its Final Submissions, disagreed with the above assessments of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement.  For ease of response, I have summarised the relevant submissions thematically, as follows:\n\n_Discretion of the Commission_\n\n9.142        Under this heading, Facebook submitted, firstly[[237]](#_ftn237), that by proposing “_exponential increases to the administrative fines in respect of [the Transparency Infringements] … the [Commission] has taken account of the Article 65 Decision and no additional administrative fine is required or warranted in respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR_”.  Facebook notes, in this regard, that the Article 65 Decision requires the Commission to impose an administrative fine to “cover” the EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\n9.143        It submitted, secondly[[238]](#_ftn238), that the imposition of a fine for the Article 6(1) infringement while also substantially increasing the fines for the Transparency Infringements is disproportionate and unnecessary in circumstances where the infringements are based on the same underlying processing and alleged harm to data subjects.\n\n9.144        Thirdly, it submitted[[239]](#_ftn239) that, just as the Commission has decided not to impose an additional fine in respect of Article 5(1)(a) (fairness principle) GDPR due to the overlapping nature of the infringements, it should similarly decide not to impose an additional fine in relation to the Article 6(1) infringement because this would risk punishing Facebook twice for the same wrongdoing.  Furthermore, it submitted[[240]](#_ftn240) that it was “_particularly inappropriate for the [Commission] to impose three separate and substantial fines in respect of these infringements, having regard to the principle of concurrence of laws.  It cannot plausibly be maintained that these infringements are sufficiently distinct to warrant three separate fines in circumstances where the [Commission] itself considers the conduct constituting the alleged Article 6(1) infringement to be so similar to the other infringements that it can incorporate significant elements of the fines assessment by reference._”\n\n9.145        The above submissions are premised upon the misunderstanding that the Commission has discretion, as regards, the imposition of a fine for the Article 6(1) infringement.  The Commission, being subject to a binding decision of the EDPB, has no such discretion.  This is clear from the Article 65 Decision itself, in particular paragraphs 441 and 442 thereof, which state that:\n\n“_the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the [supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, France, Norway and Sweden] in their objections.  The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection._\n\n_Several of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.”_\n\n9.146        In the circumstances, it is clear that the Commission is required to impose an administrative fine in respect of the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB and, when doing so, to take account of the instructions, deliberations and determinations of the EDPB, as recorded in Section 9.2.4.2.1 of the Article 65 Decision.\n\n9.147        It is important to note that this instruction (to impose an administrative fine for the Article 6(1) infringement) sits separately to, and alongside, the EDPB’s further instruction that the Commission “set out a significantly higher fine amount” in respect of the Transparency Infringements that were already proposed by way of the Draft Decision. \n\n9.148        Finally, as regards the Commission’s decision not to impose a separate administrative fine in respect of the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision specifically afforded the Commission discretion in relation to the manner in which this particular infringement might be addressed by way of a corrective power. \n\nThis is clear from paragraph 479 of the Article 65 Decision.  The inclusion of this express discretion\n\nis in marked contrast with the absence of any similar discretion in relation to the imposition/increase of administrative fines for the Article 6(1) and Transparency Infringements.\n\n_Inadequate Rationalisation_\n\n9.149        Under this heading, Facebook submitted[[241]](#_ftn241) that “_the reasoning in the Draft Decision in respect of the calculation of the fines is inadequate, such that it is impossible to understand how the proposed fining ranges have been calculated or how the different factors discussed by the [Commission] have had an impact on the proposed fine and, as a result, to make meaningful submissions in respect of same_.”\n\n9.150        I do not agree that this is the case.  As is evident from the extensive analysis set out above, the Commission has clearly identified the factors that were considered relevant for the purpose of each of the individual Article 83(2) assessments.  Furthermore, the manner in which the relevant factors have been taken into account, as a mitigating or aggravating factor, as well as the weight that has been attributed to each one has been clearly addressed.  \n\n9.151        This approach is in line with the Commission’s obligation to provide reasons for its decisions.  While the Commission is required to explain how it arrived at the level of a proposed fine, it is not required to apply such specificity so as to allow a controller or processor to make a precise mathematical calculation of the expected fine[[242]](#_ftn242).\n\n_Incompatibility with Article 83(1) GDPR_\n\n9.152        Facebook, by way of its Final Submissions, has submitted[[243]](#_ftn243) that the proposed fine for the Article 6(1) infringement _“– both individually and taken cumulatively with the other significant administrative fines being proposed in respect of the Transparency Infringements – is inconsistent with the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR_”. \n\n9.153        Facebook further submits that the proposed fine is “_manifestly excessive and far higher than the minimum amount necessary to be “effective” and “dissuasive”, and is therefore not “proportionate_”.”\n\n9.154        Facebook, thirdly, submits that the reasoning in the Draft Decision as to why the administrative fines comply with the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR is “wholly inadequate”.  Facebook has added, in this regard, that this has undermined its ability to make meaningful submissions in response to same.\n\n9.155        I note that, in having detailed my views as to the reasons why I consider the proposed fines to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, I have followed the directions of the EDPB that were set out on this particular matter in its Binding Decision 1/2021[[244]](#_ftn244).  Accordingly, I consider that the Commission has adequately addressed this aspect of matters.\n\n9.156        Otherwise, I note that I have already addressed many of the matters raised by Facebook as part of this aspect of its Final Submissions elsewhere in this Decision.  In relation to Facebook’s submissions concerning the “_very onerous compliance order requiring significant expenditure of resources_”, it is important to recall that the objective sought to be achieved by the Order (the remediation of any identified infringements) differs from the objective sought to be achieved by the imposition of an administrative fine (the sanctioning of any identified infringements).  Furthermore, the “significant expenditure of resources” are the resources of Facebook itself, which is, as already noted, an entity with significant resources available to it.  In the circumstances, I do not agree that, in the circumstances of this particular inquiry, such matters should operate to offset the quantum of any proposed fine.\n\n9.157        Having completed my assessment of whether or not to impose a fine (and of the amount of any such fine), I must now consider the remaining provisions of Article 83 GDPR, with a view to ascertaining if there are any factors that might require the adjustment of the proposed fines.\n\n9.158        Having taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the views set out in paragraphs 9.139 and 9.140, above.\n\n### 10 OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS\n\n**_A_****_RTICLE 83(3)_** **_GDPR_**\n\n10.1      Article 83(3) GDPR provides that:\n\n“_If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement._”\n\n10.2 As outlined previously, Facebook’s infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 13(1)(c), and 12(1) GDPR all relate to the same processing operations concerning its processing carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Therefore, the total amount of the administrative fine must not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement. The gravest infringement identified is the failure to provide the information mandated by Articles 13(1)(c) and 5(1)(a) GDPR. \n\n10.3 Subsequent to the finalisation of the Preliminary Draft Decision, the EDPB adopted a binding decision (“**the EDPB Decision**”)272 relating to IN 18-12-2, an inquiry conducted by the Commission into WhatsApp Ireland Limited’s compliance with Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR. The EDPB Decision arose out of a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Article 65 GDPR, and was adopted by the Commission in conjunction with the Commission’s final decision on 2 September 2021.\n\n10.4 The EDPB Decision applies an interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR that differs from the interpretation I set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision. In light of the Commission’s obligations of cooperation and consistency in, _inter alia_, Articles 60(1) and 63 GDPR, it is necessary for me to follow the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in future inquiries given that it is a matter of general interpretation that is not specific to the facts of the case in which it arose. \n\n10.5      The relevant passage of the EDPB decision is as follows:\n\n“_315. All CSAs argued in their respective objections that not taking into account infringements other than the “gravest infringement” is not in line with their interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, as this would result in a situation where WhatsApp IE is fined in the same way for one infringement as it would be for several infringements. On the other hand, as explained above, the IE SA argued that the assessment of whether to impose a fine, and of the amount thereof, must be carried out in respect of each individual infringement found  and the assessment of the gravity of the infringement should be done by taking into account the individual circumstances of the case. The IE SA decided to impose only a fine for the infringement of Article 14 GDPR, considering it to be the gravest of the three infringements._\n\n_316._            _The EDPB notes that the IE SA identified several infringements in the Draft Decision for which it specified fines, namely infringements of Article 12, 13 and 14 GDPR, and then applied Article 83(3) GDPR._ \n\n_317._            _Furthermore, the EDPB notes that WhatsApp IE agreed with the approach of the IE SA concerning the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR. In its submissions on the objections, WhatsApp IE also raised that the approach of the IE SA did not lead to a restriction of the IE SA’s ability to find other infringements of other provisions of the GDPR or of its ability to impose a very significant fine. WhatsApp IE argued that the alternative interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR suggested by the CSAs is not consistent with the text and structure of Article 83 GDPR and expressed support for the IE SA’s literal and purposive interpretation of the provision._\n\n272[https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf)\n\n[09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf)[.](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf) \n\n_318._            _In this case, the issue that the EDPB is called upon to decide is how the calculation of the fine is influenced by the finding of several infringements under Article 83(3) GDPR._ \n\n_319._            _Article 83(3) GDPR reads that if “a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.”_ \n\n_320._            _First of all, it has to be noted that Article 83(3) GDPR is limited in its application and will not apply to every single case in which multiple infringements are found to have occurred, but only to those cases where multiple infringements have arisen from “the same or linked processing operations”._\n\n_321._            _The EDPB highlights that the overarching purpose of Article 83 GDPR is to ensure that for each individual case, the imposition of an administrative fine in respect of an infringement of the GDPR is to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In the view of the EDPB, the ability of SAs to impose such deterrent fines highly contributes to enforcement and therefore to compliance with the GDPR._\n\n_322._            _As regards the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, the EDPB points out that the effet utile principle requires all institutions to give full force and effect to EU law.  The EDPB considers that the approach pursued by the IE SA would not give full force and effect to the enforcement and therefore to compliance with the GDPR, and would not be in line with the aforementioned purpose of Article 83 GDPR._\n\n_323._            _Indeed, the approach pursued by the IE SA would lead to a situation where, in cases of several infringements of the GDPR concerning the same or linked processing operations, the fine would always correspond to the same amount that would be identified, had the controller or processor only committed one – the gravest – infringement. The other infringements would be discarded with regard to calculating the fine. In other words, it would not matter if a controller committed one or numerous infringements of the GDPR, as only one single infringement, the gravest infringement, would be taken into account when assessing the fine._\n\n_324._            _With regard to the meaning of Article 83(3) GDPR the EDPB, bearing in mind the views expressed by the CSAs, notes that in the event of several infringements, several amounts can be determined.  However, the total amount cannot exceed a maximum limit prescribed, in the abstract, by the GDPR. More specifically, the wording “amount specified for the gravest infringement” refers to the legal maximums of fines under Articles 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR. The EDPB notes that the Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679   state that the \"occurrence of several different infringements committed together in any particular single case means that the supervisory authority is able to apply the administrative fines at a level which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive within the limit of the gravest infringement\". The guidelines include an example of an infringement of Article 8 and Article 12 GDPR and refer to the possibility for the SA to apply the corrective measure within the limit set out for the gravest infringement, i.e. in the example the limits of Article 83(5) GDPR._\n\n_325._            _The wording “total amount” also alludes to the interpretation described above. The EDPB notes that the legislator did not include in Article 83(3) GDPR that the amount of the fine for several linked infringements should be (exactly) the fine specified for the gravest infringement. The wording “total amount” in this regard already implies that other infringements have to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the fine. This is notwithstanding the duty on the SA imposing the fine to take into account the proportionality of the fine._\n\n_326._            _Although the fine itself may not exceed the legal maximum of the highest fining tier, the offender shall still be explicitly found guilty of having infringed several provisions and these infringements have to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the final fine that is to be imposed. Therefore, while the legal maximum of the fine is set by the gravest infringement with regard to Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR, other infringements cannot be discarded but have to be taken into account when calculating the fine._\n\n_327._            _In light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the objections raised by the DE SA, FR SA and PT SA with respect to Article 83(3) GDPR and to also take into account the other infringements – in addition to the gravest infringement – when calculating the fine, subject to the criteria of Article 83(1)_\n\n_GDPR of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness.”_\n\n10.6           The impact of this interpretation would be that administrative fine(s) would be imposed cumulatively, as opposed to imposing only the proposed fine for the gravest infringement. The only applicable limit for the total fine imposed, under this interpretation, would be the overall “cap”. By way of example, in a case of multiple infringements, if the gravest infringement was one which carried a maximum administrative fine of 2% of the turnover of the undertaking, the cumulative fine imposed could also not exceed 2% of the turnover of the undertaking.\n\n10.7           In this Inquiry, all of the infringements that have been found to have occurred (either by the Commission directly or by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision) are subject to the higher fining “cap” set out in Article 83(5) GDPR.  Accordingly, the total amount of administrative fines that may be imposed must not exceed 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the undertaking concerned.\n\n10.8           As the EDPB Decision was adopted subsequent to Facebook having made submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, I afforded Facebook an opportunity to make submissions on this specific matter: that is, the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR.\n\n10.9           As a preliminary matter, Facebook has objected to the manner in which it has been asked to make submissions on this interpretation, and in particular that it was provided with an extract copy of a working draft rather than an entire copy of the working draft of the Draft Decision. This, in its view, results in a requirement to make submissions “_in the abstract_” without having sight of the reasoning for the alteration of the fining range.[[245]](#_ftn245)\n\n10.10        As is set out in this Decision, Facebook has already been afforded an opportunity to make comprehensive submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision that addressed every factor proposed by the Commission for consideration in determining, if any, the appropriate fine. It was not the intention of the Commission, in this regard, to seek additional submissions from Facebook on the reasoning for a particular fining range, those submissions having already been made in detail. The purpose of requesting new submissions, on this point, was to enable Facebook to exercise a right to be heard on the application of the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in the EDPB Decision. On this basis, I do not accept that Facebook has been deprived of the opportunity to “_meaningfully exercise right to be heard_”.[[246]](#_ftn246)\n\n10.11        On the substance, Facebook has argued that the above interpretation and application of Article 83(3) GDPR is incorrect and/or should not be applied because: the EDPB decision is incorrect as a matter of law and is, in any event, not binding on the Commission; even if the decision were binding on the Commission, it does not require that the Commission impose administrative fines in the manner proposed; the Commission has not had regard to the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in Article 83(1) GDPR when determining the total cumulative proposed fine; and no decision on the correct interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR should be made prior to the determination of a pending application by WhatsApp Ireland, pursuant to Article 263 TFEU, before the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union, to annul the EDPB Decision (“the **Annulment Proceedings**”).[[247]](#_ftn247)\n\n10.12        Facebook’s first substantive submission on this matter is that the EDPB Decision is not binding on the Commission. A number of legal arguments are made in this regard, including that binding decisions of the EDPB only apply to specific individual cases (as set out in article 65(1) GDPR)[[248]](#_ftn248) and that only the CJEU can issue binding decisions on matters of EU law.[[249]](#_ftn249) For the avoidance of\n\ndoubt, the Commission has not expressed the view, nor does it hold the view, that the EDPB Decision is legally binding on it in this Inquiry and/or generally. The Commission is nonetheless, in this regard, bound by a number of provisions of the GDPR and the real question that arises in this context is the extent to which the Commission should have regard to the EDPB’s approach.\n\n10.13        The Commission is bound by Article 60(1) GDPR, which states in the imperative that “_the lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an endeavour to reach consensus_” [emphasis added]. The Commission is similarly required to cooperate with other supervisory authorities, pursuant to Article 63 GDPR. Facebook has argued that these obligations relate only to specific cases where a dispute has arisen.[[250]](#_ftn250) Moreover, it submits that the EDPB’s function in ensuring correct application of the GDPR is provided for instead in Article 70(1) GDPR, such as through issuing opinions and guidelines.[[251]](#_ftn251)\n\n10.14        It is not the position of the Commission that the EDPB in and of itself has the power to issue decisions of general application that bind supervisory authorities. The issue is not the powers or functions of the EDPB, but rather the legal responsibility of the Commission to the concerned supervisory authorities, who in themselves happen to be constituent members of the EDPB. In this regard, assistance is provided in the interpretation of the Commission’s duties under Article 60(1) GDPR by Recital 123, which states that “…_supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the Union_…”. The Commission’s view is that the duty to cooperate and ensure consistency that is placed on it by the GDPR would be rendered ineffective were it not to ensure, to the best of its ability, such interpretations were applied consistently.\n\n10.15        The alternative scenario, as proposed by Facebook, would result in entrenched interpretations being consistently advanced by individual supervisory authorities. The consequence would be inevitable dispute resolution procedures under Article 65 GDPR, and the issuing of a binding decision once again applying an alternative interpretation to the specific facts at hand that had already been comprehensively addressed in a previous dispute resolution procedure. Such a scenario would deprive the duties to cooperate and act consistently of almost any meaning. In the Commission’s view, such an interpretation would therefore be contrary to the principle of _effet utile_. This is, as has been set out, a distinct issue from the legal powers or functions of the EDPB itself.\n\n10.16        Facebook has argued that the EDPB Decision “_did not direct the_ [Commission] _to impose separate fines in respect of each infringement and to then add those fines together_”, but rather that the final amount should be considered in accordance with the requirements that the fine be effective, proportionate and dissuasive pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR. It submits that overlap between the infringements should be taken into account, in this regard.[[252]](#_ftn252) It goes on to argue that as there is _“…significant – if not complete – overlap between the infringements_”[[253]](#_ftn253) and that the fines relate to _“…what is essentially the same set of facts and alleged infringement…_”, the fine is contrary to the EU law principles of proportionality, _ne bis in idem_ and concurrence of laws.[[254]](#_ftn254)\n\n10.17        Facebook develops this aspect of its argument in a later section of its submission, by suggesting that “_it appears…that the_ [Commission] _does not propose to engage in any meaningful assessment of whether the total fine_ [meets the Article 83(1) GDPR criteria]”.[[255]](#_ftn255) Facebook argues that because the Commission viewed the fines proposed in the Preliminary Draft Decision as effective, proportionate and dissuasive, a fine that is between €8 million and €12 million higher must go beyond that standard.[[256]](#_ftn256) Facebook also argues that its ability to make submissions in relation to this new proposed fine is “_restricted_” due to it not being given sight of the entire working draft but simply of the working draft relevant to the application of the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR.285\n\n10.18        In relation to the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR, which includes the EU law principle of proportionality relied on by Facebook, the Commission refutes any suggestion that it has not had regard to this provision in proposing a final fine. The latter part of Section 9 of this Decision set out, in detail, the Commission’s reasoning as to why the proposed fine is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. Moreover, as has been set out, Facebook has provided extensive submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision as to its views on what an effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanction would be. I therefore reject any suggestion that there was “_a failure to adequately consider whether, taken as a whole, the proposed fines in respect of all the infringements are effective, proportionate and dissuasive_”. [[257]](#_ftn257)\n\n10.19        Facebook has already provided submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, which clearly set out its view on the approach to fines in this matter, without prejudice to its view that no infringement of the GDPR has taken place. The purpose of the additional opportunity for submissions referred to here was to address the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in the EDPB Decision and its application to this Inquiry, not to reopen the question of the appropriate quantum for any administrative fine and/or to provide for an additional round of submissions on that issue. The Commission in any event rejects any suggestion that the Article 83(1) GDPR criteria are not met by the new fine on the application of the new interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, and as is seen in Section 9 above, I have given due consideration to this and to Facebook’s submissions in\n\nthis regard.  I therefore remain satisfied that the proposed application of Article 83(3) GDPR is consistent with Article 83(1) GDPR, for the reasons set out here and in Section 9.\n\n10.20        In relation to the alleged contravention of the _ne bis in idem_ principle, I also reiterate the views expressed at the end of Section 9 herein, in relation to the Transparency Infringements. It sets out that the failure to provide required information, and the failure to set out required information in a transparent manner, are entirely different wrongs. The legislator has provided for two distinct requirements, and each individual requirement has been infringed by Facebook. For these reasons and the reasons set out above, I do not accept this submission. Similarly, the Commission is not applying a new and retroactive view of wrongdoing to the conduct in a manner envisaged by principle of concurrence of laws. It is simply determining the proper interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR. This has no impact on the Commission’s detailed consideration of Facebook’s submissions on the separate and more general question of the appropriate penalty.\n\n10.21        It also argues that the taking into account of the undertaking’s turnover is incorrect as a matter of law, as it is not set out as a factor in Article 83(2) GDPR. In this regard, the Commission relies on its existing analysis of its obligations to cooperate with the concerned supervisory authorities and apply the GDPR consistently. For the same reasons provided to support the Commission’s decision to apply the EDPB Decision’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in general, the Commission intends to maintain this consideration of the undertaking’s turnover.\n\n10.22        Finally, Facebook has argued that, in light of the intended Annulment Proceedings in respect of the WhatsApp Decision, the Commission should not finalise the Draft Decision until a final decision as to the correct interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR has been made by the CJEU. Facebook’s submission is simply that “_there is, at a minimum, very considerable doubt as to the correct interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR_” and that on this basis the Commission should not proceed with this Decision until the matter is finalised.[[258]](#_ftn258) Facebook has provided no legal authority in support of this proposition. Notwithstanding the possible overlap between some of the questions referred and the issues arising for decision in this inquiry, given the advanced stage of this Inquiry I am satisfied that there is no reason to delay this matter. The prospect of intended legal proceedings in respect of a separate decision does not provide any basis in law for suspending a separate Inquiry. \n\n10.23        For the sake of completeness, I note that Facebook reiterated its concerns as part of its Final Submissions[[259]](#_ftn259).  I have already addressed the subject-matter of those concerns above.\n\n**_A_****_RTICLE 83(5)_** **_GDPR_**\n\n10.24        Turning, finally, to Article 83(5) GDPR, I note that this provision operates to limit the maximum amount of any fine that may be imposed in respect of certain types of infringement, as follows:\n\n_“Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:_\n\n_(a)_  _the basic principles for processing … pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;_\n\n_(b)_  _the data subjects’ rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22; …”_\n\n10.25        In order to determine the applicable fining “cap”, it is firstly necessary to consider whether or not the fine is to be imposed on “an undertaking”. Recital 150 clarifies, in this regard, that:\n\n_“Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes.”_\n\n10.26        Accordingly, when considering a respondent’s status as an undertaking, the GDPR requires me to do so by reference to the concept of ‘undertaking’, as that term is understood in a competition law context. In this regard, the CJEU has established that:\n\n“_an undertaking_ _encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed”[**[260]**](#_ftn260)_.\n\n10.27        The CJEU has held that a number of different enterprises could together comprise a single economic unit where one of those enterprises is able to exercise decisive influence over the behaviour of the others on the market. Such decisive influence may arise, for example, in the context of a parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary. Where an entity (such as a subsidiary) does not independently decide upon its own conduct on the market, but carries out, in all material respects, the instructions given to it by another entity (such as a parent), this means that both entities constitute a single economic unit and a single undertaking for the purpose of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. The ability, on the part of the parent company, to exercise decisive influence over the subsidiary’s behaviour on the market, means that the conduct of the subsidiary may be imputed to the parent company, without having to establish the personal involvement of the parent company in the infringement290.\n\n10.28        In the context of Article 83 GDPR, the concept of ‘undertaking’ means that, where there is another entity that is in a position to exercise decisive influence over the controller/processor’s behaviour on the market, then they will together constitute a single economic entity and a single undertaking. Accordingly, the relevant fining “cap” will be calculated by reference to the turnover of the undertaking as a whole, rather than the turnover of the controller or processor concerned.\n\n10.29        In order to ascertain whether a subsidiary determines its conduct on the market independently, account must be taken of all the relevant factors relating to the economic, organisational and legal links which tie the subsidiary to the parent company, which may vary from case to case[[261]](#_ftn261).\n\n10.30        The CJEU has, however, established[[262]](#_ftn262) that, where a parent company has a 100% shareholding in a subsidiary, it follows that: the parent company is able to exercise decisive influence over the conduct of the subsidiary; and a rebuttable presumption arises that the parent company does in fact exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary.  \n\n10.31        The CJEU has also established that, in a case where a company holds all or almost all of the capital of an intermediate company which, in turn, holds all or almost all of the capital of a subsidiary of its group, there is also a rebuttable presumption that that company exercises a decisive influence over the conduct of the intermediate company and indirectly, via that company, also over the conduct of that subsidiary[[263]](#_ftn263).\n\n10.32        The General Court has further held that, in effect, the presumption may be applied in any case where the parent company is in a similar situation to that of a sole owner as regards its power to exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary[[264]](#_ftn264).  This reflects the position that:\n\n“_… the presumption of actual exercise of decisive influence is based, in essence, on the premise that the fact that a parent company holds all or virtually all the share capital of its subsidiary enables the Commission to conclude, without supporting evidence, that that parent company has the power to exercise a decisive influence over the subsidiary without there being any need to take into account the interests of other shareholders when adopting strategic decisions or in the day-to-day business of that subsidiary, which does not determine its own market conduct independently, but in accordance with the wishes of that parent company_ …[[265]](#_ftn265)”\n\n10.33        Where the presumption of decisive influence has been raised, it may be rebutted by the production of sufficient evidence that shows, by reference to the economic, organisational and legal links between the two entities, that the subsidiary acts independently on the market.  \n\n10.34        It is important to note that “decisive influence”, in this context, refers to the ability of a parent company to influence, directly or indirectly, the way in which its subsidiary organises its affairs, in a corporate sense, for example, in relation to its day-to-day business or the adoption of strategic decisions.  While this could include, for example, the ability to direct a subsidiary to comply with all applicable laws, including the GDPR, in a general sense, it does not require the parent to have the ability to determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data by its subsidiary.\n\n10.35        I have noted already that Facebook’s ultimate parent is Facebook Inc. I also note that Note 22 of the Financial Statements most recently filed, as at the date of preparation of the Preliminary Draft Decision[[266]](#_ftn266), further confirms, on page 34, that:\n\n“_Controlling parties:_\n\n_At 31 December 2018, the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook International Operations Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland, its registered office being 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2._\n\n_The ultimate holding company and ultimate controlling party is Facebook Inc., a company incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America.  The ultimate holding company and controlling party of the smallest and largest group of which the company is a member, and for which consolidated financial statements are drawn up, is Facebook, Inc._”\n\n10.36        On this basis, it is my understanding that Facebook is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook International Operations Limited; Facebook International Operations Limited is wholly owned and controlled by Facebook Inc.; and, as regards any intermediary companies in the corporate chain, between Facebook and Facebook, Inc., it is assumed, by reference to the statement at Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements (quoted above) that the “_ultimate holding company and controlling party of the smallest and largest group of which_ [Facebook] _is a member … is Facebook, Inc._”. It is therefore assumed that Facebook, Inc. is in a similar situation to that of a sole owner as regards its power to (directly or indirectly) exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of Facebook.\n\n10.37        It seemed therefore at the time of preparing the Preliminary Draft Decision, that the corporate structure of the entities concerned is such that Facebook Inc. is in a position to exercise decisive influence over Facebook’s behaviour on the market. Accordingly, a rebuttable presumption will arise to the effect that Facebook Inc. does in fact exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of Facebook on the market.\n\n10.38        If this presumption is not rebutted, it would mean that Facebook, Inc. and Facebook constitute a single economic unit and therefore form a single undertaking within the meaning of Article 101 TFEU.  Consequently, the relevant fining “cap” for the purpose of Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR, would fall to be determined by reference to the consolidated turnover of the group of companies headed by Meta Platforms, Inc.. Facebook has made submissions in this regard in an attempt to rebut the presumption of decisive influence. \n\n10.39        In particular, Facebook submitted that the presumption of decisive influence on the market does not translate into a data protection context without considering what “behaviour on the market” means in a data protection context.[[267]](#_ftn267) It argues that this analysis should focus instead on the entity that has the decision-making capacity in the context of data protection matters, rather than matters relating to the market in general as is the case in competition law. I do not agree with this assessment. Firstly, the suggested approach (involving an assessment of where the decisionmaking power lies, in relation to the processing of personal data) is effectively a replication of the assessment that must be undertaken at the outset of the inquiry process, the outcome of which determines (i) the party/parties to which the inquiry should be addressed; and (ii) (in cross border processing cases) the supervisory authority with jurisdiction to conduct the inquiry. Given the consequences that flow from this type of assessment, it would not be appropriate for this assessment to be conducted at the decision-making stage of an inquiry.\n\n10.40        Secondly, the suggested approach could not be applied equally in each and every case. Where, for example, the presumption of decisive influence has been raised in the context of a crossborder processing case where one of the entities under assessment is outside of the EU, an assessment of that entity’s ability to exercise decisive influence over the respondent’s data processing activities would likely exceed scope of Article 3 GDPR. Such a scenario risks undermining the Commission’s ability to comply with its obligation, pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR, to ensure that the imposition of fines, in each individual case, is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”.\n\n10.41        Finally “behaviour on the market” has a meaning normally ascribed to it in EU competition law. In summary, “behaviour on the market” describes how an entity behaves and conducts its affairs in the context of the economic activity in which it engages. Such behaviour will include matters such as the policies and procedures it implements, the marketing strategy it pursues, the terms and conditions attaching to any products or services it delivers, its pricing structures, etc. I therefore can see no basis in law, in Facebook’s submissions or otherwise, to deviate from this well-established principle as set out both in the GDPR, other provisions of EU law and the jurisprudence of the CJEU.\n\n10.42        Applying the above to Article 83(5) GDPR, I first note that, in circumstances where the fine is being imposed on an ‘undertaking’, a fine of up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year may be imposed. I note, in this regard, that Meta Platforms, Inc. reported the generation of revenue in the amount of $117,929 billion in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. That being the case, the fine proposed above does not exceed the applicable fining “cap” prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR[[268]](#_ftn268).\n\n## SUMMARY OF ENVISAGED ACTION\n\n10.43 I therefore decide to exercise the following corrective powers:\n\n10.44 An order is hereby made, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, requiring Facebook to bring processing into compliance (“the **Order**”) within a period of three months commencing on the day following the date of service, on Facebook, of this Decision.  More specifically, the Order**:**\n\na.       firstly, requires Facebook to bring the Data Policy and Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards information provided on: (i) data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as well as (ii) data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook service, in accordance with the principles set out in this Decision; and\n\nb.       secondly, requires Facebook to take the necessary action to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising (“the **Processing**”), in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service, into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR in accordance with the conclusion reached by the EDPB, as recorded at paragraphs 132 and 133 of the Article 65 Decision.  More specifically, in this regard, Facebook is required to take the necessary action to address the EDPB’s finding that Facebook is not entitled to carry out the Processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, taking into account the analysis and views expressed by the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 of the Article 65 Decision.  Such action may include, but is not limited to, the identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis, in Article 6(1) GDPR, for the Processing together with the implementation of any necessary measures, as might be required to satisfy the conditionality associated with that/those alternative legal basis/bases.\n\n10.45 An administrative fine is hereby imposed, pursuant to Articles 58(2)(i) and 83, addressed to Facebook, in the amount of €210 million.  For the avoidance of doubt, that fine reflects the infringements that were found to have occurred, as follows:\n\na.       In respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out in purported reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, a fine in the amount of €80 million is hereby imposed.\n\nb.       In respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in purported reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, a fine in the amount of €70 million is hereby imposed.\n\nc.       In respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle), a fine in the amount of €60 million is hereby imposed.\n\n**This Decision is addressed to:**\n\n**Meta Platforms Ireland Limited 4 Grand Canal Square**\n\n**Grand Canal Harbour**\n\n**Dublin 2**\n\n**Dated the 31st day of December 2022**\n\n**Decision-Maker for the Commission:**\n\n**_______________________________________ Helen Dixon**\n\n**Commissioner for Data Protection**\n\n**SCHEDULE** **1**\n\n### 3              CHRONOLOGY, PROCEDURAL AND SCOPE MATTERS PERTAINING TO INQUIRY PROVISIONALLY DECIDED\n\n1.6 The Complaint was lodged with the Austrian DPA on 25 May 2018 (the date on which the GDPR became applicable) by the Complainant’s representative: “_noyb_ – European Center for Digital Rights” (“**NOYB**”). The legal framework for the Complaint as lodged with the Commission is set out below. In brief, the Complaint concerns the lawfulness of Facebook’s processing of personal data, specifically data processing on foot of the Complainant’s acceptance of Facebook’s Terms of Service, and the transparency of information provided by Facebook to the Complainant about that processing.\n\n1.7 The Commission began the Inquiry by designating an investigator (“the **Investigato**r”), who produced a draft of an inquiry report (“the **Draft Report**”) and, following submissions from the Parties, a final inquiry report (“the **Final Report**”). In considering this Inquiry, I have relied on the facts as set out in the Final Report. I have also had regard to the views set out by the Investigator in the Final Report, as well as to the entirety of the file, in preparing this Schedule.\n\n1.8 The preliminary draft decision (“the **Preliminary Draft Decision**”) set out my provisional findings, as the decision-maker in this matter, in relation to (i) whether or not an infringement of the GDPR has occurred/is occurring; and (ii) the envisaged action to be taken by the Commission in respect of same. The Preliminary Draft Decision was circulated to Facebook and NOYB (collectively “the **Parties**”) on 14 May 2021.  I received submissions from the Parties.  \n\n1.9 The submissions were received and taken into account by the Commission. I have finalised a draft version this Schedule and a draft decision (“the **Draft Decision**”), which was submitted by the Commission to other concerned supervisory authorities (‘the **CSAs**”) (within the meaning of Article 4(22) GDPR), pursuant to Article 60 GDPR, on 6 October 2021.  The Preliminary Draft Decision and this Schedule were provided to the Parties for the purpose of allowing them to make submissions in relation to my provisional findings. I considered the submissions so made by the Parties and, where necessary, made amendments to take account of these prior to the finalisation of the Draft Decision. The Schedule and Draft Decision were circulated to the CSAs in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 60 GDPR and as explained in, _inter alia_, my letters sent to Facebook and the Complainant respectively on 17 April 2020 (“the **Article 60 Process**”).\n\n1.10 The cross-border processing under examination in this Inquiry was such that all other EU/EEA supervisory authorities (“**SAs**, each one being an “**SA**”) were engaged as supervisory authorities concerned (“**CSAs**”) for the purpose of the cooperation process outlined in Article 60 of the GDPR.  Following the circulation of the Draft Decision and Schedule to the CSAs for the purpose of enabling them to express their views, in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections were raised by the SAs of Austria, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, France, Portugal, Italy and Hamburg (representing a co-ordinated response by the German SAs).  A number of comments were also exchanged by various CSAs.\n\n1.11 Having considered the matters raised, the Commission, by way of a Composite Response Memorandum dated 25 July 2022, set out its responses to the various objections and comments.  Ultimately, it was not possible to reach consensus with the CSAs on the subject-matter of the objections and, accordingly, the Commission determined that it would not follow them.  That being the case, the Commission referred the objections to the EDPB for determination pursuant to the Article 65(1)(a) dispute resolution mechanism.  In advance of doing so, the Commission invited Facebook to exercise its right to be heard on all of the material that the Commission proposed to put before the EDPB.  Facebook exercised its right to be heard by way of its submissions dated 15 July 2022 (the “**Article 65 Submissions**”).  \n\n1.12 The EDPB adopted its Article 65 Decision on 5 December 2022 and notified it to the Commission and all other CSAs on 6 December 2022.  As per Article 65(1), the EDPB’s decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, and as required by Article 65(6) of the GDPR, the Commission has now amended its Draft Decision, by way of this Decision, in order to take account of the EDPB’s determination of the various objections from the CSAs which it deemed to be “relevant and reasoned” for the purpose of Article 4(24) of the GDPR.  As part of the amendment process, Facebook was invited to exercise its right to be heard in relation to any matters in relation to which the Commission was required to make a final determination or, otherwise, exercise its own discretion.  Facebook exercised its right to be heard by way of its submissions furnished under cover of letter dated 19 December 2022 (“the **Final Submissions**”)\n\n1.13 For the avoidance of doubt, this Schedule is an integral and operative part of my final decision (“the **Decision**) for the purposes of Article 60 and 65 GDPR. The previous division of material into two documents is entirely a structural choice, so as to enable a more exclusive focus on the substantive Complaint in the main document, while dealing with matters of a more procedural nature herein.  It has been incorporated into the Decision itself as part of the finalisation process, prior to adoption.\n\n**_L_****_EGAL_** **_B_****_ASIS FOR THE_** **_I_****_NQUIRY_**\n\n1.14 The Inquiry in this case was conducted by the Investigator under Section 110 of the 2018 Act.\n\n1.15 The decision-making process for the Inquiry which applies to this case is provided for under Section 113(2)(a) of the 2018 Act. Additionally, Section 113(3)(a) of the Act requires that the Commission must consider the information obtained during the Inquiry; decide whether an infringement is occurring or has occurred; and if so, decide on the envisaged action (if any) to be taken in relation to the data controller. This function is performed by me in my role as the decision-maker. In so doing, I have carried out an independent assessment of all of the materials provided to me by the Investigator. \n\n1.16 As stated above, the Inquiry was commenced pursuant to Section 110 of the 2018 Act.  By way of background in this regard, under Part 6 of the 2018 Act, the Commission has the power to commence an inquiry on several bases, including on foot of a complaint, or of its own volition.  \n\n1.17 In his consideration of the material gathered during the initial stages of this Inquiry, the Investigator was satisfied that Facebook constitutes a data controller and that the processing referred to in the Complaint constitutes cross-border processing, such that the Commission is the lead supervisory authority as set out in the GDPR. I make my decision in this regard below.\n\n## REFERRAL BY AUSTRIAN DPA\n\n1.18 The Complaint was referred to the Commission by the Austrian DPA on the basis that (i) the Complaint concerns cross-border processing and (ii) Facebook, as the data controller, has its main establishment in Ireland. In this regard, the Austrian DPA forwarded the Complaint to the Commission on 30 May 2018. The Commission assessed the Complaint and as lead supervisory authority, commenced the Inquiry under Section 110 of the 2018 Act on 20 August 2018. The Parties were also notified of the commencement of the Inquiry on 20 August 2018. \n\n## STATUS OF NOYB\n\n1.19 NOYB is acting as a representative of a named individual in accordance with Article 80 GDPR, which states that:\n\n“_The data subject shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects’ rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf…_”\n\n1.20 For the purposes of assessing compliance with Article 80 GDPR, it is necessary to assess whether NOYB was a properly constituted not-for-profit body with objectives in the public interest and that was actively engaged in “_the field of the protection of data subject rights_”. In this regard, the Investigator consulted NOYB’s website, and NOYB’s articles of association, which explain that it is a “_verein_” (association) under Austrian law. Having reviewed paragraphs 91-96 of the Final Report and Appendix 4 of the Final Report (NOYB’s articles of association), I am satisfied that NOYB meets the definition set out in Article 80 GDPR.  NOYB is a not-for-profit body that appears on its face (although the Commission has no specific competence to rule in this regard) to be validly constituted in accordance with Austrian law, with objectives which are in the public interest. From having reviewed this information, I am also satisfied that NOYB is active in the field of the protection\n\nof data subject rights. On this basis, I am satisfied that these all meet the definition in Article 80 GDPR.\n\n1.21 Moreover, it is necessary to determine the validity of the data subject’s mandate in order to decide whether NOYB may represent them. I am satisfied, having reviewed paragraphs 98-101 of the Final Report and Appendix 3 of the Final Report (the data subject’s “mandate”) that the mandate provided to NOYB by the data subject was lawful, and that therefore NOYB has the right to represent the data subject in this matter. The mandate includes the name, address and signature of the data subject being represented by NOYB. I note, as was noted by the Investigator, that the mandate specifically refers to “_forced consent to the update privacy policy that I clicked on to in May 2018_”. On an objective reading of this mandate, NOYB was given authority to represent the data subject in relation to alleged infringements of the GDPR concerning agreement to the Terms of Service and Data Policy.\n\n1.22 I have also considered “Attachment F” to the Complainant’s submissions on the Draft Report i.e. an affidavit (sworn statement). This affidavit, sworn on 3 September 2019, states that, in the data subject’s view, NOYB has the authority to represent them “_in all matters and in all arguments and legal claims against Facebook according to Article 80 GDPR_”. My view is that this cannot alter, _post hoc_, the nature of the data subject mandate that was provided to NOYB in accordance with Article 80 GDPR to launch a complaint on its behalf. The nature of the Complaint was specified and detailed in the mandate. However, as the scope of the Complaint as I propose to find below does not, in my view, conflict with the mandate, the question of whether “Attachment F” can broaden the scope of NOYB’s mandate is moot. \n\n1.23 Facebook expressed no particular view on NOYB’s status under Article 80 GDPR, or on the data subject’s mandate.\n\n## PROCEDURAL CONDUCT OF INQUIRY\n\n1.24 As set out above, the Inquiry was commenced on 20 August 2018 for the purposes of examining and assessing the circumstances surrounding the Complaint as referred to the Commission by the Austrian DPA, with a view to ultimately facilitating a decision under Section 113(2)(a) of the Act.\n\n1.25 The Commission commenced the Inquiry as it was “_of the opinion that one or more provisions of the_ [2018] _Act and/or the GDPR may have been contravened in relation to the personal data of the data subject who is represented by the Complainant pursuant to Art. 80(1) GDPR…_”[[269]](#_ftn269) The Commission formed this view on the basis of the contents of the Complaint and the arguments it sets out. The Parties were informed of the commencement of the Inquiry by letters dated 20 August 2018. The letter to Facebook set out that the scope of the Inquiry would encompass the contents of the Complaint. The letter also set out a number of queries for Facebook. \n\n1.26 Facebook responded to these queries by way of correspondence, with an attached schedule and appendices, on 27 September 2018.\n\n1.27 Following this, the Investigator wrote to the Complainant on 23 November 2018 to set out his views on the scope of the Complaint. In this context, a number of procedural issues were raised by the Complainant in correspondence dated 3 December 2018. These issues consisted of an allegation of delay on the part of the Commission, and an allegation of bias on the part of the Commission, and a rejection of the interpretation of the Complaint’s scope proposed by the Investigator. The Investigator responded to the Complainant on 16 January 2019 refuting the allegations in strong terms. A further phone call took place between the Investigator and Mr. Maximilian Schrems, a representative of the Complainant, on 26 January 2019, in this regard.\n\n1.28 The Investigator wrote to Facebook on 25 January 2019 to set out his views on the scope of the Complaint, in the same manner as set out in the letter to the Complainant on 23 November 2018. Facebook raised a number of preliminary procedural queries with the Investigator by letter dated 5 February 2019. Facebook enquired as to whether its submissions of 27 September 2018 would be taken into account in circumstances where it was of the view that these submissions extended beyond the scope as set out by the Investigator in the letter of 25 January 2019. Facebook also sought assurances in respect of the confidentiality of information provided in submissions to the Commission, and queried how information would be shared with concerned supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 60 GDPR.\n\n1.29 The Investigator responded to Facebook’s query on 8 February 2019, and confirmed that Facebook’s submission of 27 September 2018 would be taken into account. Furthermore, the Investigator informed Facebook that it would consider the matter of confidentiality of material in the context of the Article 60 Process by way of separate correspondence. The Investigator also asked Facebook to set out clearly any material that it regarded as confidential and/or commercially sensitive in any submissions to the Commission, including the submissions of 27 September 2018 in this Inquiry.\n\n1.30 Facebook corresponded further with the Commission on 13 February 2019 seeking confirmation that aspects of the submission of 27 September 2018 that did not fall within the scope of the Complaint as set out the Investigator’s letter of 25 January 2019 would not be taken into account. Facebook also sought an extension to the deadline (which was 15 February 2019) that had been set for submissions in the Investigator’s letter of 25 January 2019. The Investigator wrote to Facebook on 15 February 2019 confirming that the extension would be granted and asking Facebook to specify any part of the submission of 27 September 2018 that it argued should not be taken into account.\n\n1.31 In response to the letter of 25 January 2019, Facebook sent its submissions on 22 February 2019,  in accordance with the extension of time provided by the Investigator. The Complainant was informed of same. On 23 March 2019, the Complainant wrote to the Commission to request an update as to progress, which was provided by the Investigator on 28 March 2019. That letter set out the procedure that would be followed in terms of the preparation of a Draft Report, the Final Report, and the decision-making process.\n\n1.32 Mr Schrems raised a number of concerns with the Investigator in a phone conversation on 1 April 2019.  Further to this, the Complainant wrote to the Investigator on 19 April 2019 to set out the concerns in writing. These concerns related to dealing directly with the Commission in circumstances where the Complaint was lodged with the Austrian DPA, as well as concerns surrounding the applicability of Irish procedural law as opposed to Austrian procedural law, and conflicts between Irish procedural law and Austrian procedural law. These concerns were also raised by the Complainant in its submissions on the Draft Report and were addressed in the Final Report. I address these concerns and procedural issues below.\n\n1.33 Having completed the Draft Report, the Investigator furnished the parties with a copy of the Draft Report on 28 June 2019. Facebook’s submissions on the Draft Report were received by the Investigator on 28 July 2019, and the Complainant’s submissions on same were received by the Investigator on 9 September 2019. The Investigator proceeded to prepare the Final Report.\n\n1.34 As has already been outlined, Facebook asserted confidentiality over some material sent to the Commission in the context of its submissions during the course of the Inquiry. The Complainant argued that it was entitled to view the material, and also formally requested access to the entire investigation file. Facebook subsequently expressed its willingness to share all relevant material with the Complainant on a voluntary basis. I have considered the issues surrounding the confidentiality dispute in the correspondence between the parties. I am satisfied that no additional issues of confidentiality arise in circumstances where no specific issues of commercial sensitivity have been identified by Facebook in response to such requests, aside from Facebook’s position that the ongoing Inquiry is, in general, a confidential process. \n\n1.35 The Parties were furnished with each other’s submissions on the Draft Report, for their information. The Final Report was provided to me as decision-maker on 4 April 2020.\n\n1.36 In terms of its contents, the Final Report sets out the factual background, and the scope and legal basis, for the Inquiry.  It also provides an outline of the facts as established during the course of the Inquiry, an outline of the dispute about the scope of the Inquiry and the Investigator’s view on same, and an outline of the procedural disputes that arose during the Inquiry and the Investigator’s view on same.  The Final Report further sets out the Investigator’s views as to whether, in respect of these matters, Facebook complied with its obligations under GDPR and the 2018 Act.\n\n1.37 A draft of this Schedule and the Preliminary Draft Decision, i.e. a draft of this decision prepared to enable to parties to make submissions, were sent to the parties on 14 May 2021. The parties furnished the Commission with submissions on that Preliminary Draft Decision and the draft of the Schedule, which I have taken account of in preparing this Schedule and the Decision. The Complainant was not furnished with the section of the Preliminary Draft Decision that addressed the envisaged action i.e. what corrective powers would be imposed, as this is a matter for the Commission and not something that falls within the framework of a complaint pursuant to Article 77 GDPR.\n\n1.38 As for any alleged failure to hear the complainant on the question of corrective powers, my view is that this is simply not a matter for a complainant. A complaint consists of an allegation that unlawful processing is taking place, and therefore is an allegation of an infringement. The question of a corrective power e.g. an administrative fine is solely within the competence of the Commission. \n\n1.39 The Complainant, in this regard, provided the example of a ban on unlawful processing as something a Complainant should be heard in relation to.[[270]](#_ftn270) In making this argument, the Complainant points out that the Complaint in fact seeks a specific “remedy”, i.e. the ending of all processing that the Complainant believes to be unlawful.301\n\n1.40 It must be acknowledged, however, that the position adopted in the Preliminary Draft Decision was that no unlawful processing had been identified by the Complainant, and the proposed infringements related to transparency rather than to the processing of data. As such, it must logically follow that the Commission was not proposing a ban on any processing, given that the Preliminary Draft Decision did not propose to find that any unlawful processing was actually taking place. In this regard, even if there were merit to this argument in some particular circumstances, it was clearly not applicable in the context in which it was made. \n\n1.41 Furthermore, in circumstances where the Commission was minded to find that unlawful processing was taking place, the position of the Complainant in this regard is abundantly clear. Were the Commission not minded to ban any such processing, the Complainant’s position is clearly that it should. If the Commission were minded to ban it, the Complainant has made it clear that it would agree with the decision. In that sense, the Complainant has in fact been heard in no uncertain terms in relation to the question of whether any processing (the processing in question being considered in detail in the accompanying Decision) should be banned. \n\n1.42 What has happened is that the Complainant has not been furnished with, and given the opportunity to make submissions on, the section of the Preliminary Draft Decision that proposed an administrative fine, something which is not a matter for the Complainant in any event. As I have set out, the Preliminary Draft Decision did not propose to find that any unlawful processing was taking\n\nplace. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the section of the Preliminary Draft Decision the Complainant was not provided with would not (and indeed could not) propose banning processing. Therefore even taking this particular argument of the Complainant at its height, it is not applicable in these circumstances.\n\n1.43 Moreover, the Complainant was afforded a right to be heard on the impact any alleged unlawful processing had on her, which is a factor to be considered in the imposition of an administrative fine under Article 83(2)(a) GDPR. This provided the Complainant with an opportunity to speak to the only factor in my consideration of which the Complainant has direct experience.\n\n1.44 For the above reasons, these suggestions on the part of the Complainant’s representative to the effect that it was not afforded a full right to be heard in relation to this inquiry are either ill-founded or based on mischaracterisations of fact and law. \n\n### 4    Procedural Issues to be Decided\n\n2.1 As set out above, this is the Schedule to the Decision made by the Commission, (at this point, I note that I am the sole member of the Commission) in accordance with Section 113 of the 2018 Act.  Section 113 of the 2018 Act provides as follows: \n\n_(2)_  _Where section 109 (4)(a) applies, the Commission shall—_\n\n_(a)_    _in accordance with subsection (3), make a draft decision in respect of the complaint (or, as the case may be, part of the complaint) and, where applicable, as to the envisaged action to be taken in relation to the controller or processor concerned, and_\n\n_(b)_    _in accordance with Article 60 and, where appropriate, Article 65, adopt its decision in respect of the complaint or, as the case may be, part of the complaint._\n\n_(3)_  _In making a draft decision under subsection (2)(a), the Commission shall, where applicable, have regard to—_  \n\n_(a)_                _the information obtained by the Commission in its examination of the complaint, including, where an inquiry has been conducted in respect of the complaint, the information obtained in the inquiry, and_ \n\n_(b)_                _any draft for a decision that is submitted to the Commission by a supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(4)._ \n\n_(4)_  _Where the Commission adopts a decision under subsection (2)(b) to the effect that an infringement by the controller or processor concerned has occurred or is occurring, it shall, in addition, make a decision—_ \n\n_(a) where an inquiry has been conducted in respect of the complaint—_\n\n_(i)_                  _as to whether a corrective power should be exercised in respect of the controller or processor concerned, and_\n\n_(ii)_                 _where it decides to so exercise a corrective power, the corrective power that is to be exercised,_\n\n2.2          In accordance with Section 113, it is for me, as the sole member of the Commission, to consider the information obtained in the course of the Inquiry; to decide whether an infringement is occurring or has occurred; and if so, to decide on the envisaged action in respect of the controller (if any). In so doing, I will carry out an independent assessment of all of the materials provided to me by the Investigator.  \n\n2.3          Given that the Commission is the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) GDPR for the purposes of the data processing operations at issue, I was obliged under Section 113(2) and Article 60(3) GDPR to complete the Draft Decision and provide it to the CSAs, as defined in Article 4(22).  \n\n2.4          As set out above at paragraph 1.1, this concerns my Decision, having submitted the Draft Decision under Article 60(3) GDPR to the CSAs, and having taken account of the Article 65 Decision, as explained in the text of the Decision itself. The purpose of the Draft Schedule and the Preliminary Draft Decision were to allow the parties to make any submissions in respect of my provisional findings set out.  This is the finalised version of the Schedule and Decision, as also explained in further detail in the Decision. \n\n## DECISION-MAKING PROCESS – MATERIALS CONSIDERED\n\n2.5 The Final Report was transmitted to me on 4 April 2020, together with the Investigator’s file, containing copies of all correspondence exchanged between the Investigator and the Parties; and copies of any submissions made by the Parties, including the submissions made by the Parties in respect of the Investigator’s Draft Report. A letter then issued to the Parties on 17 April 2020 to confirm the commencement of the decision-making process.  \n\n2.6 As decision-maker, I must be satisfied that Facebook is a controller within the meaning of the GDPR, that the Commission has competence in respect of this Inquiry, and that fair procedures have been followed throughout the Inquiry. As I have set out above, a number of procedural complaints were made by NOYB throughout the Inquiry process. These issues are addressed in this Schedule.\n\n2.7 The Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision took issue with this approach. It was argued that this breached the Complainant’s right to be heard.[[271]](#_ftn271) It was also argued that the use of the term “materials considered” suggested that there must be some materials that the Commission did not consider.[[272]](#_ftn272) For the avoidance of doubt, I have considered all material submitted to me by the Parties, and the entire file in general. There is no question of any breach of the Complainant’s right to be heard.\n\n## FACEBOOK AS CONTROLLER\n\n2.8 In commencing the Inquiry, the Investigator was satisfied that Facebook is the controller, within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, in respect of the personal data that was the subject of the Complaint. In this regard, Facebook confirmed that it was the controller for data processing in the European Union in a letter to the Commission dated 25 May 2018, appended to the Investigator’s Final Report (“the **Final Report**”) at Appendix 8.\n\n2.9          The concept of controllership is defined in Article 4(7) GDPR which states that a controller is \n\n“_the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law_”.\n\n2.10 In considering whether Facebook is a controller within the EU for the purposes of the GDPR, I note that Facebook’s Dublin office constitutes Facebook’s International Headquarters, and that Facebook had approximately 1,300 direct employees and several thousand further indirect employees working for their Dublin office at the time of the preparation of the Preliminary Draft Decision.[[273]](#_ftn273) Amongst these employees are key data protection personnel, including Facebook’s Head of Data Protection and Associate General Counsel. In the context of the Commission’s work as Ireland’s data protection regulator, it has become clear that Facebook determines the purposes and means of data processing through its role as a global centre of decision-making within Facebook companies generally, and particularly in relation to the processing of personal data. I am therefore satisfied that it is a data controller for European (and, indeed, EMEA) users as defined by Article 4(7) GDPR.\n\n2.11 In relation to the work of the Commission, and my work as Commissioner, it is clear to me based on direct experience that decisions in relation to the purposes and means of data processing for European data subjects are made by Facebook Ireland Limited (“**Facebook**”). I note the submissions made by Facebook on 27 September 2018, in which it stated that it “…_is both responsible for, and has the power to make, decisions about the purposes and means of processing of personal data from EU data subjects…”_.[[274]](#_ftn274) Moreover, the submission stated that:\n\n“_Facebook Ireland is the service provider of the Service in the EU and also determines the purposes and means of processing EU users’ data. It is the only entity with decision-making power regarding:_\n\n•  _Setting polices governing how EU user data is processed;_\n\n•  _Deciding whether and how our products that involve processing of user data will be offered in the EU;_\n\n•  _Controlling the access to and use of EU user data; and_\n\n•  _Handling and resolving data-related inquiries and complaints from European users of the Service whether directly or indirectly via regulators._”[[275]](#_ftn275)\n\n2.12 By way of a specific recent example, the Commission attended Facebook’s Dublin office in order to inspect documents relating to the roll-out of a dating feature. This roll-out was delayed as a result of concerns expressed by the Commission about the compliance of the feature with data protection law. In the context of this inspection, it was clear that decisions in relation to this data processing were made by Facebook, just as other such decisions have been made in the past, and are made on a daily basis. For these reasons, I am in agreement with the Investigator, and find that Facebook is a data controller as defined by Article 4(7) GDPR. Specifically, I am satisfied that Facebook is the data controller for users in the European Union. \n\n## COMPETENCE OF THE COMMISSION  \n\n2.13 Pursuant to Article 56(1) GDPR, “_the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor_”. It follows that the Commission is only competent to act as the lead supervisory authority if (i) Facebook’s main or single establishment in the Union is located is Ireland, and (ii) there is cross-border processing as defined in the GDPR. \n\n2.14 I will first consider whether Facebook is the main or single establishment of the Facebook group within the Union. The term “main establishment” in respect of a controller, is defined in Article 4(16) GDPR as _“…the place of its central administration in the Union_” where “_decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken._”\n\n2.15 Facebook confirmed to the Commission, in a letter of 25 May 2018 at Appendix 8 of the Final Report: “…_we wish to formally confirm that the following controllers will have their main establishment in the European Union in Ireland: Facebook Ireland Limited_…”. Furthermore, having reviewed the Directors’ Report and Financial Statements most recently filed on behalf of Facebook with the Companies Registration Office (in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2018), I note that page 3 of the Directors’ Report confirms that:\n\n“_Facebook Ireland Limited (“the company”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook International Operations Limited, which is its immediate parent and controlling party. Facebook International Operations is incorporated in the Republic of Ireland and its ultimate parent is Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”), a company incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America._”\n\n2.16   In their submissions of 27 September 2018, Facebook submitted that:\n\n“_Facebook Ireland has more than_  _personnel at its headquarters in Dublin who manage, among other things, the operations and data processing relating to EU users, including the analysis and exercise of those users’ rights, information security including user information security, engineering, user support, law enforcement response, data protection and privacy operations and policy and legal teams including, critically, the data protection teams. Facebook Ireland’s senior decision makers operate in cross-functional teams, which include representatives from its Legal, Policy, Law Enforcement Response, Community Operations, Information Security, and Privacy Operations. The DPO and his office provide oversight of these teams and their work. These decision makers formulate user data processing policies and oversee the implementation of these policies in respect of users of the Service in the EU. On a daily basis, Facebook Ireland’s personnel are responsible for managing the personal data of EU users and determining the means and purposes of processing this personal data._”[[276]](#_ftn276)\n\n2.17 In this regard, I further note that the Investigator, and the Commission generally, was satisfied, in commencing the Inquiry, that Facebook was the main establishment in the European Union within the meaning of Article 56(1) GDPR. I further note that nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that the position, in this regard, has changed since I considered it in the context of the preparation of the Preliminary Draft Decision. \n\n2.18 As I have already observed, Facebook’s headquarters in Dublin constitutes Facebook’s International Headquarters. Moreover, I have already found, for the reasons set out above, that decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken by Facebook. For these reasons and the reasons already set out above, I am satisfied that Facebook Ireland is\n\nFacebook’s place of central administration in the Union.  I am also satisfied, on the information available to me, that decisions which relate to the means and purposes of data processing are made by Facebook.\n\n2.19      To turn to cross-border processing, cross-border processing is defined in Article 4(23) GDPR as either:\n\n_“(a) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State;  or_\n\n_(b) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State_.”\n\n2.20 In its submissions dated 27 September 2018, Facebook confirmed that “_Facebook Ireland provides the Service to hundreds of millions of users across the EU and in doing so is engaged in crossborder processing pursuant to Article 4(23) GDPR._”[[277]](#_ftn277) \n\n2.21 I also note that the Investigator was satisfied that there was cross-border processing carried out by Facebook (within the meaning of Article 4(23) GDPR), in relation to the personal data that was the subject of the Complaint.309  Given the scale of Facebook’s operations across the European Union outlined above, I am satisfied that there is cross-border processing as defined in the GDPR for the purposes of this Complaint.\n\n2.22 I am satisfied based on the above evidence secured through publicly available sources, information voluntarily provided by Facebook, and information acquired by the Commission in the course of conducting investigations, that Facebook is the data controller for EU users and is the organisation’s place of central administration in the Union. I am also satisfied, for the reasons set out above, that this Complaint concerns cross-border processing. I therefore agree with the Investigator that Facebook meets the definition of “main establishment” in Article 4(16) GDPR, and that therefore the Commission is competent to act as lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 GDPR.\n\n## ISSUES OF AUSTRIAN LAW\n\n2.23 The next procedural issue is an overarching point that is relevant to each of the other individual points raised by the Complainant, and so I will consider this point before considering the other points in turn. This Complaint was lodged with the Austrian DPA, who then transferred the Complaint to the Commission as lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 GDPR. The Commission then launched a statutory inquiry in accordance with Irish law. The Complainant, however, argues that because the Complaint itself was lodged with the Austrian DPA in Austria, the Complaint must be handled in accordance with the procedural laws of both Austria and Ireland. The Complainant’s representative has initiated legal proceedings in Austria against the Austrian DPA in this regard (“the **Austrian Proceedings**”).\n\n2.24 Briefly, and by way of background, the Austrian Proceedings arise out of a formal complaint made by the Complainant to the Austrian DPA (“the **Austrian Complaint**”). The Austrian Complaint argues that the Commission has contravened Austrian law by not adhering to the relevant procedural rules and not applying Austrian contract law to this Complaint. The Complainant also argues that the Commission has contravened Austrian law by not considering certain matters that the Complainant deems to be within the scope of the Complaint. On this basis and others (which are not directly relevant for these purposes), the Complainant asks that the Austrian DPA lift a suspension currently in operation on its handling of the Complaint so that it can also deal with that same Complaint. The Austrian DPA rejected these arguments for a number of reasons, including that it cannot act while the Commission’s procedures are ongoing. The Complainant has appealed this decision of the Austrian DPA in the Austrian courts, resulting in the Austrian Proceedings.\n\n2.25 The Complainant made similar arguments in its submissions to the Investigator,[[278]](#_ftn278) and specifically argues that the applicable procedural law is the _Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrengesetz_ (“the **AVG**”), Austria’s code of administrative procedure. It is the Complainant’s view that the AVG permits the alteration of the scope of a procedure in particular circumstances, and seeks to rely on this in order to dispute the Investigator’s view of the scope of the Complaint, and to alter that scope. My decision on procedural matters relating to the scope of the Complaint is considered in detail below, and at this point I am solely considering the applicability or otherwise of the AVG to the actions of the Commission in general.\n\n2.26 As the decision-maker at the Commission, I take no view on the Complainant’s characterisation of the AVG or of any other questions of Austrian law. The Commission was established in Ireland by the 2018 Act, thereby meeting Ireland’s obligations to establish such an authority under Article 51 (and Chapter VI generally) GDPR, given it is directly applicable in Ireland pursuant to Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Section 12 of the 2018 Act provides a number of functions for the Commission “i_n addition to the functions assigned to the Commission by virtue of its being the supervisory authority for the purposes of the Data Protection Regulation_”. \n\n2.27 Chapter VI of the GDPR sets out in detail the responsibilities and powers of supervisory authorities. While it is not necessary to set out Chapter VI here, it is noteworthy that Article 51(1) GDPR states that “[e]_ach Member States shall provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation_” [my emphasis]. Moreover, Section 12\n\nof the 2018 Act does not confer any powers on the Commission in respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction. \n\n2.28 The powers of the Commission must be limited to those conferred on it by law. The Commission is tasked with encouraging, monitoring and enforcing compliance with the GDPR. In that context it is, like all other public authorities in the State, bound by the administrative law of Ireland and EU law, including EU law on fair procedures and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Further, as I stated above, Article 56(1) GDPR sets out that “_the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority_”. \n\n2.29  The Commission therefore derives its legal authority to handle the Complaint from the GDPR and the 2018 Act, and is, in that regard, bound by the legal order set out above. The Commission is not bound, nor must it have regard to, the administrative law of Austria, or of any other jurisdiction. Moreover, it seems to me that not only does the administrative law of Austria not bind the Commission, but that any attempt by the Commission to apply such law would be plainly _ultra vires_ the powers conferred on the Commission by law.\n\n2.30 The parties were afforded an opportunity to address the provisional conclusions reached in the Schedule to the Preliminary Draft Decision. In making the argument that this position was “_an archaic and purely nationalistic idea of international law_”, the Complainant’s submissions advance the position that, while the Commission operates under Irish and EU law, it must at times interpret the AVG. This is said to include interpreting and applying Austrian law in order to determine the scope of the complaint.[[279]](#_ftn279) It is also argued that the Commission has failed to cooperate with the Austrian DPA by asking for clarifications on the nature of the law.\n\n2.31 To address the latter issue first, the Commission has cooperated in full with the Austrian DPA throughout this Inquiry. \n\n2.32 In relation to the possible application of Austrian procedural law, at no point do the Complainant’s submissions point to any legal authority for the proposition that the Commission must interpret and apply aspects of Austrian procedural law to this Complaint, beyond the citation of the provisions of Austrian law themselves which are said to be relevant. The Commission has not sought clarifications on Austrian procedural law given the Commission does not accept, and has not been presented with any legal authority for, the suggestion that it must apply, interpret, or in any way consider the procedural law of Austria. \n\n2.33 No further distinct argument was made to elaborate on why Austrian law would be applicable to any procedure being conducted by an Irish supervisory authority in Ireland. The Commission is established under Irish law, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018, and must exercise its functions under and in accordance with the 2018 Act and applicable EU law, including, in particular, the GDPR. This being so, I find that I am not obliged to apply Austrian procedural law in the exercise of my functions in this Inquiry. Indeed, it must be open to doubt whether the Commission would ever have jurisdiction or competence to do so.\n\n## ALLEGATION OF BIAS\n\n2.34 As has been set out above, the Complainant wrote to the Investigator on 3 December 2018 raising a number of procedural issues, including an allegation of bias on the part of the Commission, which I will address here. I will subsequently address the Complainant’s allegation that the manner in which the Commission dealt with the scope of the Complaint was contrary to its right to fair procedures, before considering the substantive question of the scope of the Complaint under examination. \n\n2.35 In the letter dated 3 December 2018, the Complainant alleged that there had been prior “approval” by the Commission of the legal bases used by Facebook for processing personal data. This was based in part on a statement made in Vienna’s _Landesgericht_ (Regional Court) that the “_used legal basis for the processing of data under GDPR was developed under extended regulatory involvement by the_ [Commission] _in multiple personal meetings between November 2017 and July 2018_”.[[280]](#_ftn280) In the letter, the Complainant stated that “[t}_his does not just raise questions about your claim that you have to “investigate” and “inquire”_ [sic.] _this matter – when in fact you have already negotiated with the Facebook Group about these legal and factual questions between 2017 and 2018, but raises issues about an obvious bias of a decision maker that has previously approved the criticized mechanism._”[[281]](#_ftn281)\n\n2.36 In the same letter, the Complainant referred to the existence of a rule against bias in both Ireland and in Austria, but did not elaborate on its legal views of the nature of the test in either jurisdiction, and did not present any arguments explaining why, in its view, the Commission had acted in a manner that contravened any such test. Moreover, the Complainant offered no evidence to substantiate the factually inaccurate claim that the Commission “previously approved” the “mechanism” in question or to substantiate the allegation that the consultation process gave rise to the apprehension of bias.\n\n2.37 The Investigator responded to this and other allegations in a letter dated 16 January 2019. The Investigator correctly observed that the allegations of bias were unsubstantiated, and confirmed that “[the Commission] _does not and never has, endorsed, jointly developed, approved or in any other way assented or consented to a controller’s or processor’s policies or position in relation to compliance with its data protection obligations._” It was clarified that the interactions referred to by the Complainant were for the purpose of “_being updated…and being providing high level feedback_” to both Facebook and to a large number of other private and public sector organisations with which the Commission interacts as part of its “_consultation and engagement with regulatory stakeholders.”_  I agree with the Investigator’s view just set out, for the reasons which I have set out above.\n\n2.38 I also note and agree with the Investigator’s statement in the same letter that outlined the Commission’s statutory obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, which were in force at the time. This also applies, as was pointed out by the Investigator, under Article 57 GDPR. The Commission implements these obligations to promote awareness of data protection law by maintaining an active consultation function. The Investigator also clarified that the Commission “_makes it abundantly clear to any organisation that seeks to consult with it that this is the premise upon which consultation takes place and that it is entirely a matter for that organisation to ensure that it is in compliance with data protection law._” This is, in my view, an accurate characterisation of the position. In a subsequent telephone call with staff of the Commission on 25 January 2019, Mr. Schrems, raised the matter of bias once again. At this point, a Deputy Commissioner at the\n\nCommission, reiterated the DPC’s position, in this regard, to Mr. Schrems.[[282]](#_ftn282)\n\n2.39 This issue of bias was not raised again until the Complainant furnished the Investigator with submissions on the Draft Report dated 9 September 2019. For the sake of completeness, the entirety of the Complainant’s submission, in this regard, is set out below:\n\n“_Since it follows from Facebook's submission (e.g. page 2 of the submissions of 27. 9. 2018) that the Irish DPC even worked out (!) the procedure criticised in the complaint together with Facebook in ten sessions, the problem of bias is once again drawn to attention._\n\n_It seems difficult to imagine, for example, that the authority could make use of its power to issue penalties if it had worked on the punishable conduct with Facebook in advance. This also gives rise to a potential conflict with the GDPR, which provides in Article 83(1) for \"effective, proportionate and dissuasive\" penalties._\n\n_We do not yet know how the Irish authority intends to take case [sic.] of this problem and we expressly reserve the right to appeal any decision on this basis.”[**[283]**](#_ftn283)_\n\n2.40 As is evident from this quotation, the Complainant offered no specific evidence in respect of this unsubstantiated allegation that “_the Irish DPC even worked out(!) the procedure criticised in the complaint together with Facebook_”. Moreover, no reference is made to the Commission’s clarification that no approval or authorisation for the Terms of Service was provided to Facebook by the Commission. The premise of the Complainant’s argument, as had already been pointed out by the Investigator, is incorrect. The reference to “meetings” in Facebook’s submissions cited by\n\nthe Complainant in the above quotation is the only reference to the Commission’s consultation function in any submissions made by Facebook in relation to this Inquiry.  The reference is as follows:\n\n“_We have drafted this response against the background of our detailed direct engagement with the Commission prior to the implementation of the recent update to our terms, spanning 10 meetings, which covered many of the issues responded to herein. Facebook Ireland has not materially changed its compliance approach since these meetings._”\n\n2.41 It is clear that this is a reference to a consultative process, and at no point does Facebook assert that the Terms of Service were approved or endorsed by the DPC; it is merely asserted that these Terms of Service have not changed since a consultation process took place. Facebook would of course not be entitled to rely on remarks made in such meetings. In addition, it is not clear to me how Facebook can be said to be using the above statement to support its legal position, or indeed any argument, in relation to the Inquiry. For the purpose of providing additional context, I also emphasise that this quotation is taken from a two-page covering letter preceding submissions to the Commission in the context of the Inquiry as opposed to being extracted from the body of such submissions to the Commission.\n\n2.42 Finally, this matter was raised, indirectly, in the form of an “open letter” published by NOYB and sent to other European Data Protection Authorities and to the European Data Protection Board (“the **EDPB**”). In this letter, public allegations were made about the Commission’s cooperation with what the Complainant calls Facebook’s “consent bypass”.[[284]](#_ftn284) To the extent that this letter directly addresses the allegation of bias at all, it once again proceeds on the false factual premise that that Facebook “_simply followed the_ [Commission]_’s advice._” It is further alleged that this renders the Commission’s processes “_structurally biased because it is essentially reviewing its own legal advice_”. It has already been clarified above that, contrary to this assertion, the Commission did not approve any such mechanism, nor did it provide legal advice to Facebook. It has also been clarified that Facebook has in fact not sought to rely on such consultations in this Inquiry.\n\n2.43 In the open letter, it was alleged that “[k]_eeping these meetings confidential is only adding to the impression that the_ [Commission] _and Facebook have engaged in a relationship that is inappropriate for a neutral and independent oversight authority._”[[285]](#_ftn285) Aside from the fact that the Commission’s consultation function is widely publicised, such an allegation has no basis in law. The relevant facts have been provided to the Complainant by the Commission on multiple occasions, and a reasonable and objective explanation of those facts has been provided to the Complainant by the Commission on multiple occasions. \n\n2.44 It is factually not the case that the Commission endorsed or approved of the Terms of Service and Data Policy of Facebook or indeed of any other organisation. Moreover, irrespective of any feedback that may or may not have been provided to Facebook or any other organisation, the Commission always emphasises that the consultation function is entirely distinct from any statutory inquiries, investigations, or decisions of the Commission. I also emphasise that this decision-making process is also functionally independent of the procedure conducted by the Investigator that led to the Final Report, just as the statutory inquiries are functionally independent from any and all consultations with the Commission. The factual premise of the allegation is incorrect, and the test for bias has not been met. \n\n2.45 The parties were afforded an opportunity to address the provisional conclusions reached in the Schedule to the Preliminary Draft Decision. The Complainant disagrees that no evidence of bias has been provided, and points to a statement made in an Austrian court by a representative of Facebook. That statement consists of the quotation in paragraph 2.32 above. I have set out my views on that statement. The Complainant goes on to argue that “[t]_he DPC has also never provided any evidence, memo or other evidence to substantiate its claims that these meetings did not have the substance that Facebook alleged_”.[[286]](#_ftn286) This does not in any way the substantiate the serious allegation of bias made by the Complainant.  \n\n2.46 Firstly it has not been denied by the Commission or Facebook that “_these meetings did not have the substance that Facebook alleged_”. The presence of engagement and consultation does not of course, in and of itself, suggest approval of any kind. Any decision by Facebook, or an individual employee of Facebook, to reference such meetings in the context of defending particular practices is a matter for Facebook. In this regard, it is relevant to note that the Commission is not party to the Austrian proceedings referred to by the Complainant. To the extent that Facebook seeks to rely on or has ever relied on any consultative process with the Commission in order to defend the lawfulness of a particular practice, this has been in error. More pertinently, for present purposes, Facebook makes no such argument in the context of this Complaint. This is because the Commission never provided any such approval in this case nor does it do so in the context of its engagement and consultation role more generally. Unfortunately the Complainant and/or her representative has chosen to rely on one specific isolated statement – in proceedings to which the Commission is not a party - and to make  assumptions on the basis of that statement which do not correspond to the factual position. In circumstances where the allegation of bias has not been substantiated, I must reject that allegation. \n\n2.47      I am therefore satisfied that fair procedures have been followed in this and every regard thus far throughout the Inquiry.\n\n**3.** **T****HE S****COPE OF THE C****OMPLAINT AND I****NQUIRY**\n\n## PROCEDURAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE SCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT\n\n3.1. The question of scope is also considered in the main body of this Decision, and therefore this section is to be read in conjunction with the Decision. The Complainant also alleged that in determining the scope of the Complaint and in not allowing the Complainant to revise the scope of that Complaint, the Commission was acting contrary to the Complainant’s right to fair procedures. In the letter dated 3 December 2018, the Complainant specifically articulated its view that it objected to a “one shot” approach, and instead argued it should be afforded the opportunity to respond to Facebook’s views on the Complaint. These arguments were necessarily linked to the Complainant’s assertion of a right of access to all of Facebook’s submissions to the Commission in respect of this Complaint, an issue which has now been disposed as these submissions have been shared with the Complainant on a voluntary basis, as described above. The Complainant sought to advance the argument that the Commission should engage in an openended inquiry into each individual processing operation carried out by Facebook.\n\n3.2.            In response, in the letter dated 16 January 2019, the Investigator informed the Complainant that:\n\n“_the DPC has identified two main issues (each with associated sub-issues for consideration, as detailed in our most recent communication to you) which are the primary focus of that statutory inquiry. The DPC considers that all data protection matters raised in your complaint fall within these two main issues, as set out in detail in our letter dated 23 November 2018. As such the DPC’s position is that the scope of the current inquiry captures all elements of the Facebook complaint._”\n\n3.3. This matter was not raised again until the Complainant contacted the Investigator by email on 23 March 2019 seeking an update on the status of the Complaint. The Investigator responded by letter dated 28 March 2019. This letter outlined the procedure that would be followed going forward, and the Investigator also reaffirmed that “_the DPC notified NOYB of its view concerning the scope of inquiry C-18-5-5._”\n\n3.4. The Complainant wrote to the Investigator by letter dated 19 April 2019, and addressed the issue of the scope of the Complaint further. The Complainant stated that “_we reserve the right to amend our arguments should one of the controllers seek to depart from the factual or legal premises our complaints were based on._” It was also emphasised, in that regard, that “_the complaints explicitly states that the complaints are based on our knowledge at the time of submission_”. Contrastingly, Facebook argued that the Complaint’s scope should be strictly limited to processing that was Facebook processed on foot of consent.\n\n3.5.             In the Draft Report, the Investigator relied on a statement in the Complaint which read:\n\n“_For practical reasons, the scope of this complaint is explicitly limited to any processing operations that are wholly or partly based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. Our current understanding is, that these are used as bases for all processing operations described in the controller’s privacy policy…_”[[287]](#_ftn287)\n\n3.6. The Investigator went on to consider in detail the contents of the Complaint, including its focus on the Complainant’s view that all data processing pursuant to the data subject’s acceptance of the Terms of Service was based on consent.[[288]](#_ftn288) The Investigator also set out that, in the words of the Complainant, the Complaint rested on a “_preliminary assumption_” that all processing carried out pursuant to the Terms of Service was based on consent or, alternatively, that all processing based on these documents “_simply has no legal basis_”.[[289]](#_ftn289) The Investigator observed that the legal analysis in the Complaint was confined to the issue of consent.[[290]](#_ftn290) \n\n3.7. Having outlined the scope, the Complaint then states that “[n]_evertheless, nothing in this complaint shall indicate that other legal bases the controller may rely on are not equally invalid or may not be equally the subject of subsequent legal actions._”[[291]](#_ftn291) This qualifying remark, while alluding to the fact that the Complainant may have other views in relation to other legal bases for data processing carried out by Facebook, is evidently not one that describes the character of the Complaint in question. While such a remark clearly refers to hypothetical positions the Complainant may have or take in the future, it cannot alter the limiting character of the preceding statement in and of itself. It instead clarifies that the Complainant reserves its position in respect of any other legal bases on which Facebook may or may not rely.\n\n3.8. Having taken an objective reading of the Complaint, the Investigator concluded that the issues that arose were: \n\n•                **Issue (a):** the acceptance of the Terms of Service and/or Data Policy was an act of consent;\n\n•                **Issue (b):** Facebook cannot lawfully rely on necessity for the performance of a contract to process data arising out of the data subject’s acceptance of those same documents; \n\n•                **Issue (c):** Facebook misrepresented the legal basis for processing this data; and \n\n•                **Issue (d):** Facebook failed to provide the necessary information regarding its legal basis for processing this data.\n\n3.9.             In its submissions on the Draft Report, the Complainant argued that “_the DPC believes it can exclude certain questions from the proceedings and arbitrarily determine a scope of procedure_\n\n_based on the hypothetical or guessed will of the complainant_”.[[292]](#_ftn292) The assertion was made that “[i]_t is also not alien to Irish procedural law that a request may be amended if, based on the defendant's submissions, another alleged legal basis for data processing arises_.”[[293]](#_ftn293)\n\n3.10.         The Investigator gave consideration to these submissions and ultimately did not revise his view.[[294]](#_ftn294) Facebook also remained of the view that, contrary to both the view of the Investigator and the Complainant, the Complaint should be strictly limited to data processing carried out, as a matter of fact, on the basis of consent.[[295]](#_ftn295) The Investigator found that it was not necessary to engage in a factual “_trawl_” of each one of Facebook’s processing operations, but instead to carry out a legal and factual analysis based on the objective content of the Complaint itself.[[296]](#_ftn296) This was not based on an assessment of the “will” of the Complainant, hypothetical or otherwise, but simply on an assessment of the content of the Complaint.\n\n3.11.         In submissions on the Schedule to the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant maintained this position. Not only were further arguments made in support of the argument that the Commission has breached the Complainant’s right to fair procedures by misinterpreting the scope of the Complaint, but the Complainant’s submissions also accuse the Commission of either “_simply not understand_[ing] _or read_[ing] _large parts of – or, as it seems to us wilfully mischaracterises the submissions of the Complainan_t”.[[297]](#_ftn297) These most serious accusations are refuted by the Commission in the strongest of terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission has given full consideration to all relevant material, including, but not limited to, all submissions made by the Complainant. The Commission also rejects the unfounded accusations of _mala fides_ that are made in the alternative in this regard.\n\n3.12.         The Complainant also relies on Austrian procedural law in the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision in order to argue that the Complaint should be interpreted in a particular manner. In this regard I reiterate that there is no legal authority for the proposition that the Commission is bound to interpret and apply Austrian procedural law to the Complaint, and further note that the Complainant has been unable to produce such authority despite having ample opportunity to do so. In particular the Complainant argues that the core of the Complaint’s scope is the “remedy” being sought, i.e. a ban on all processing carried out on foot of the “consent bypass”.330 It goes without saying that in order for such a ban to become relevant to any procedure, there must be a finding of a breach of the GDPR on the basis alleged in the first instance. This is why the first step in any such analysis involves considering the infringement in advance of this proposed “remedy”.\n\n3.13.         The Commission, in the Preliminary Draft Decision, considered the allegation that an infringement is taking place in the form of unlawful processing arising from the alleged consent bypass. The Commission has considered further submissions from the Parties in this regard, and formed a view in the Draft Decision. It is difficult to see how the absence of the exercise of a particular corrective power, which necessarily can only be imposed if the Commission finds that an alleged infringement has made out, can be characterised as a failure to deal with the entire scope of a Complaint. \n\n3.14.         The Complainant also alleges that it has been unable to respond to Facebook’s “defence”. The Complainant submits that there has been no opportunity to respond to Facebook’s argument that it actually relies on a different legal basis for processing personal data to the one the Complainant thought it relied on.[[298]](#_ftn298) On the contrary, the Complainant has made extensive submissions on this argument that has been put forward by Facebook, both in its submissions on the Draft Report and in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision. Contrary to what is argued on the Complainant’s behalf, no dispute has been “removed” from scope. Both legal bases that have arisen over the course of this Inquiry are fully considered in the Decision, as they were considered in the Preliminary Draft Decision.\n\n3.15.         I must make an assessment as to whether the Complainant’s specific allegations of procedural unfairness in how this was addressed by the Commission thus far have merit. In the “open letter” to which I have already referred, the Complainant alleged that “_the Investigator departed from the applications that were made in accordance with Austrian procedural law and decided to investigate only certain elements of our complaint and to reinterpret our requests._”[[299]](#_ftn299) \n\n3.16.         It does not seem to me that the above quotation is an accurate characterisation of what has taken place. I have already (as had the Investigator) set out views on why Austrian procedural law does not apply to the activities of the Commission. The merits or otherwise of the Investigator’s objective analysis of the content of the Complaint is addressed later in this section. I do not accept, however, that there is, in principle, a procedural defect in limiting the scope of a complaint-based inquiry to the objective contents of the very Complaint that led the Commission to conduct an Inquiry. As well as conforming to Section 113 of the 2018 Act (set out earlier in this Section of the Schedule), this approach is perfectly logical. \n\n3.17.         The Complainant’s arguments in relation to any alleged procedural defects in the manner in which the scope of the Complaint is to be determined, i.e. by the objective content of the Complaint, are based on Austrian Administrative law, and particularly on the AVG. Insofar as that those arguments are based on Austrian law, for reasons already set out, the Commission cannot consider those arguments, save to the extent that they raise issues of either Irish or EU law. I note\n\nthat Facebook did not make submissions on the issue of the applicability or otherwise of the AVG during this Inquiry.\n\n3.18.         Moreover, as I have set out, the decision to conduct a complaint-based Inquiry arising out of the contents of a Complaint seems to me to be a perfectly logical approach. The alternative would be an open-ended procedure, where the content of a “complaint” would crystallise at some unspecified future date. The inherent problem with such an approach is that it would not amount to an inquiry based on the Complaint which was lodged with the Commission, but would instead be an inquiry directed by the Complainant, with its subject matter and steps dictated on an evolving and ongoing basis by the Complainant. Furthermore, it is unclear how it could be said that such an approach constitutes a complaint that concerns personal data relating to the complainant. This would presumably only occur once a complainant is satisfied of receipt of all information they might require, and has been afforded the opportunity to amend the complaint itself based on the submissions of the other party. \n\n3.19.         The unfairness that could arise from such an approach stems from the fact that it would, in effect, enable a form of _post-hoc_ amendment to an existing complaint over the course of an indefinite period of time, which could only come to an end at a time and in a manner of the Complainant’s choosing. This would not only amount to a fundamentally one-sided approach, but would also alter the character of the inquiry to the extent that it could no longer be described as “complaintbased”, but rather “complainant-led”. \n\n3.20.         This also applies to aspects of the Complaint that either reserve the Complainant’s position or express views on hypothetical investigative and/or corrective powers that, in the Complainant’s personal view, the Commission should exercise. I see no breach of fair procedures in considering the Complaint as a whole in order to determine the exact infringements being alleged. There is no procedural right to make generalised requests to the Commission to either conduct broadbased investigations or exercise particular corrective powers in the context of a complaint. In any case, as I have also set out above, the question of a “remedy”, here a ban on processing (which now is said by the Complainant to be at the core of the Complaint), can only arise when a particular infringement involving unlawful processing has been made out.\n\n3.21.         The Complainant, having lodged the Complaint via the Austrian DPA, responded to the Draft Report, which set out clearly the submissions of Facebook and the Investigator’s views on same. The Complainant will also be afforded the opportunity to make submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision. No suggestion has been made that the alternative procedure proposed by the Complainant is a requirement of Irish law, nor that the procedure that has been followed in relation to the scope breaches any rules of fair procedures in Irish law. Moreover, I am unaware of any case law or statutory provisions in Irish law or EU law that suggests that such an approach is contrary to the Complainant’s right to fair procedures, and the Complainant has not referred to any such law in its submissions.\n\n## SUBSTANTIVE SCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT\n\n3.22. Put in high-level terms, this complaint-based Inquiry concerns the requirement under EU data protection law for any entity collecting and processing personal data to establish “a lawful basis” for the processing under Articles 6 GDPR. This particular Complaint was lodged by reference to Facebook and its lawful basis for processing user personal data and “special category” personal data. I have set out, in summary form, the contents of the Complaint and arguments contained in it at Section 2 of this document. \n\n3.23.     “Personal data” is defined under Article 4(1) GDPR as:\n\n“_any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person_”.\n\n3.24.     Moreover, Article 4(13) GDPR defines the “genetic data” referred to above as:\n\n“_personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question_”.\n\n3.25.     Article 4(14) GDPR defines “biometric data” as:\n\n “_personal_ _data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data_”.\n\n3.26.    Finally, “data concerning health” is defined by Article 4(15) GDPR as:\n\n“_personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status_”.\n\n3.27.     The other special categories or personal data referred to in Article 9 GDPR are not defined in the GDPR.\n\n3.28. As set out above, Article 6 GDPR sets out the lawful bases for the processing of personal data. The provisions of Article 6 that arise in this complaint-based Inquiry are the first two lawful basis listed in the Article, in Articles 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) GDPR. Article 6(1) GDPR states:\n\n_“6. 1 Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:_\n\n_(a)_                _the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;_\n\n_(b)_                _processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;_\n\n_(c)_                 _processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;_\n\n_(d)_                _processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;_\n\n_(e)_                 _processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;_\n\n_(f)_                  _processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child._\n\n_Point (f)f the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.”_\n\n3.29. A number of conditions for consent are enumerated in Article 7 GDPR:\n\n_“1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data._\n\n_2._                   _If the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding._\n\n_3._                   _The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent._\n\n_4._                   _When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.”_\n\n3.30.         Article 13(c) GDPR requires data controllers to provide information to data subjects on “_the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing_”.\n\n3.31.         Article 12(1) GDPR requires that “[t]_he controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14…to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language…_”.\n\n3.32.         Unusual circumstances arise in relation to this Complaint because of its very starting-point, namely, the assertion that clicking on Facebook’s Terms of Service purported to bring all personal data processing under the lawful basis of consent for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. This starting point was rejected in Facebook’s submissions. While the Investigator did not agree with the entirety of Facebook’s submissions by any means, he also rejected this premise.  I also rejected it in the Draft Decision. This rejection of the foundational premise of the Complaint has inevitably rendered the overall subject-matter of the Complaint effectively less cohesive.  \n\n3.33.         The Complaint also refers to processing of special category data covered by Article 9 GDPR. The Complainant’s submissions on the Draft Report make further arguments in this regard, particularly in relation to medical data and in relation to special category data processed by Facebook on the consent of the user (such as facial recognition data). Facebook’s position is that it does not process any special category data arising out of the acceptance of the Terms of Service, but only arising from data for which consent is specifically sought. \n\n3.34.         In the Draft Decision, I expressed the view that, for the reasons set out above and the additional reasons set out below where I make conclusions on the scope of the Complaint, the Complaint even taken at its height quite clearly only concerns data processing arising out of accepting the Terms of Service. The Complainant’s central arguments on “forced consent” are predicated on the assertion by the Complainant that accepting the Terms of Service is forcing a consent to personal data processing for the purposes of the GDPR. Moreover, the Complainant’s representative has made clear that it views the core of the Complaint as asking for a ban on the processing of data being processed on foot of the “consent bypass”. In order to establish an entitlement to such a remedy, it must be established that accepting the Terms of Service results in unlawful data processing. Whether one focuses on the acceptance of the Terms of Service or on the remedy sought, the lawfulness of the processing arising from this acceptance, either pursuant to consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or necessity for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, was, in my view, clearly at the heart of this Complaint.\n\n3.35.         I did not however, in the Draft Decision, accept that the processing of sensitive categories of personal data on the basis of Article 9 GDPR consent fell within the scope of this Inquiry. Facebook undoubtedly does process special category data on the basis of explicit consent under Article 9 GDPR on its platform including in terms of the separate consent collected for its facial recognition feature. I expressed the view, in the Draft Decision, that the Complaint was one about whether the Terms of Service (which is the contract with the user) are a deliberately veiled and inadequate means of forcing consent under GDPR, or whether they are, as Facebook contends, a contract with the user for which certain data processing is necessary in order to perform that contract. \n\n3.36.         The Complaint considered Article 9 GDPR in circumstances where the Complainant was of the view that consent was being sought to process personal data (including special category data). It subsequently came to light that Facebook relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing complained of. The Complainant has presented no evidence to suggest that any of this processing carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR involves processing special category data. As this legal basis is not contained within Article 9 GDPR, such processing would obviously be unlawful if it were taking place. It is denied by the controller that such processing is taking place, no evidence has been presented that it is taking place, and no allegation has been made that it is taking place (aside from in the context of the Complainant’s initial mistaken view that the processing complained of is based on consent). I therefore was unable to see, when preparing the Draft Decision, how Article 9 GDPR properly remained within the scope of this Complaint as it is now understood by the Parties. As set out in paragraph 2.23 of this Decision, the EDPB, in the Article 65 Decision, took a different view, on this particular issue.\n\n3.37.         Having reviewed and considered all of the material submitted by the Complainant, I concluded, in the Draft Decision, that the core of the issues raised by the Complainant were as follows:\n\na.       Accepting the Terms of Service offered by Facebook in April 2018 specifically constituted an act of consent to personal data processing under the GDPR. The precise extent of the processing complained of is unclear in the Complaint. A particular focus was, however, placed on both processing in order to deliver behavioural advertising, and on special category data. The Complainant takes issue with any unlawful processing based on this agreement, whatever that agreement’s legal character might be.[[300]](#_ftn300)\n\nb.       The Complainant argues that 6(1)(a) GDPR, i.e. consent, is the mandatory, default lawful basis for personal data processing where there is a contract or agreement **primarily** concerned with personal data processing.[[301]](#_ftn301) \n\nc.       Consent under the GDPR is simply an indication of agreement by the data subject according to the Complainant. The necessary attributes of freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous are merely “conditions for its validity”, but not features of objective “consent”.\n\nd.       As an alternative to point (a), Facebook is not entitled to rely on the “necessary for the performance of a contract” legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR other than for very limited processing such as friends lists, photo albums, profiles and news. It therefore cannot rely on this as an alternative legal basis to consent for the acceptance of the Terms of Service as a whole. In this regard, the Complainant argues that the “purpose” of the contract (here, to deliver a social media service) must be considered. \n\ne.       On the basis of all of the above, the Complainant contends that clicking accept on Facebook’s Terms of Service was an attempt by Facebook to seek consent under the GDPR - just not **valid** consent. The Complainant describes this as “forced consent”, in that the only choice a user had in April 2018 was to delete their Facebook account, and “hidden consent”, in that some of the description of the Facebook service in the Terms of Service (such as personalisation) implicitly relies on processing of personal data. \n\nf.        The Complainant contends that Facebook leads data subjects to believe that it relies on consent as lawful basis for personal data processing and/or is not transparent about its lawful bases for processing personal data. \n\n3.38.         On the counter side to this, Facebook argues that it forms a contract with its users for the use of its free service. The Commission observes that this is delivered in the form of a “Click Wrap” agreement that the user signs up to when clicking “Accept” on the Terms of Service and it looks similar to an industry standard format for such agreements. Its intention was, Facebook says, to rely on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (necessary for the performance of a contract) for processing carried out on foot of the acceptance of the Terms of Service (and, for other separate processing, it would rely on legitimate interest and consent).\n\n3.39.         In this regard, it claims that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract with the user and that the Data Policy further sets out, in more detail, the other legal bases that would be relied upon for other data processing operations. These bases, as I have said, included a reliance on consent for certain operations (such as facial recognition, where special category data is processed). Facebook rejects the idea that it sought to persuade users that consent was the legal basis for all personal data processing. It further accordingly rejected the Investigator’s analysis of whether valid consent was collected at the point of acceptance of the Terms of Service, on the basis that Facebook never sought to rely on consent.\n\n3.40.         The Investigator, for his part, took the Complaint at face value and on its literal terms and analyses each of the arguments made by the Complainant in the original Complaint submitted. This seemed to me, when preparing the Draft Decision, to have been a sensible and correct approach. This was not an “own volition” Inquiry where the Commission was entitled to scope matters of risk which it decided warranted investigation. While it is normally the role of the Investigator to focus on the establishment of facts, to set out what elements of the GDPR are engaged against those facts, to come to a preliminary view on whether there are likely infringements identified which will then be the subject of further legal analysis and ultimately decision-making by the Commission, this case is somewhat different. \n\n3.41.         By reference to the above approach, the facts to be established are fairly limited and are largely relating to the wording of Facebook’s Terms of Service and its Data Policy, and the design of its User Engagement Flow introduced in April 2018 to guide users through the process of accepting the updated Terms of Service. In fact, it appears to me that the Investigator ended up devoting time responding to legal and theoretical assertions of the Complainant, such as the argument that consent is a _lex specialis_ and therefore the mandatory legal basis where a contract primarily concerns personal data processing. Consequently, the Final Report contains more legal analysis and argument than might otherwise have been the case (relative to a draft decision). I have considered all of the analysis of the Investigator carefully and, in some instances, I adopt it and concur with it. In other instances I reject it, replace it, and explain why.\n\n3.42.         Another feature of the Complaint is a section entitled “_Applications_”. In this section, the Complainant requests an investigation of a very specific nature, and sets out the corrective powers that the Complainant believes should be imposed i.e. an administrative fine and a prohibition on the “relevant processing operations”. This section asks the Commission to:\n\n“_fully investigate this complaint, by especially using its powers under Article 58(1)(a), (e) and (f) of the GDPR, to particularly determine the following facts:_\n\n_(i.)_     _which processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the personal data of the data subject,_\n\n_(ii.)_   _for which purpose they are performed,_\n\n_(iii.)_  _on which legal basis for each specific processing operation the controller relies on and_\n\n_(iv.)_  _he/she additionally requests that a copy of any records of processing activities (Article 30 of the GDPR) are acquired._”\n\n3.43.         The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority is governed by Article 77 GDPR. Article 77(1) states how a complaint may be made: “_every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority_…_if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation_” [emphasis added]. Neither the request above, nor a request to impose specified corrective powers, can be considered to constitute part of a complaint made in accordance with Article 77(1) GDPR. The Complainant does not specify any processing operations or any alleged infringements of the GDPR in the above request, but simply asks the Commission to gather information on its behalf. Neither the GDPR nor the 2018 Act confer a particular right on a Complainant to make such a request, nor to specify what corrective powers should be imposed in circumstances where the supervisory authority is of the view that an infringement has occurred/is occurring. The Complainant, as I have already set out, also argues the right to demand such “applications” is part of Austrian procedural law. I have already set out in detail why I do not accept that Austrian procedural law is applicable to the exercise of my functions.\n\n3.44.         In those circumstances, it was for the Investigator, and ultimately for me as decision-maker, to carry out an objective reading of the Complaint. In so doing, I must consider not only the content of the Complaint, but also the legal framework by which the Commission is bound. It is also necessary that an inquiry conducted on foot of a complaint must be feasible and workable. According to Article 77(1) GDPR, a complaint should relate to data processing that, in a complainant’s view, infringes the GDPR. There is a lack of reasonable specificity in the above request in relation to processing operations or alleged infringements.\n\n3.45.         Any request to investigate all processing, or hypothetical processing, particularly a request of such an indefinite nature, does not, in my view, conform to the requirements of Article 77 GDPR. Such a request does not specify any data processing or any alleged infringement, and would result in a practically unworkable inquiry. Rather than being a complaint about specific processing operations, the Complaint in this matter has, at times, strayed into the territory of instructing the Commission to conduct an open-ended inquiry, and to direct that inquiry and the Commission’s resources in a manner determined by the Complainant. It is instead for the Commission to decide on the manner in which a reasonably specific Complaint is to be investigated.\n\n3.46.         Moving to Facebook’s views on the scope of the Complaint, when the scope set out above was put to Facebook in the Preliminary Draft Decision, it argued that \n\n“[i]_f the Complaint had intended to raise concerns about Facebook Ireland's compliance with Articles 5, 12 and 13 GDPR, it would not have said_ “the scope of this complaint is explicitly limited to any processing operations that are wholly or partly based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR.”[[302]](#_ftn302)\n\n3.47.         Facebook’s position is therefore that the issues of transparency fall outside the scope of the Complaint and by extension this Inquiry, and requested that the Commission reconsider the scope as set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision.[[303]](#_ftn303) In its submissions, Facebook simply stated that it did not accept that there was, as has been found by the Commission, an “_inherent allegation in this Complaint that the legal basis relied on by Facebook for processing personal data in accordance with the acceptance of the Terms of Service is unclear_”.[[304]](#_ftn304) Facebook has not provided more detailed submissions on this issue.\n\n3.48.         The Complaint, as Facebook correctly points out, concerns what the Complainant refers to as “forced consent”.[[305]](#_ftn305)  In making this Complaint, it is argued that there has been an attempt to mislead on Facebook’s part. Indeed, the Complaint rests on the allegation that Facebook attempted to mislead the Complainant and users generally by informing them that they were required to consent to certain processing in order to remain a Facebook user. Following submissions from Facebook to the effect that it was not relying on consent but instead the performance of the contract as a legal basis, the Complainant went on to argue that the agreement had the appearance of consent, and that this in itself was misleading. The Complainant has repeated this argument in the submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision.[[306]](#_ftn306)\n\n3.49.         The Complainant also argues that the Terms of Service themselves are vague, and that this has some bearing on either the nature of the agreement or on how to determine with any precision what processing operations are necessary in order to perform that contract. The Complainant has referred to a lack of an awareness, based on the information provided, of precisely what data is actually processed. These concerns go to the very heart of the principles of transparency and accountability in the GDPR. While the Complaint stated that it is “_limited to any processing operations that are wholly or partly based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR_”, this does not exclude the transparency of those processing operations. The processing operations being considered remain the same even where the transparency of the information provided on those processing operations is had regard to. \n\n3.50.         The Complaint has a clear focus on an alleged lack of transparency on Facebook’s part.  Having considered the submissions of both the Complainant and Facebook on this issue, I concluded that the Complaint does indeed raise issues of transparency.  As I have set out in paragraph 3.1, the conclusions on scope reflected in this Schedule 1 must read in conjunction with both Section 2 of\n\nthis Decision as well as the corresponding assessment and determination of the scope of the Complaint made by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, as summarised at paragraph 2.23 of this Decision.\n\n               \n\n**SCHEDULE** **2**\n\n  \n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) Binding Decision 3/2022 on the dispute submitted by the Irish SA on Meta Platforms Ireland Limited and its Facebook service (Art. 65 GDPR), adopted on 5 December 2022\n\n[[2]](#_ftnref2) For completeness, it should be noted that Facebook disputes the claim that the Data Policy is part of the Terms of Service.\n\n[[3]](#_ftnref3) Facebook Submissions on Draft Report, paragraph 7.1(A) 4 Complaint, page 3.  \n\n[[4]](#_ftnref4) _Ibid._\n\n[[5]](#_ftnref5) For completeness, it should be noted that the legal bases for processing of personal data include consent of the data subject, necessity based on the requirement to fulfil a contract with the data subject or processing based on the legitimate interests of the data controller.

Having regard to the decision making process within the cooperation mechanism, CSAs likewise need to be in the position to decide on possibly taking actions (e.g. agree to the decision, provide their views on the subject matter)”)_.

INTRODUCTION  \n \n1.\tThis document is a Decision (“the Decision”) of the Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) made in accordance with Section 113 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”), arising from an inquiry conducted by the Commission, pursuant to Section 110 of the 2018 Act (“the Inquiry”).   \n \n2.\tThe Inquiry concerned a complaint made to the Belgian Data Protection Authority: L'Autorité de protection des données (the “Belgian DPA“) on 25 May 2018 in respect of the Instagram service (the “Complaint”).  As the Instagram service is provided in connection with Meta Platforms, formerly the Facebook Group, the Complaint was made in respect of Facebook Ireland Limited (“Facebook”).  Following the completion of the inquiry stage, Facebook passed a special resolution to change the company name to “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited” (“Meta Ireland”), effective from 22 December 2021.  Insofar as there are any references to “Facebook” in this Decision, these should be construed to refer to “Meta Ireland”. \n \n3.\tThe Inquiry, which commenced on 20 August 2018, examined whether Meta Ireland, in the context of the Instagram service, complied with its obligations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council) (“the GDPR”) in respect of the subject matter of a Complaint.  For completeness, the Complaint was made by the non-profit organisation “noyb – European Center for Digital Rights” (the “Complainant”) on behalf of T. S. A. (“the Data Subject” or “Named Data Subject”).  The Complaint was referred to the Commission by the Belgian Data Protection Authority: L'Autorité de protection des données (“The Belgian DPA“) on 31 May 2018.  In advance of the finalisation of this Decision, a preliminary version of this document (the \"Preliminary Draft“) was circulated to Meta Ireland and the Complainant to enable them to make submissions on my findings.  I have taken account of any such submissions in finalising this document. \n \n4.\tThis Decision further reflects the binding decision that was made by the European Data Protection Board (the “Board” or, otherwise, the “EDPB”) pursuant to Article 65(2) of the GDPR,5 (the “Article 65 Decision”) which directed changes to certain of the positions reflected in the draft decision that was presented by the Commission for the purposes of Article 60 (the “Draft Decision”), as detailed further below.  The Article 65 Decision will be published on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 65(5) of the GDPR, and a copy of same is attached to this Decision. \n \n5.\tFurther details of procedural matters pertaining to the Inquiry are set out in Schedule 1 to this Decision. \n \n2. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND THE COMPLAINT \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n6.\tInstagram is a global online social network service (the “Instagram Service”) which allows registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video calls and video chats, and by sending images and video files.  It is made available to registered users without payment.  The Instagram service was launched in 2010 and was acquired by Meta Platforms, Inc., then Facebook, Inc., in 2012; it is now wholly owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.  The Instagram service can be accessed using a standalone mobile phone application, but can also be viewed as a webpage using a web-browser.  \n \n7.\tTo use the Instagram service, a prospective user must create an Instagram account.  To create an Instagram account, a prospective user is required to provide certain information (e.g. name, email address etc.) and must accept a series of terms and conditions referred to as the Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”).  When a prospective user accepts the Terms of Use, the terms contained therein constitute a contract between the (new) user and Meta Ireland in respect of the Instagram service.  It is only on acceptance of the Terms of Use that the individual becomes a registered Instagram user.  An unregistered user – i.e. a user who has not created an Instagram account and accepted the Terms of Use – has limited access to the Instagram service; while they can view certain content on the webpage version of an Instagram user’s profile page, they cannot access the mobile phone Instagram application as it is restricted to registered users. \n \n8.\tIn April 2018, Meta Platforms updated the Terms of Use and related Instagram policies to give effect to changes it sought to implement to comply with the obligations which would arise when the GDPR became applicable from 25 May 2018.  Obligations introduced by the GDPR include, inter alia, a requirement for controllers to provide detailed information to users about the purposes and the legal bases of any processing of personal data.  To continue to have full access to the Instagram service, all registered users were required to accept the updated Terms of Use prior to 25 May 2018.  The “How We Will Handle Disputes” section of the Terms of Use stated:  \n \n“If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (‘claim’), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member State that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved in a competent court in the Republic of Ireland and that Irish law will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions”. \n \n9.\tIn May 2018, the updated Terms of Use were brought to the attention of existing Instagram users by way of a series of information notices and options on the Instagram service, referred to as an “engagement flow” or “user flow” (for clarity, this Decision will refer to either term as the “user engagement flow”). The user engagement flow was designed to guide users through the process of accepting the updated Terms of Use.  It presented existing users with two separate information pages entitled “Review and Agree”.   The first such information page, containing the subheading “Changes to How We Manage Data” includes a hyperlink to the full text of the Data Policy.   The purpose of the Data Policy was to outline the information Meta Platforms – and possibly other entities in the Meta Platforms Group – processes in the context of the delivery of the Instagram service.    \n \n  \nFigure 1: “Changes to How We Manage Data” Page \n \n10.\tOn pressing the “next” button on the “Changes to How We Manage Data” page, the user was brought to the second “Review and Accept” information page.  This page required existing users \nto confirm whether he/she were over the age of 18.  It also provided a high-level overview of the changes to the Terms of Use and included a hyperlink to the full text of the updated Terms of Use.  Existing users were then presented with a binary choice: either “Agree to Terms” or “see other options”.  The visual presentation of the options differed; to select the former, the user was required to press a blue button stating “Agree to Terms” whereas the latter required the user to select the hyperlinked text “see other options” below the “Agree to Terms” button.  According to the Complaint, the only option available to a user who selected “see other options” was the deletion of his/her Instagram account.   Moreover, the updated Terms of Use stated that a user who continues to use Instagram service will be bound by the new terms.  It further stated that a user who does not wish to be bound by the updated terms could delete his/her account.   \n \n  \nFigure 2: Review and Agree Page \n \n \n \nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT \n \n11. The Complaint was made in the context of Instagram’s updated Data Policy and Terms of Use.  In particular, the Complaint concerned the requirement for existing (registered) users to accept the updated terms and policies as so to continue to use the Instagram service.  In this context, the Complaint concerns whether there is a legal basis for the processing of personal data of registered users in the context of the Instagram service.  In this vein, the Complaint relates to the processing of both (i) personal data and (ii) special category data.   The Complaint is also concerned with whether the transparency obligations in the GDPR have been complied with.   For clarity, I will summarise each aspect of the Complaint in turn. \n \nLegal Basis of Processing  \n \n12.\tIn respect of the legal basis of the processing of personal data, the Complainant alleged that all processing operations referred to in the Data Policy and Terms of Use must be assumed to be based on consent due to the requirement that existing users must accept the updated terms and policies to continue to use the Instagram service.   The Complainant further alleged that existing users were given a binary choice: (1) either accept the Terms of Use and the associated Data Policy by selecting the “Agree to Terms” button or (2) delete his/her Instagram account.   Indeed, the Complainant considered it to be, “clear that consenting to the privacy policy and terms above is the only way the data subject can maintain access to his account and therefore be able to use the said services”.  \n \n13.\tThe Complaint also highlighted processing operations which, in the view of the Complainant, are explicitly based on consent.   According to the Complainant, these include: \n \n•\t“processing data with special protections (such as your religious views, political views, who you are “interested in,” or your health, if you share this information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events), so we can share with those you choose and personalise your content”; \n•\t“using data that advertisers and other partners provide us about your activity off of Facebook Company Products, so we can personalise ads we show you on Facebook Company Products, and on websites, apps, and devices that use our advertising services”; and \n•\t“collecting information you allow us to receive through the device-based settings you enable (such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos), so we can provide the features and services described when you enable the settings”.  \n \n14.\tThe Complainant has also submitted that consent to certain processing operation is “hidden” and “seems to pretend that these processing operations would then fall under Article 6(1)(b) of GDRP [sic]”.   In essence, the Complainant alleged that the controller had misled data subjects into believing that certain processing (the Complaint referred to personalised advertising) was a contractual obligation.  Accordingly, the Complainant submitted that non-core elements of the Terms of Use must be interpreted as a form of consent.  \n \n15.\tFollowing this, the Complaint outlined the Complainant’s submissions as to why consent cannot amount to a valid legal basis for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR in the context of the processing at issue.  In this regard, the Complaint addressed each component of consent, as understood in the context of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, in turn. \n \n16.\tFirst, the Complainant submitted that the act of consent was not “freely given” as required by Article 4(11) and 7(4) GDPR as users were not “offered a genuine and realistic choice to accept or decline the terms of a service or to decline these terms without detriment”.   The Complainant alleged that the act of consent was not freely given in this context for the following reasons: \n \ni.\tThere was a “clear imbalance of power” between Meta Ireland (via the Instagram service), as the controller, and data subjects, as Instagram occupies dominant market position in “photo sharing services”.  In turn, this has given rise to a “network effect”, i.e. that the service is “a closed and proprietary network, the data subject is factually forced to join or maintain a profile with the controller”.  In the Complainant’s view, this was further supported by the “lock-in effect” of the Instagram service which occurs where “data subject uses the services of the controller for years and has invested substantial time and effort to build a profile on the service … [and] would lose access to personal information, connections and a very important network for the social, personal and professional life”.   \n \nii.\tContinued access to Instagram is conditional on the data subject’s consent which cannot be considered to be freely given in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 7(4) and Recital 43 GDPR.    \n \niii.\tThe consent provided lacked specificity as it is “bundled” with both the Terms of Use and the Data Policy and thus there is an “all or nothing approach”.  \n \niv.\tData subjects who refused to provide consent in this context suffer detriment as the “controller has threatened to … discontinue the contract with anyone that does not agree to the new privacy policy and delete the existing account”.  In this regard, the Complainant further alleged that a data subject may suffer a “secondary disadvantage” in the form of the “los[s of] a crucial form of social interaction among his peers”.  \n \n17.\tIn the alternative, the Complainant also argued that the consent was not sufficiently informed and thus could not be valid.  According to the Complaint, “[e]ven if a trained lawyer reads all the text that the controller provides, he/she can only guess what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis”.   In this vein, the Complainant further asserted that the consent is not specific as it could relate to any of the processing operation detailed in the Data Policy.   Moreover, the Complainant submitted that consent was not distinguishable from irrelevant material in the Terms of Use and the Data Policy.   The Complainant also noted that the controller could not rely on previous acts of consent in accordance with Recital 177 GDPR.  \n \nTransparency \n \n18.\tNotwithstanding the Complainant’s submission that processing must be assumed to be based on consent, the Complainant alleged that it was unclear which legal basis (if any) applied in respect of each processing operation as the “controller simply lists all six bases for lawful processing under Article 6 of the GDPR in its privacy policy without stating exactly which legal basis the controller relies upon for each specific processing operation”.24  In this regard, it appears that the Complainant’s argument rested on the premise that the legal basis for every individual processing operation must be identified and communicated to the data subjects with specificity. \n \n19.\tThe Complaint also addressed whether the information provided to data subjects satisfies the transparency requirements of the GDPR.  In this regard, the Complainant asserted that the lack of clarity as to “what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis” is contrary to the transparency and fairness requirements set out in Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c) GDPR.   The Complainant further alleged that “[a]sking for consent for a processing operation, when the controller relies in fact on another legal basis is fundamentally unfair, misleading and non-transparent within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR”.26 \n \n20.\tIn essence, this aspect of the Complaint concerns the transparency requirements set out in the GDPR, which require controllers to provide detailed information to users at the time when personal data are obtained, including the provision of information about the purposes of the processing as well as the legal bases for the processing. \n \nCorrective Powers \n \n21. Finally, I also note that the Complaint outlined several corrective measures which the Complainant sought to impose in this context.  In this regard, the Complainant requested that the matter is “fully investigated” and the results made available to it.  The Complainant further requested an order prohibiting the relevant processing operations and the imposition of effective, proportionate and dissuasive fines.   At this juncture, I note that the Complainant may not compel the Commission, or indeed any other supervisory authority, to carry out certain actions or impose particular corrective powers.  Indeed, in this regard, I note that Article 52 GDPR stipulates that each supervisory authority must act with “complete independence” in discharging its functions under the GDPR.  Therefore, while I take account of the parties’ submissions, I am not compelled to act or impose certain corrective powers by virtue of any such submissions. \n \nSCOPE OF THE COMPLAINT \n \n22.\tI have carried out my assessment of the scope of the Complaint to the extent that it relates to specified data processing and specified alleged infringements as outlined in paragraphs 123 – 150 of Schedule 1.  A chronology of issues that arose (1) as between the parties and (2) as between the parties and the Commission in the course of establishing the substantive scope of the complaint is also included in Schedule 1.  Also included in Schedule 1 are details of the approach I have adopted in concluding those issues raised.  In determining the precise parameters of the scope of the Complaint, I have had regard to the Complaint as a whole and, in particular, I have taken note of the express statements in the Complaint which seek to define its scope.  I have also had regard to the Investigator’s analysis in respect of the scope of the Complaint. \n \n23.\tOn his assessment of the Complaint, the Investigator concluded that there were four key issues to be analysed in the context of the Inquiry.   The issues, as identified by the Investigator, are as follows: \n \na.\tWhether the Named Data Subject’s acceptance of the Instagram Terms of Use and/or Data Policy was to be construed as the provision of consent within the meaning of Articles 4(11) and 6(1)(a) GDPR to the processing of personal data described in those documents – the Investigator’s views 1 and 2 of the Final Report address this issue. \n \nb.\tWhether Meta Ireland, as the controller, could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for the processing of personal data in respect of the Instagram Terms of Use – the Investigator’s view 3 of the Final Report addresses this issue. \n \nc.\tWhether Meta Ireland misrepresented the legal basis for processing personal data in such a manner that would lead the data subject to believe that any such processing is based on consent – the Investigator’s view 4 of the Final Report addresses this issue. \n \nd.\tWhether Meta Ireland failed to provide the requisite information in respect of its legal basis for processing of personal data in connection with the Terms of Use and/or Data Policy and thus did not comply with its transparency obligations in this regard – the Investigator’s views 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Final Report address this issue. \n \n24.\tI agree with the Investigator’s summary of the core issues in respect of issues (a) and (b).  However, I take a different view in treating issues (c) and (d) as raising distinct legal issues. \n \n25.\tIssue (c), as identified by the Investigator, solely addresses the allegation that Meta Ireland has misrepresented the lawful basis it relies on for processing personal data in connection with the Instagram service, such that it has misled the data subject to believe that any such processing is based on consent.  By contrast, the Investigator considered issue (d) to be a broader assessment of whether the Instagram Terms of Use and/or Data Policy complies with the transparency requirements as set out in Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of processing carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.   \n \n26.\tI am not convinced that there is a legal distinction between these issues.  Rather, it is my view that both issues are components of the same question of whether Meta Ireland has complied with its transparency requirements in respect of processing carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b).  More specifically, it is my view that where a controller has not complied with its transparency requirements, it logically follows that a data subject may be misled, deliberately or otherwise, as to legal basis of any processing in this context.  By contrast, where the controller has provided sufficient information to data subjects such that the transparency requirements have been complied with, it cannot be the case that the data subject has been misled as to the legal basis.  The factual question of whether the data subject was misled as to the legal basis is therefore part of the broader question as to whether there was compliance with transparency requirements and should not be considered in isolation of this broader issue. \n \n27.\tIn its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland disagreed with my view that issues (b), (c) and (d) fell within the scope of the Complaint.   In particular, Meta Ireland submitted that: \n \n“an investigation into a specific complaint should abide by the parameters of that complaint, which here is focused on “forced consent” only, in order to respect the integrity of the mandate provisions under Article 80 GDPR. Where an investigation is said to be into allegations raised by a specific complaint, a supervisory authority should confine its investigation accordingly”.  \n \n28.\tI agree with Meta Ireland to some extent that the Complaint primarily outlined concerns as to “forced consent”, however, I am of the view that the Complaint was not solely limited to consent.  Rather, as I have outlined above, the Complaint concerned the legal basis of the processing  and, where Meta Ireland has not sought to rely on consent as the legal basis, it follows that the Commission is entitled to investigate and consider the legal basis which Meta Ireland has in fact sought to rely on.  In terms of the transparency of the information provided, I would emphasise that the Complaint explicitly alleges that the information provided on the legal bases (in the Privacy Policy) is such that data subjects “can only guess what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis. This is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c)”.   This clearly concerns the transparency of the information provided and, accordingly, I am of the view that it falls within the scope of the Complaint. \n \n29.\tIn its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant alleged that the scope of the Complaint as identified in the Preliminary Draft did “not adequately deal with the issues” raised by the Complainant and, indeed, did “not even come close” to doing so.   As set out in both this Decision and the attached Schedule 1, the Complaint is clearly limited to the lawfulness of processing carried out on foot of the “agreement”, i.e. acceptance of the (Meta Ireland) Terms of Service and/or Instagram Terms of Use.  I therefore do not accept that the matters addressed in the Preliminary Draft did not cover all aspects of the Complaint. \n \n30.\tI also note that the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft also alleged that there had been a failure by the Commission to fully investigate the relevant facts, in particular in respect of whether the “agreement” entered into by the individual data subject and Meta Ireland was for “a consent” or “a contract”.   I considered this matter in depth in the Preliminary Draft.  In this respect, I also note the Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft call for the Commission to engage in a thorough investigation as to the nature of this agreement, having regard to the scope of the Complaint, this is, in my view, entirely unnecessary and would not divulge any new information or serve a useful purpose at this stage.  As is set out in Section 3 below, there is no dispute in relation to the fact that there is a contract between Meta Ireland and the Complainant or the fact no consent within the meaning of the GDPR has been provided by the Complainant in concluding the “agreement” in dispute. What is in dispute, as set out in detail in this Decision and in Schedule 1, is the lawfulness of the personal data processing and the transparency of the information provided.  \n \n31.\tFollowing the circulation of the Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR the supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands raised objections in relation to the Commission’s assessment of the scope of the Complaint, as summarised above. \n \n32.\tThe EDPB determined, at paragraph 202 of the Article 65 Decision, that the inquiry underpinning this Decision ought to have included an examination of “[Meta Ireland’s] processing operations, the categories of data processed (including to identify special categories of personal data that may be processed), and the purposes they serve”.  Accordingly, the EDPB directed, at paragraph 203 of the Article 65 Decision, the Commission to commence a new inquiry into these matters.  While that direction cannot be addressed by the Commission in this Decision, the Commission considers it necessary to note the position, in light of the Commission’s assessment of the scope of the Complaint (as already recorded above) and for the purpose of ensuring compliance with its obligation, pursuant to Article 65(6) GDPR, to adopt its final decision on the basis of the Article 65 Decision.  The EDPB further directed the Commission to remove its proposed conclusion on Finding 1 (as set out in the Draft Decision).  That aspect of matters is addressed at the conclusion of the Commission’s assessment of Issue 1, below. \n \n33.\tOn the basis of the above, the issues that will be addressed in the Decision are as follows: \n \n•\tIssue 1 – Whether clicking on the “Agree to Terms” button constitutes or must be considered consent for the purposes of the GDPR and, if so, whether it is valid consent for the purposes of the GDPR. \n•\tIssue 2 – Whether Meta Ireland could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for processing of personal data in the context of the Terms of Use and/or Data Policy. \n•\tIssue 3 – Whether Meta Ireland provided the requisite information on the legal basis for processing on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and whether it did so in a transparent manner. \n \n3. ISSUE 1 – WHETHER CLICKING ON THE “AGREE TO TERMS” BUTTON CONSTITUTES OR MUST BE CONSENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GDPR \nIntroduction \n \n33.\tAs a preliminary issue, I note that Article 6(1)(a) GDPR provides that consent may be a lawful basis for the processing of personal data.  While the legal basis of data processing in the context of the Instagram service is within the scope of the Complaint (see, Issue 2 below), this first issue is limited to the narrow assessment of whether the act of clicking the “Agree to Terms” button amounts to – or must amount to – consent for the purposes of the GDPR.   \n \n34.\tTherefore, in this section of the Decision, I will focus on consent and will assess two interrelated considerations: first, whether clicking the “Agree to Terms” button actually constitutes consent for the purposes of the GDPR and, second, whether the act of clicking “Agree to Terms” necessarily must be considered consent for such purposes.  In this respect, I note that Meta Ireland’s position is that it did not seek to obtain the Data Subject’s consent via acceptance of the Terms of Use for processing in connection with the Terms of Use.  \n \nRelevant Provisions \n \n35.\tAs noted above, Article 6(1) GDPR enumerates the lawful bases for processing personal data and states:   \n \n“Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n \n(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes”. \n \n36.\tConsent is defined in Article 4(11) GDPR as: \n \n“any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her”. \n \n37.\tInterpretative guidance is found in Recital 32 GDPR which states that consent is an act which establishes a “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement”.  Recital 32 GDPR recognises that the act of consent may take several forms – for example, ticking an unchecked box, selecting certain settings or a statement or conduct which “clearly indicates” the data subject’s agreement – but does not extend to “[s]ilence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity”. \n \n38.\tThe conditions for valid consent are set out in Article 7 GDPR as follows: \n \n“1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. \n \n2.\tIf the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. \n \n3.\tThe data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. \n \n4.\tWhen assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.” \n \nWhether Clicking “Agree to Terms” Constitutes Consent for the Purposes of the GDPR \n \n39.\tAs outlined above, the Complaint submitted that  \n \n“the controller required the data subject to “agree” to the entire privacy policy and the terms [which] … leads to our preliminary assumption, that all processing operations described therein are based on consent, or that the controller at least lead the data subject to belief that all these processing operations are (also) based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or 9(2)(a) of the GDPR”.    \n \n40.\tThe Complaint also alleged that the consent was “forced” and misled data subjects – including the Named Data Subject – into believing that the processing was required as a contractual obligation.   In this regard, the Complainant premised its position on the assertion that Meta Ireland has relied on a “deceptive design” in respect of the user engagement flow.   As the Complainant’s submissions in respect of “misleading data subjects” concern the transparency of the information provided to data subjects, this will be further considered in the context of Issue 3.  \n \n41.\tMeta Ireland’s position is that not all processing in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use is based on consent.39  In relation to whether the act of clicking on the “Agree to Terms” button constitutes consent, Meta Ireland submitted that agreeing to the Instagram Terms of Use amounts to a contractual agreement and is not an act of consent for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.   \nMeta Ireland further asserted that it “does not in any way seek to ‘infer’ consent from a user to process personal data based on their agreement to the Terms of Use” and that there is a strict distinction between accepting the Terms of Use and obtaining consent for the purposes of the GDPR.   Moreover, Meta Ireland stated that the “Terms of Use user flow was designed to enable the user to accept the Terms of Use and enter into a contract with Facebook Ireland [now Meta Ireland]” and not as a mechanism for obtaining user consent.   For completeness, I acknowledge that Meta Ireland provided information as to the sets of processing operations for which consent is sought in the context of the Instagram service.  \n \n42.\tAs regards the individual act of clicking the “Agree to Terms” button, the Investigator stated that he was \n \n“not satisfied that this form of acceptance of the Data Policy constituted the data subject’s consent to processing within the meaning of the GDPR, because such an agreement does not objectively accord with the specific conditions for data protection consent as prescribed in Article 4(11) GDPR. In particular, this type of acceptance would not be regarded as freely given or unambiguous consent pursuant to Article 4(11) GDPR in circumstances where the Data Policy describes many different types of processing, performed for separate purposes.”.   \n \n43.\tIn setting out the above to the Parties in the Preliminary Draft, I took the view that Meta Ireland did not seek to rely on consent in requiring users to select the “Agree to Terms” button in the user engagement flow but rather that this related to the acceptance of the Terms of Use.  In response to this, in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft dated 4 February 2022, Meta Ireland reaffirmed its position that “it has not sought consent to the processing of personal data described in the Data Policy by asking users to agree to the Terms of Use” as the latter is an “entirely distinct document” from the former.    \n \n44.\tOn the contrary, it is the Complainant’s position, as expressed in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, that “Facebook never openly ‘sought to rely on consent’”.   In particular, the Complainant sought to rely on the principle of falsa demonstratio, i.e. that the agreement between the Named Data Subject and Meta Ireland must be interpreted by reference to what “truly intended to be, not at what it is labeled as”.   In this regard, the Complainant sought to rely on the intention of the parties, the “economic background and the common understanding of the agreement” and the fact that Meta Ireland had only recently changed the provisions to support this position. \n \n45.\tWhile the Complainant’s submissions may have some relevance to the issue of reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the lawful basis for the processing (considered in Issue 2 below), it does not appear to me that this addresses the issues underpinning reliance on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.  Indeed, I am satisfied that, in requiring registered users to select the “Agree to Terms” button in the user engagement flow, Meta Ireland was not considering this act to amount to an act of consent.   The user engagement flow relates to acceptance of the Terms of Use.  I note in this regard that the Terms of Use refer to (and indeed contains a link to) the Instagram Data Policy, stating that the document “explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy and Security Settings”.   It is clear from the text of the Data Policy that Meta Ireland does not intend to rely on consent for all data processing in the context of the Instagram service.   It further appears that the Parties are in agreement that acceptance of the Terms of Use was not valid consent for the purposes of the GDPR. \n \n46.\tFor the reasons outlined above, I proposed to conclude that, as a matter of fact, Meta Ireland did not – and did not seek – to rely on consent as the legal basis for all processing in connection with the Terms of Use and was  satisfied that Meta Ireland considered that selecting the “Agree to Terms” button represented acceptance of the Terms of Use.   \n \n \nAs noted already above, however, the EDPB instructed the Commission (by way of paragraph 203 of the Article 65 Decision) to remove, from its Draft Decision, “its conclusion on Finding 1”.  Finding 1 included proposed conclusions on two linked questions, namely: (i) whether Meta Ireland sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Service; and (ii) whether Meta Ireland was legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so.  Given that my previously proposed conclusion (as noted immediately above) in relation to the first of these questions is encompassed by the EDPB’s instruction, I make no finding on this first question. \n \n \nWhether Meta Ireland must rely on Consent \n \n47.\tIn the course of the Inquiry, the Complainant advanced, what appears to me to be, an additional and alternative argument in respect of consent.  In essence, the Complainant alleged that processing in connection with the Instagram Terms of Use must be based on consent.  In other words, the Complainant asserted that Article 6(1)(a) – consent of the data subject – could, as a matter of law, be the only legal basis applicable to processing of personal data in connection with the Instagram service.  It further appears to me that the Complainant also alleged that, as Meta Ireland did not rely on consent as the lawful basis for such processing, the processing was therefore to be considered unlawful. \n \n48.\tIn this regard, in its submissions dated 19 August 2020, the Complainant sought to draw a distinction between contracts on the basis of their subject matter; i.e. between contracts which are “primarily data processing” and contracts which concern “primarily some other contractual service”.    In drawing this distinction, the Complainant suggested that Article 6(1)(a) GDPR is the appropriate legal basis for the former category of contracts (i.e. those which primarily concern data processing) whereas Article 6(1)(b) may be appropriate in respect of latter.  The effect of this position would be that consent would be required to be the default legal basis for agreements which (primarily) concern data processing activities.  I also note that the Complainant asserted that Article 6(1)(a) was lex specialis as compared to any other legal basis in Article 6 GDPR and sought to draw a distinction between the “definition of consent” and the “legal conditions for validity”.   If accepted, this approach would imply that there may be a hierarchy of legal bases.  \n \n49.\tThe Complainant further stated that it would be “utterly absurd” if consent requirements were circumvented by controllers presenting “declarations” as “data processing contracts” (such as, the Terms of Use in this context).   In this regard, the Complainant added that there should be a “systemic interpretation” to create a distinction between Articles 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) on the basis that “[a]llowing the controllers free reign on choosing which legal basis is the most appropriate for them would go against the intention of the EU legislator and would definitely undermine the protection of data subjects”.   The Complainant further argued that, as the modified parts of the Terms of Use solely concerned data protection issues, those modifications could not constitute contractual terms.   In this regard, I emphasise that the Commission does not have competence to consider whether a particular term is valid as a matter of domestic contract law. \n \n50.\tIn his consideration of this matter, the Investigator noted that the Complaint is premised on the fact that as the Named Data Subject “had to agree to” the updated Terms of Use and Data Policy in 2018, it followed that “all processing operations” referenced in Terms of Use and Data Policy must be based on consent.   It does not appear to me that the Complaint is sensitive to the distinction between the act of agreeing to a contract (even in circumstances where that contract concerns the processing of personal data) and the act of providing consent for the purpose of legitimatising the processing of personal data.  It is important to emphasise the EDPB’s view that these are entirely distinct concepts which “have different requirements and legal consequences”.   Indeed, these concepts refer to entirely different legal bases, with different components and all the consequences that that entails. \n \n51.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I emphasised that any implication that the GDPR contains a hierarchy of legal bases is, in my view, inherently problematic and contradicts the wording of the GDPR.  Indeed, it cannot be said that “one ground has normative priority over the others”, and nor does the text of the GDPR even suggest that there may be a hierarchy of legal bases.   This is the position expressed by the Article 29 Working Group, which, while not strictly speaking legally binding on the Commission, provides guidance which is illustrative.  In respect of the former Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive (i.e. Directive 95/46/EC), which as with Article 6 GDPR concerns the legal basis of processing, the Article 29 Working Group stated that “the text … does not make a legal distinction between the six grounds and does not suggest that there is a hierarchy among them”.   This also appears to be the view of the EDPB, as it has stated that the “application of one of these six bases must be established” [my emphasis].   Moreover, the CJEU, also in the context of Directive 95/46/EC, held that the obtaining of consent is not a precondition for reliance on legitimate interests as a legal basis.   The effect of this finding is that consent is not considered to be a necessary or mandatory legal basis where a controller has sought to rely on another legal basis.   \n \n52.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I noted that the Complainant also relied on Directive 93/13/EEC, i.e. the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive, to support the argument that consent takes precedence over other legal bases.    In particular, the Complainant alleged that, on the basis of Article 5 thereof, the “terms of service are to be interpreted in the interests of the consumer in the event of ambiguity”.    In this regard, I emphasise that Article 55(1) GDPR limits the competence of supervisory authorities to that conferred by the GDPR.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the GDPR implies that supervisory authorities must necessarily – or indeed are competent to - give effect to concepts provided for in other measures.    \n \n53.\tIn its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland stated that the GDPR does not contain an “automatic activation of consent as a legal basis” where there is a contractual agreement between the relevant parties.   Meta Ireland also agreed with my view that there is no hierarchy between the lawful bases under the GDPR.  In support of this position, Meta Ireland also referred to the recent statement of the European Commission that “the six legal bases for the processing of personal data under the GDPR are equally valid and protective”.   For the avoidance of doubt, I restate my position that no legal basis has primacy over any other and further note that, despite the arguments initially advanced by the Complainant, in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant agreed that there is no hierarchy of legal bases under the GDPR.  \n \n54.\tAccordingly, on the basis of the above, I am of the view that Article 6(1) GDPR – or indeed any other provision of the GDPR – does not envisage or require that certain processing based on particular circumstances must necessarily be based on consent.  \n \n55.\tWhere a contract has been entered into between a consumer and an organisation, it may be the case that the lawful basis is “necessity for the performance of a contract”, provided for in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  It cannot be said that the fact of agreeing to certain contractual terms necessarily means that any processing of personal data under such contract is based on consent for the purposes of the GDPR.  As I have stated above, there is an important distinction between the act of accepting contractual terms and providing consent to data processing, even in circumstances where the relevant contract is premised on data processing.  Reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR turns on the particular agreement entered into by the parties and where the relevant processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations are necessary for the performance of that particular agreement.  It cannot be said that the type of contract (in particular when divorced from the content of the contract) dictates the legal basis.  To this, I would add that the EDPB has advised that where the relevant processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, it is not appropriate to rely on consent as the legal basis.  \n \n56.\tRelying on the Complainant’s distinction between contracts primarily concerning data processing and contracts relating to other contractual services (which I have described above), the Complainant alleged that “the intention, purpose and the context of the Instagram Terms of Use obviously about concern data processing and not a civil law contract” and must be based on consent as they could not be considered contractual clauses.   In this respect, I am not aware of any caselaw or authority which suggests that controllers cannot rely, at least in part, on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data simply because their businesses “primarily” concern data processing.  In the absence of any such authority, I cannot read in such additional conditions and provisos to the GDPR. \n \n57.\tIn response to the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant alleged that “all other legal bases simply do not ‘fit’ the types of processing in the dispute. There is simply no contract under Article 6(1)(b) … or legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. So as a matter of logic, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR is simply the remaining option for auxiliary processing”.   This response further affirms my position, as expressed in the Preliminary Draft, that the substance of the Complainant’s argument concerns an entirely separate point, namely that Meta Ireland is not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for processing in the context of the Instagram service.  If the Complainant succeeds in that latter argument, it follows that another legal basis must be relied on and in this instance, in the Complainant’s view, that legal basis would have to be consent.  In my view, this alternative argument - to the effect that consent is the only remaining possible lawful basis because no other basis can be used lawfully for this particular agreement – is properly considered in the context of Issue 2, i.e. whether Meta Ireland is entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n \n58.\tFor completeness, I shall return to and address the Complainant’s assertion that the definition of consent must be distinguished from the condition of validity.69  Elaborating on this point, the Complainant sought to rely on Article 7(2) and (4) GDPR.  As I have outlined above, Article 7(2) GDPR states: \n \n“If the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.” \n \n59.\tArticle 7(4) GDPR states: \n \n“When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.” \n \n60.\tAt this juncture, I note that Meta Ireland’s position on this matter (as expressed in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft) is that “arguments by the Complainant on the ‘conditions for validity’ of consent are entirely irrelevant to the Inquiry because Meta Ireland does not seek to obtain consent when it obtains contractual agreement from its users to the Terms of Use”.   I further note that Meta Ireland does rely on consent for processing data provided by Meta Ireland’s “partners” (i.e. third parties) about user activity off-Instagram for the purposes of providing personalised advertising but obtains consent via a distinct user engagement flow and not via acceptance of the Terms of Use.  \n \n61.\tIn this respect, it is important to emphasise that Article 7 GDPR concerns the “conditions for consent” but is only applicable where consent is being relied on as the legal basis for processing.  This was the view of Advocate General Szpunar in Planet49.   Article 7 GDPR does not operate as a free-standing provision which indicates which lawful basis a controller must or indeed should rely on in a particular context.  Rather, the purpose of Article 7 GDPR is to assist with the determination of whether the “conditions for validity” (to borrow the Complainant’s language) have been met.   \n \n62.\tI further note that the EDPB Guidelines on Consent consider a number of circumstances in which “bundling” (or what the Complainant refers to as “forced consent”  or “hidden consent” ) may occur.   For example, this occurs when consent can neither be freely given nor easily withdrawn because the provision of consent is made part of the terms of a contract, particularly in circumstances where there is an unequal balance of power between the data controller and the data subject.76  As with Article 7 GDPR, consideration of bundling is only relevant where the controller has purported to rely on consent in the first place.  \n63.\tHaving considered the submissions of the Parties, including the submissions on the Preliminary \nDraft, in the Draft Decision, I therefore proposed to conclude that the legal basis for processing of personal data under the Terms of Use between Meta Ireland and Instagram users, including the Complainant, does not, as a matter of law, have to be consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and, as a matter of fact, Meta Ireland does not rely on consent for this purpose and the agreement to the Terms of Use does not constitute consent for the purposes of the GDPR.   \nAs noted already above, however, the EDPB instructed the Commission (by way of paragraph 203 of the Article 65 Decision) to remove, from its Draft Decision, “its conclusion on Finding 1”.  In accordance with that instruction, I make no finding on the matters encompassed by the above assessment of Issue 1. \n \n\t4 \tISSUE 2 - RELIANCE ON 6(1)(B) GDPR AS A LAWFUL BASIS FOR PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING \nIntroduction \n \n64. As outlined above, the Complainant has submitted that Meta Ireland’s processing of personal data under the Instagram Terms of Use must, as a matter of law, be based entirely on consent as a legal basis under the GDPR.    The Complainant’s argument also rests on the contention that Meta Ireland cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in order to perform the Instagram Terms of Use. \n \nRelevant Provisions \n \n65.\tPursuant to Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (the “Charter”): \n \n“1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. \n \n2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law.” \n \n66.\tFurther detail on the principles underpinning the processing of personal data is found in Article 5 GDPR; in particular, Article 5(1)(a) GDPR provides that personal data must be “processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”.  \n \n67.\tInterpretative guidance is found in Recital 39 GDPR which states that “[a]ny processing of personal data should be lawful and fair”.  Moreover, Recital 40 GDPR provides that: \n \n“In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law.”  \n \n68.\tArticle 6(1) GDPR enumerates six lawful bases for processing personal data and states:   \n \n“Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n\t \t… \n(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract…” \n69.\tIn this regard, Recital 44 GDPR states: \n“Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a contract.”  \n70.\tRecital 68 GDPR states: \n“… Furthermore, that right [the right to receive personal data] should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract.”  \n71.\tIn considering reliance on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis for processing, regard must be had, inter alia to the respective rights of the parties to a contract, as well as Article 16 of the Charter which provides for the freedom to conduct a business.  It states that “[t]he freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices is recognised.” \nAssessment of whether Meta Ireland was entitled to Rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR \n \n72. In considering this matter, in the Draft Decision, I first examined the relationship between the Terms of Use and the Data Policy.  This assessment was necessitated by the fact that the Named Data Subject has alleged that he agreed to the Data Policy by virtue of accepting the updated \nInstagram Terms of Use.   Having addressed this matter, I then, in the Draft Decision, considered the more substantive issue of whether Meta Ireland is entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the legal basis underpinning the processing of personal data in connection with the Terms of Use. \n \nRelationship between the Terms of Use and the Data Policy \n \n73.\tThe Complainant alleged that “the controller required the data subject to ‘agree’ to the entire privacy policy and the terms”;  that is, by clicking the “Agree to terms” button, the Complainant contended that the Named Data Subject agreed to both the Terms of Use and the Data Policy.  As the Investigator noted, the Complainant alleged that “that the data subject consented to processing described in the Data Policy by clicking on the ‘Next button at the end of the first information page of the Instagram user engagement flow”.   Meta Ireland’s position is that the selection of the \n“Agree to Terms” button does not mean that a data subject has agreed to the Data Policy.  \n \n74.\tThe Investigator was of the view that the Instagram Data Policy was the means by which Meta Ireland provided information on data processing to Instagram users and was not the means by which Instagram users provided consent to any such data processing.   While the Investigator noted that the user engagement flow was “ambiguous and unclear” and it “would not be unreasonable for a person reading the Data Policy information page to conclude that they had, in some sense, agreed to the Data Policy”, he nonetheless concluded that the Data Policy and Terms of Use were separate.  \n \n75.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I expressed the preliminary view that the acceptance in question was not an act of consent but, on its terms, constituted acceptance of, or agreement to, a contract i.e. the Terms of Use.  In its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland agreed with my assessment in this regard.   The Complainant’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft did not express any further views on this issue.   \n \n76.\tI see no reason to depart from my earlier view.  Although the Data Policy was hyperlinked in the course of the engagement flow (see Figure 1 above), I am not satisfied that the Data Policy was thereby incorporated into the Terms of Use.  The “Agree to Terms” button clearly referred to acceptance of the “terms” as distinct from the Data Policy (and indeed the Cookies Policy).  In this sense, I agree with Meta Ireland’s view that the Data Policy is an “information document… rather than being contractual in nature”.84  Indeed, the Data Policy is a document through which Meta Ireland seeks to comply with particular provisions of the GDPR in relation to transparency, whereas the Terms of Use is the contract between Meta Ireland and the Instagram user.  Meta Ireland relies on various legal bases for various data processing operations, some of which are based on contractual necessity.  Where the legal basis of contractual necessity is relied on, the contract in question is the Terms of Use.  In my view, the contract in question, and therefore the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR must take place, is the Terms of Use only.  The Data Policy is only relevant insofar as it sheds light on the processing operations carried out for which Meta Ireland relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n \n77.\tThe Data Policy itself references a very wide range of processing operations.  As noted in Schedule 1, the Complainant sought to direct the Commission to conduct an assessment of all processing operations carried out by Meta Ireland in the context of the Instagram service.  I have explained why it is not open to a Complainant – who must present a complaint with a reasonable degree of specificity – to demand such an assessment.  While the Complaint refers to various examples of data processing, e.g. the processing of behavioural data, it does not go so far as to directly link the Complaint to specific processing operations by reference to an identifiable body of data with any great clarity or precision.  In the circumstances, it is necessary to consider the issue relating to reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR at the level of principle, and my findings are made on that basis. \n \n78.\tMore specifically, insofar as the Complaint refers to particular processing activities, it has a specific focus on data processed to facilitate behavioural advertising.  This will accordingly be the focus of the analysis in this Decision.  In the Draft Decision, in order to ensure that it had a reasonable degree of specificity, I considered whether Meta Ireland could, in principle, rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for processing under the Instagram Terms of Use, including and in particular in the context of behavioural advertising. \n \nWhether Meta Ireland was Entitled to Rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR \n \nPositions of the Complainant, Meta Ireland and the Investigator \n \n79.\tIn considering whether Meta Ireland was in fact entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the legal basis for processing in connection with the Terms of Use, it is necessary to delineate the positions of (i) the Complainant, (ii) Meta Ireland, and (iii) the Investigator. \n \nThe Complainant \n \n80.\tIn the Complaint, the Complainant expressed concern that Meta Ireland were seeking to “to pretend that these processing operations would then fall under Article 6(1)(b) of GDRP [sic]”.   In outlining their understanding of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the Complainant relied on the following from the Opinion 06/2014 of the Article 29 Working Party: \n \n“The provision [now, Article 6(1)(b)] must be interpreted strictly and does not cover situations where the processing is not genuinely necessary for the performance of a contract, but rather unilaterally imposed on the data subject by the controller. Also the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) [now, Article 6(1)(b)] is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. … Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”.  \n \nIn subsequent submissions, the Complainant expanded upon its understanding of the concept of “necessity” in data protection law.   The Complainant alleged that “processing which is not strictly ‘necessary’ for a contract would automatically imply a violation of Article 8 in conjunction with Article 52(1) of the Charter as it would not pass the necessity test”.  \n \n81.\tIn the text of the Complaint, the Complainant further stated that Meta Ireland could only rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis for processing which concerned a “core element of a social network”.   The Complainant added that, in its view, the sections of the Terms of Use which concerned “advertisement[s], sponsored content, analysis and improvement of the controller’s products and alike” were not such “core elements” or a “relevant contractual obligation” and, accordingly, Meta Ireland could not rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.90  In subsequent submissions, the Complainant alleged that while the EDPB envisages that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR might be a lawful basis for processing which occurs for the “personalisation of content”, it could not constitute a lawful basis where the processing “is not an integral part of using the Service”.  \n \n82.\tThe Complainant expanded on its position in respect of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for processing in subsequent submissions.  In this regard, the Complainant relied on the following statement from the EDPB Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b): “’it is important to determine what the scope of the contract is and what data would be necessary for the performance of that contract’”.   The Complainant alleged that neither the Commission nor the Belgian DPA had conducted such an exercise.   The Complainant also proposed several steps that the Commission should follow in our assessment of the matter.  In particular, the Complainant alleged that the Instagram Terms of Use should be assessed by reference to Belgian contract law.  \n \n83.\tIn addition, the Complainant submitted that Meta Ireland did not identify, with specificity, the \n“specific processing operations [which] are “necessary” for specific clauses of the contract”.   Rather, it is the Complainant’s position that the Commission must first clarify which clauses in the contract between the Named Data Subject and Meta Ireland are relied on as being objectively necessary for the performance of the contract.  In the Complainant’s view:  \n \n“None of these “statements” [in the Instagram Terms of Use] can reasonably be considered an “obligation” under the applicable provisions of the Belgian Civil Code; they are neither enforceable, nor in possession of a specific subject matter that could be described as a contractual commitment”.  \n \nThe Complainant also considered the individual clauses contained in the Instagram Terms of Use to be not contractual in nature.97 \n \n84.\tI further note the Complainant’s position that processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could only be lawful where  such processing is in the interests of the data subject.  That is, the Complainant suggested that it is important to “draw a line in order to separate the processing necessary to provide the services of a social network (e.g. own page, news, photo uploads) from the processing in the sole interest of Facebook (e.g. advertising, product development)”.98 \n \nMeta Ireland \n \n85.\tIn the course of the Inquiry, Meta Ireland submitted that it does not seek to mislead the user by relying on “hidden” consent in connection with any user’s acceptance of the Terms of Use.   In any case, Meta Ireland alleged that “the Complainant has failed to articulate any meaningful argument that any of the specific processing described in the “The Instagram Service” section of the Terms of Use cannot be based on Article 6(1)(b)”.   In addition, Meta Ireland asserted that “the concept of what is necessary in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not mean that processing must be strictly essential to the performance of the contract, or the only way to perform the underlying contract”.101  In this vein, it considered that “the processing which is necessary to perform the full agreement entered into between the parties can include optional or conditional elements of contract, and this is a matter for the parties to the contract”.   Meta Ireland also did not consider that the contract must be in the interests of the data subject.  \n \nThe Investigator \n \n86.\tFirst, the Investigator did not accept the argument that the acceptance of the Terms of Use amount to “hidden” consent.   Second, the Investigator formed the view that the substance of the agreement between the parties must be examined but that the term “necessary” “does not mean that processing must be strictly essential to performance of the contract, or the only way to perform the underlying contract” but extends to processing which is necessary for the performance of the entire agreement entered into by the relevant parties.   The Investigator was not convinced that the assessment of the entire agreement implied the identification of “core functions” of the contract.   Third, the Investigator was not satisfied that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was limited to contracts which were deemed to be in the interests of the data subject.   On this basis of this analysis, the Investigator formed the view that Meta Ireland could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the lawful basis for processing in the context of the Instagram service. \n \nMy Consideration of the Issue \n \n87.\tIn considering this issue, I have had regard to the guidance of the EDPB on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (the “Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines”).   Although I emphasise that the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines are, strictly speaking, not legally binding and have considered this issue in high-level, general terms, these guidelines are nonetheless instructive as to the factors to be taken into account in addressing this issue.  I note that the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines clearly states that Article 6(1)(b) may be relied on as a legal basis for processing where “the processing in question must be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract with a data subject”.   It is evident from the drafting of Article 6(1)(b) that consideration of the meaning of the term “contract” within a data protection context is required, as the existence of a contract is a prerequisite for reliance on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis.  However, I also consider that an assessment of the meaning of the terms “necessary” and “performance” within this context is also required.  For completeness and contrary to the Complainant’s submissions on this matter in its response to the Preliminary Draft,  I note that I do not have competence to consider substantive issues of contract law,  and, accordingly, my analysis is limited to the specific contract entered into by the Named Data Subject and Meta Ireland in respect of the Instagram service.   \n \n88.\tIn considering the meaning of “performance” in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, I first note that that the precise legal definition of what constitutes performance of a contract is also a matter primarily determined by the applicable national law.  Nonetheless, the recognition by the EDPB that “processing is necessary in order that the particular contract with the data subject can be performed” is instructive.   In general terms, a contract is performed when each party to that contract discharges their contractual obligations by reference to the bargain struck between the parties.  It further seems to me that the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines implicitly endorse an assessment of performance of those contractual obligations by reference to whether “a requested service can be provided”.   That is, it appears to me that there must be a nexus between the specific processing operations and the bargain struck as part of the contract.    \n \n89.\tAn assessment of “performance” is clearly linked to the concept of “necessity” as what is necessary for the performance of a contract is anything which, if it is did not occur, would mean that the specific contract entered into would not have been performed.  The mere inclusion of a term in a contract does not necessarily mean that it is necessary for the performance of that contract; rather, a functional assessment of the specific contract should take place.  This has been recognised by the EDPB; for example, in the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines, the EDPB indicated that the fact that a contract mentions or refers to data processing does not necessarily imply that Article 6(1)(b) is engaged.   In this regard, I emphasise the EDPB’s view that “controller should be able to demonstrate how the main subject-matter of the specific contract with the data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur”.  \n \n90.\tIt is appropriate to say, at this juncture, that the consideration of what is necessary for the performance of a contract entails more than a simple assessment of what is or is not written into \nthe terms of a contract.   In the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines, the EDPB provided guidance on the interpretation of necessity within the context of data protection law.  It remains the case however that necessity cannot be considered entirely in the abstract, and careful regard must be had for what is necessary for the performance of the specific contract freely entered into by the parties.  In this regard, I note the EDPB’s view that: \n \n“Where a controller seeks to establish that the processing is based on the performance of a contract with the data subject, it is important to assess what is objectively necessary to perform the contract. ‘Necessary for performance’ clearly requires something more than a \ncontractual clause” [my emphasis].  \n \n91.\tThe Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines also set out that controller should: \n \n“demonstrate how the main object of the specific contract with the data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur. The important issue here is the nexus between the personal data and processing operations concerned, and the performance or non-performance of the service provided under the contract.”  \n \n92.\tI also note that the term “necessary” must be understood in terms of its independent meaning within EU law and also within the context and objective of data protection matters.  In this regard, I note that, in Heinz Huber v Bundesrepublik Deutschlan, the CJEU held that “necessity” has “its own independent meaning” in EU law and “must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that directive” (in that case, the relevant measure was Directive 95/46/EC, the predecessor of the GDPR).   In my view, this indicates that necessity should be interpreted by reference to the objectives of the relevant legislative measure, i.e. the GDPR in this context.   \n \n93.\tMoreover, I consider it prudent to emphasise that, in Huber, the CJEU also indicated that it may be appropriate to consider whether the chosen course of action enables the “legislation to be more effectively applied”, suggesting that “necessity” does not require the most minimal processing possible.   In this regard, I share the Investigator’s view122 that this implies that a strict necessity test is not envisaged but rather, the test includes processing beyond the most minimal to meet the objective where the processing renders a lawful objective “more effective”.   However, the EDPB proposes clear limits to this by stating that “merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b).”  \n \n94.\tThe Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines emphasise that necessity is assessed by reference to the “particular contract with the data subject”.   In this respect, the EDPB have regard to the “core” functions of the contract; this is reflective of the Complainant’s position that the core functions of the contract must be determined so as to assess whether the processing is objectively necessary to perform that contract.   In the Draft Decision, I expressed the view that it is correct to define necessity by reference to the core functions of the specific contract at issue.  I further agreed that the EDPB is correct that necessity for the purposes of Article 6(1)(b) is determined by reference to the particular and specific contract  that has been entered into by the controller (and/or processor) and data subject(s).  It follows that the approach I had taken in the Draft Decision was to assess whether the relevant processing operation(s) were necessary to fulfil the particular and specific contract entered into by the Named Data Subject and Meta Ireland (i.e. the Instagram Terms of Use). \n \n95.\tThere is an interrelationship between the concepts of “necessary”, “performance” and “contract” and, accordingly, an assessment of the core functions of a contract cannot be considered in isolation from those concepts.  That is, it would be incorrect to assess, at a general level, whether the operations are necessary to achieve the objective of a “social network” platform.  Rather, the operations must be necessary to fulfil the core agreement between Meta Ireland and the Instagram users, reflected in the terms of the precise contract between those parties.  Therefore, I must examine the contract itself and ascertain the core functions of the contract for the purpose of considering whether the processing operations are necessary to fulfil these functions.  In doing so, I reiterate my previous statement that issues concerning the validity and/or substance of the contract – as matters of national contract law - are outside the scope of the Commission.  Nonetheless, I share the EDPB’s view that, in my assessment, “regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service”.   In this sense, I am considering the bargain that was struck between the parties.  I agree that the correct approach is to examine the actual bargain which has been struck between the parties and determine the core function of the contract \nby reference to this.  Therefore, the inclusion of a term which does not relate to the core function of the contract could not be considered necessary for its performance. \n \n96.\tIn determining the scope of the contract – and, indeed, whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is applicable to the processing at issue – the EDPB recommends considering the following questions: \n \n•\tWhat is the nature of the service being provided to the data subject? \n•\tWhat are its distinguishing characteristics? \n•\tWhat is the exact rationale of the contract (i.e. its substance and fundamental object)? \n•\tWhat are the essential elements of the contract? \n•\tWhat are the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract? How is the service promoted or advertised to the data subject? Would an ordinary user of the service reasonably expect that, considering the nature of the service, the envisaged processing will take place in order to perform the contract to which they are a party.”  \n \n97.\tI note that the Complaint does not specify with precision the processing operation(s) or extent thereof which the Complainant does not consider necessary for the performance of the contract between Meta Ireland and Instagram users.  Rather, the Complaint stated that operations “like advertisement, sponsored content, analysis and improvement of the controller’s products” could not be a “core element of a social network”.130  As I outlined above, there is a difference between what is necessary for a social network and what is necessary to perform a particular contract.  Nonetheless, in the interests of good faith, I will consider whether the delivery of personalised advertising (given that the Complainant focusses on these processing operations) is necessary for the performance of the contract between Meta Ireland and the Named Data Subject. \n \n98.\tPursuant to the Terms of Use, the contract between Meta Ireland and Instagram users is for the following services: \n \n“Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share. \n… \nFostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment. \n… \nDeveloping and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. … \nProviding consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. \n… \nEnsuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service. … \nConnecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about. \n… \nResearch and innovation.” \n \nI note, at this juncture, the Complainant’s submissions, made in the course of the Inquiry, that the services outlined above cannot be considered to be “contractual commitments” under Belgian law as they lack any “enforceable” obligations.   To reiterate my position in this regard as outlined in Schedule 1 to this Decision, in discharging my functions the 2018 Act and/or the GDPR, I would be acting outside the remit of the powers and functions contained therein if I were to consider the legality and/or validity of a contract by reference to domestic contract law.   \n \n99.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I carried out an analysis of the Terms of Use for the purposes of ascertaining the core functions of the contract.  Despite this analysis, the Complainant alleged that the Commission “has in no way investigated which specific clauses of the ‘Terms of [Use]’ are used by [Meta Ireland] to justify the specific purpose of its processing, the type of data processed, and the applicable legal basis”.   Given that I considered each aspect of the Terms of Use which related to personalised advertising, i.e. those which related to the scope of the Complaint (notwithstanding the fact that the Complaint was not clear in this respect), there is simply no truth to this assertion.  Rather, it appears to me that the Complainant conflated this issue with the sufficiency of the information provided which is dealt with in Issue 3 below.  \n \n100.\tIn respect of the above clauses of the contract between Meta Ireland and Instagram users, I am satisfied that the first (“Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share”) and the sixth (“Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about”) clauses concern personalisation.  In order to consider the substance of this clause, it is illustrative to outline the further detail provided in the Terms of Use in respect of both. \n \n101.\tIn respect of the first clause, the Terms of Use provides the following additional detail: \n \n“People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram” [my emphasis]. \n \n102.\tThe sixth clause of the Terms of Use states: \n \n“We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from thirdparty partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be \nmeaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences \non Instagram” [my emphasis]. \n \n103.\tI acknowledge the Complainant’s general position that advertising is not necessary in order to deliver a social network, and that simply placing terms providing for (personalised and/or targeted) advertising in the contract does not make them necessary.  While I accept that this may be true in some circumstances, I am not satisfied that the fulfilment of both clauses is not necessary in order to fulfil the specific contract entered into between Meta Ireland and Instagram users.  Indeed, it is Meta Ireland’s position that personalised advertising is one of its “core” functions.  To borrow from the language of the EDPB, it appears to me that personalised advertising is one of the “distinguishing factors” of Instagram and, as Instagram is promoted as such, “an ordinary user of the service [would] reasonably expect that, considering the nature of the service, the envisaged processing will take place in order to perform the contract”.  \n \n104.\tIn my view, the position of the Complainant seems to go so far as to say that processing will generally only be necessary for the performance of the contract if not carrying out the processing would make the performance of the contract impossible.  In this regard, it should be noted that the EDPB states that:  \n \n“as a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services. Normally, it would be hard to argue that the contract had not been performed because there were no behavioural ads. This is all the more supported by the fact that data subjects have the absolute right under Article \n21 to object to processing of their data for direct marketing purposes”. [my emphasis]  \n \t \n105.\tThe Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines, while not binding on the Commission, clearly set out a very restrictive view on when processing should be deemed to be “necessary” for the performance of a contract, and explicitly refer to personalised advertising as an example of processing that will usually not be necessary.  The use of the qualifier “as a general rule” is important to note.  Indeed, the EDPB has explicitly recognised that there may be some circumstances in which personalised advertising may well be considered necessary for the performance of a contract.  In this respect, I also note that the EDPB has acknowledged that the “personalisation of content may (but does not always) constitute an essential or expected element of certain online services”.   The core issue under consideration is whether, having regard the exact terms of the contract, the inclusion of behavioural advertising as a contractual term makes data processing conditional on the delivery of a contract, where that processing is not itself necessary to actually deliver the contract.  The counter-argument to this is that behavioural advertising is the core of both Meta Ireland’s business model and the bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users and, accordingly, processing in this regard is necessary to fulfil the contract between Meta Ireland and the Named Data Subject. \n \n106.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I expressed a provisional view that, in considering the specific contract entered into between Meta Ireland and Instagram users, it is made clear, from the first and sixth clauses, that the core of the service offered is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising.  I note that in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland stated that the text of the Terms of Use supports its position that “the delivery of personalised advertising is a core part of its service to users”.   Moreover, Meta Ireland went further and stated that Instagram users also “understand… that Meta Ireland offers a service that facilitates the creation of a unique personalised and social online experience for its users, including with respect to personalised advertising”.   The Complainant did not expressly consider these specific clauses in its submissions, either on the Preliminary Draft or during the course of the inquiry. \n \n107.\tIt remains my view that the text of the first and sixth clauses are clear that the core of the service offered by Meta Ireland is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising.  This is notwithstanding the EDPB’s view that processing cannot be rendered lawful by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR “simply because processing is necessary for the controller’s wider business model”.   Indeed, in considering this contract by reference to the criteria set out in paragraph 33 of the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines, further support for my position can be seen.  For example, the Terms of Use describe the Instagram service as being “personalised” and connects users with brands, including by means of providing “relevant” advertising and content.  It is clear that the Instagram service is advertised as offering a “personalised” experience, including by way of the advertising it delivers to users.   \n \n108.\tIn its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant stated that “there is no evidence for the speculation as to the view of an average data subject on the ‘bargain’”.139  While I accept that it is not impossible to ascertain the view of every data subject as to the nature of the bargain struck between that user and Meta Ireland, it is reasonable to assume that the average user would read the text of the Terms of Use prior to acceptance.  As the Instagram service is advertised (in the Terms of Use) as being predicated on personalised advertising, it is my view that any reasonable user would understand and expect that this is part of the core bargain that is being struck with Meta Ireland, albeit I acknowledge that users may prefer that the market offer alternative choices.  \nAs personalised advertising forms part of the core bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users, I am satisfied that any processing necessary for the delivery of such advertising may fall within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.   \n \n109.\tIn this regard, while I do consider the processing necessary for the performance of the particular contract, I am not making a determination as to whether the contract is impossible to perform in the absence of personalised advertising.  In respect of the question as to whether the “necessity” test requires a threshold of “impossibility”, I have already pointed out, and indeed also noted in the Preliminary Draft, that the Article 6(1)(b) Guidelines are not legally binding and do not necessarily determine the application of the general principles to specific cases.  In its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant considered it noteworthy that I acknowledged that these guidelines were non-binding in nature  whereas Meta Ireland shared the view that they were non-binding.    \n \n110.\tNotwithstanding my position that the guidelines are non-binding, it is important to emphasise that I agree with the majority of the arguments of both the Complainant and the EDPB in relation to the correct interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  However, I do have difficulty with a strict threshold of “impossibility” in the assessment of necessity. By “impossibility”, I am referring to the argument put forward that a particular term of a contract (here, behavioural advertising) is not necessary to deliver an overall service or contract.  In particular, I consider that is not correct to assess necessity as against the delivery of an overall service in the abstract.  Rather, as I have stated above, I consider the appropriate assessment to be one which considers what is necessary by reference to core function of the particular contract. \n \n111.\tI accept that either form of assessment will require an element of reasoning in the abstract (in particular, when considering the mutual perspectives and expectations), I am also of the view that it is not for an authority such as the Commission, tasked with the enforcement of data protection law, to make assessments as to what will or will not make the performance of a contract possible or impossible.  Instead, the general principles set out in the GDPR and explained by the EDPB in the guidelines must be applied.  That said, it must be emphasised that these principles must be applied on a case-by-case basis.  While the examples provided in any form of EDPB guidance are helpful and instructive, they are not necessarily conclusive of the position in any specific case and indeed do not purport to be.  This is particularly the case with the Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n \n112.\tFor completeness, I note that in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland expressed its view as to whether the necessity test encompasses an impossibility threshold.  Relying on Huber, Meta Ireland asserted that the CJEU consider that the “the concept of necessity is fact sensitive and must be considered in light of the specific circumstances (i.e. the context) of the processing and the purpose it aims to achieve”.   Without prejudice to this position, Meta Ireland also submitted that were impossibility an aspect of necessity, it would not, in any case, operate as a “blanket prohibition” on relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the legal basis for processing in this context.   In essence, it is Meta Ireland’s position that, in the specific context of the Instagram service, personalised advertising may constitute a distinguishing feature of said service which is an “exact rationale” and one of the “essential elements of the Terms of Use” for which the ordinary user would reasonably expect their personal data to be processed so as to receive the Instagram service as advertised.  \n \n113.\tIn the Draft Decision, I noted that, given that it involves a consideration of the specific contract between the relevant parties, it necessarily follows that any assessment of necessity in this context must be fact-specific to a certain degree.  In the Draft Decision, I also added that, as I do not consider “impossibility” to form part of a consideration of what is necessary for the performance of that specific contract, it was not necessary to consider Meta Ireland’s submissions on this particular point. \n \n114.\tOn the basis of the above, I concluded, in the Draft Decision, that neither Article 6(1)(b) nor any other provision of the GPDR preclude Meta Ireland from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for the delivery of a service based on behavioural advertising of the kind provided for under the contract between Meta Ireland and its users at issue in this Complaint.  In the Draft Decision, I noted that, as discussed below, other provisions of the GDPR (such as transparency, which I consider at Issue 3) act to strictly regulate the manner in which this service is to be delivered, and the information that should be given to users. \n \n115.\tHaving analysed the submissions of the parties in the course of the Inquiry and on the Preliminary Draft, the terms of the GDPR, and the CJEU jurisprudence and EDPB Guidelines, I found, in the Draft Decision, that there was no basis for the contention that Meta Ireland is precluded in principle from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purposes of legitimising the personal data processing activities involved in the provision of the Instagram service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service.  It was my view, as expressed in the Draft Decision, that there is nothing in the GDPR that restricts or prohibits the use of these terms in the context of processing personal data per se.  As has been set out earlier, and as set out by the Investigator, it is not for the Commission to rule on matters of contract law and contractual interpretation that extend beyond the remit of data protection law.  The lawful basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR simply states that personal data may be processed where it is necessary for the performance of a contract.  In other words and, as I have already set out in my analysis, the data may be processed if, without such processing, the contract could not be performed.  My view, as expressed in the Draft Decision, was that I was not convinced, for the reasons set out, that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR goes a step further and excludes all processing unless the fulfilment of some abstractly discerned purpose would be rendered impossible without that processing.  I was also of the view, as outlined in the Draft Decision, that this application conforms broadly to significant elements of the interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR proposed by the Complainant and by the EDPB. \n \n116.\tIn the Draft Decision, I noted that while I accepted that, as a general rule, the EPDB considers that processing for online behavioural advertising would not be necessary for the performance of a contract for online services, in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, I concluded that Meta Ireland may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of the Instagram service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users. \n \n117.\tI also noted, in the Draft Decision, that having regard to the scope of the Complaint and this Inquiry, as described above, this was not to be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on users’ personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n \n118.\tFollowing the circulation of the Commission’s Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned, for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections to this aspect of matters were raised by the supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden each raised an objection to the finding proposed under this particular heading.  Having considered the merits of those objections, the EDPB determined as follows: \n \n97. The EDPB considers it necessary to begin its assessment on the merits with a general description of the practice of behavioural advertising carried out in the context of the Instagram service before determining whether the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is appropriate for this practice in the present case, based on the Instagram Terms of Use and the nature of its products and features as described in those terms. The requests for preliminary rulings made to the CJEU in the cases C-252/21 and C-446/21 to which some of the documents in the file refer contain helpful descriptions of Meta’s behavioural advertising practices in the context of its Facebook services . Given that behavioural advertising is also carried out in the context of the Instagram service, and given the similarities between the two services, relying on the same Data Policy , the EDPB considers that these cases are also useful in gaining an understanding of the practice of behavioural advertising in relation to the Instagram service. Furthermore, in the request for a preliminary ruling in case C-252/21, it is mentioned that if the CJEU answers the question 7 positively (regarding the competence of a Member State national competition authority to determine, when assessing the balance of interests whether data processing and their terms comply with the GDPR) that the questions 3 to 5 must be answered in relation to data from the use of the group’s Instagram service.  In addition, Meta IE makes reference to both of these requests for preliminary rulings in its submissions, and therefore clearly considers them relevant to this case . \n\n \n98.\tThese requests for preliminary rulings mention that Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device . According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way. \n \n99.\tThe EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service, as well as off the Facebook service itself, through third party websites and apps which are connected to Facebook.com via programming interfaces (“Facebook Business Tools”), including the Instagram service . Furthermore, among the aspects described in the Instagram Terms of Use is “Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.” which involves “shar[ing] technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you.” It is therefore clear that personal data is shared between Facebook companies (”We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads (...)” \n \n100.\tThese are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and expect behavioural advertising when they accept the Instagram Terms of Use and perceive it as necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service . Accordingly, the EDPB further considers that the IE SA could have added to its Draft Decision a description of behavioural advertising that Meta IE conducts through the Instagram service to appropriately substantiate its reasoning leading to its acceptance of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for that practice in accordance with the IE SA’s duty to state the reasons for an individual decision . \n \n101.\tNotwithstanding the EDPB’s considerations above, the EDPB considers that there is sufficient information in the file for the EDPB to decide whether the IE SA needs to change its Draft Decision insofar as it rejects the complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its offering of the Instagram service, based on its Terms of Use. \n \n102.\tAs described above in section 4.1., the IE SA concludes in Finding 2 of its Draft Decision that the Complainant’s case was not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by Meta IE on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Use, neither Article 6(1)(b) GDPR nor any other provision of the GDPR precludes Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to deliver a service, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service . The IE SA considers that, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE \n \n\nmay in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its Instagram service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of its service offered to and accepted by its users . The IE SA considers the core of the service offered by Meta IE is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising . The IE SA considers a reasonable user would understand and expect this having read the Terms of Use . Meta IE supports this conclusion of the IE SA . \n \n103.\tTo assess these claims of the IE SA and Meta IE, the EDPB considers it necessary to recall the general objectives that the GDPR pursues, which must guide its interpretation, together with the wording of its provisions and its normative context . \n \n104.\tThe GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the TFEU, which constitute EU primary law . As the CJEU clarified, “an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law” . In the face of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and sharing, the GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control of their own personal data . By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection throughout the EU, the GDPR seeks to ensure the free movement of personal data within the EU . The GDPR acknowledges that the right to data protection needs to be balanced against other fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to conduct a business, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and has these considerations integrated into its provisions . The GDPR, pursuant to EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to a data subject and his/her dignity, and not as a commodity data subjects can trade away through a contract . The CJEU provided additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests . \n \n105.\tThe principle of lawfulness of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to the protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process the personal data of individuals if it is able to rely on one of the bases found in the exhaustive and restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR . \n \n106.\tThe principle of lawfulness goes hand in hand with the principles of fairness and transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller . \n \n107.\tThe EDPB agrees with the IE SA and Meta IE that there is no hierarchy between these legal bases . However, this does not mean that a controller, as Meta IE in the present case, has \n\nabsolute discretion to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller may only rely on one of the legal bases established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the processing at stake . A specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet its requirements set by the GDPR and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data . The legal basis will not be appropriate if its application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect “effet utile” pursued by the GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR . These criteria stem from the content of the GDPR and the interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given thereto described in paragraph 104 above . \n \n108.\tThe GDPR makes Meta IE, as a data controller for the processing at stake, directly responsible for complying with the Regulation’s principles, including the processing of data in a lawful, fair and transparent manner, and any obligations derived therefrom . This obligation applies even where the practical application of GDPR principles such as those of Article 5(1)(a) and Article (5)(2) GDPR is inconvenient or runs counter to the commercial interests of Meta IE and its business model. The controller is also obliged to be able to demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations derived therefrom, such as that it meets the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis . \n \n109.\tThe first condition to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process the data subject’s data is that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, has to be able to demonstrate that (a) a contract exists and (b) the contract is valid pursuant to applicable national contract laws . \n \n110.\tBoth the IE SA and Meta IE consider that the Terms of Use make up the entire agreement between the Instagram user and Meta IE and that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document setting out information to fulfil the GDPR transparency obligations . The IE SA thus considers that the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR takes place, is the Terms of Use . \n \n111.\tThe IE SA and Meta IE argue that the GDPR does not confer a broad and direct competence to supervisory authorities to interpret or assess the validity of contracts . \n \n112.\tThe EDPB agrees that SAs do not have under the GDPR a broad and general competence in contractual matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks that the GDPR bestows on SAs imply a limited competence to assess a contract’s general validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment of their tasks under the GDPR. Otherwise, the SAs would see their monitoring and enforcement task under Article 57(1)(a) GDPR limited to actions such as verifying whether the processing at stake is necessary for the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a processor under Article 28(3) GDPR and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate safeguards pursuant to the GDPR. Pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation, the SAs would thus be obliged to always consider a contract valid, even in situations where it is manifestly evident that it is not, for instance because there is no proof of agreement between the two parties, or because the contract does not comply with its Member State’s rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child . \n \n\n113.\tAs the DE and NL SAs  argue, the validity of the contract for the Instagram service between Meta IE and the complainant is questionable, given the strong indications that the Complainant was unaware of entering into a contract, and (as the IE SA establishes with its Finding 3 of its Draft Decision) serious transparency issues in relation to the legal basis relied on. In contract law, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of the contract and the obligations of both parties to the contract in order to willingly enter into such contract. \n \n114.\tNotwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB, refers to its previous interpretative guidance on this matter to provide below its analysis on whether behavioural advertising is objectively necessary for Meta IE to provide its Instagram service to the user based on its Terms of Use and the nature of the service . \n \n115.\tThe EDPB recalls  that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “[i]t is important to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance” . As the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject . \n \n116.\tMoreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract . \n \n117.\tThe IE SA accepts the EDPB’s position that, as a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services . However, the IE SA considers that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the Instagram service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users . \n \n118.\tThe IE SA views behavioural advertising as “the core of both Meta Ireland’s business model and the bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users” . In support of this consideration, the IE SA refers to the ”first and sixth clauses” of “the specific contract entered into between Meta IE and Instagram users” . The IE SA considers that from the text of these “clauses” it is “clear that the core of the service offered by Meta Ireland is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising. ” The IE SA considers that this position is supported by the fact that “the Terms of Use describe the Instagram service as being ‘personalised’ and connects users with brands, including by means of providing ‘relevant’ advertising and content.” Based on this, the IE SA is of the view that “It is clear that the Instagram service is advertised as offering a 'personalised' experience, including by way of the advertising it delivers to users .” The IE SA considers that as the Instagram service is “advertised” in its Terms of Use “as being predicated on personalised advertising (...) any reasonable user would expect and understand that this is part of the core bargain that is being struck (...)” but acknowledges that “users may prefer that the market offer alternative choices .” \n \n\n \n119.\tOn this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under EU law. It must be interpreted in a manner that fully reflects the objective pursued by an EU instrument, in this case, the GDPR . Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision and the GDPR’s general objective of protecting the right to the protection of personal data or contradicts Article 8 of the Charter . On the processing of data in the Facebook services, Advocate General Rantos supports a strict interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR among other legal bases, particularly to avoid any circumvention of the requirement for consent . Given the similarities between the Facebook and Instagram services, as explained above in paragraph 97, and the fact that this case may concern the legal basis for processing of personal data for the Instagram service . \n \n120.\tAs the IE SA states in its Draft Decision, “Instagram is a global online social network service which allows registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video calls and video chats, and by sending images and video files .” Meta IE promotes among its prospective and current users the perception that the main purpose of the Instagram service and for which it processes its users’ data is to enable them to share content and communicate with others. Meta IE presents its Instagram service on its “About” page of its website as a platform which “give[s] people the power to build community and bring[s] the world closer together .” At the beginning of its Terms of Use, Meta IE presents its mission for the Instagram service as “To bring you closer to the people and things you love .” The description of the aspects of the service includes “Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate.” \n \n121.\tThe fact that the Terms of Use do not provide for any contractual obligation binding Meta IE to offer personalised advertising to the Instagram users and any contractual penalty if Meta IE fails to do so shows that, at least from the perspective of the Instagram user, this processing is not necessary to perform the contract . Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation between Meta IE and the specific advertisers that pay for Meta IE’s targeted display of their advertisements in the Instagram service to Instagram users, but it is not presented as an obligation towards the Instagram users. \n \n122.\tNor does Meta IE’s business model of offering services, at no monetary cost for the user to generate income by behavioural advertisement to support its Instagram service make this processing necessary to perform the contract. Under the principle of lawfulness of the GDPR and its Article 6, it is the business model which must adapt itself and comply with the requirements that the GDPR sets out in general and for each of the legal bases and not the reverse. As the Advocate General Rantos stressed recently in his opinion on Meta IE’s processing in Facebook, based on Article 5(2) GDPR, it is the controller (Meta IE) in this case who is responsible for demonstrating that the personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR . \n \n123.\tAs the EDPB provided in its guidance, “Assessing what is ‘necessary’ involves a combined, fact-based assessment of the processing ‘for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared to other options for achieving the same goal’. If there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not ‘necessary’. Article 6(1)(b) will not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service or for taking \n\nrelevant pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes. ” \n \n124.\tOn the question of whether here there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives to behavioural advertising that make this processing not “necessary” , the EDPB considers that there are. The AT and SE SAs mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, which do not involve intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users . In his recent opinion on Facebook, Advocate General Rantos also refers to the Austrian Government’s “pertinent” observation that in the past, Meta IE allowed Facebook users to choose between a chronological presentation and a personalised presentation of newsfeed content, which, in his view, proves that an alternative method is possible . By considering the existence of alternative practices to behavioural advertising that are more respectful of the Instagram users’ right to data protection, the EDPB, as the Advocate General did in relation to Facebook users, aims to assess if this processing is objectively necessary to deliver the service offered, as perceived by the Instagram user whose personal data is processed, and not to dictate the nature of Meta IE’s service or impose specific business models on controllers, as Meta IE and the IE SA respectively argue . The EDPB considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes . \n \n125.\tThe EDPB considers that the absolute right available to data subjects, under Article 21(2)(3) GDPR to object to the processing of their data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes further supports its consideration that, as a general rule, the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary to perform a contract. The processing cannot be necessary to perform a contract if a data subject has the possibility to opt out from it at any time, and without providing any reason. \n \n126.\tThe EDPB finds that a reasonable user cannot expect that their personal data is being processed for behavioural advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to this processing in its Instagram Terms of Use (which Meta IE and the IE SA consider as constituting the entirety of the contract), or because of the “wider circumstances” or “recognised public awareness of this form of processing” derived from its “widespread prevalence of OBA processing” to which the IE SA refers . Behavioural advertising, as briefly described in paragraph 98 above, is a set of processing operations of personal data of great technical complexity, which has a particularly massive and intrusive nature. In view of the characteristics of behavioural advertising, coupled with the very brief and insufficient information that Meta provides about it in the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy (a separate document that the IE SA and Meta IE do not even consider part of the contractual obligations), the EDPB finds it extremely difficult to argue that an average user can fully grasp it, be aware of its consequences and impact on their rights to privacy and data protection, and reasonably expect it solely based on the Instagram Terms of Use. The EDPB recalls its Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in which it argues that the expectations of the average data subject need to be consider in light, not only of the terms of service but also the way this service is promoted to users . Advocate General Rantos expresses similar doubts where he says in relation to Facebook behavioural advertising practices “I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for”  and adds in a footnote that he does not “believe that the collection and \n\nuse of personal data outside Facebook are necessary for the provision of the services offered as part of the Facebook profile” . \n \n127.\tThe EDPB notes that the mission of the Instagram service, as expressed in its Terms of Use, is formulated in a vague and broad manner (“To bring you closer to the people and things you love.”) When using the Instagram service, a user is primarily confronted with the possibility of viewing photographs and videos by people or organisations that they follow, as well as sharing such content with their followers. This is acknowledged by the IE SA which provides the following description of the Instagram service in its Draft Decision: “Instagram is a global online social network service which allows registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video calls and video chats, and by sending images and video files .” \n \n128.\tBased on the considerations above, the EDPB considers that the main purpose for which users use Instagram and accept its Terms of Use is to share content and communicate with others, not to receive personalised advertisements. \n \n129.\tMeta IE infringed its transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR by not clearly informing the complainant and other users of the Instagram Service specific processing operations, the personal data processed in them, the specific purposes they serve, and the legal basis on which each of the processing operations relies, as the IE SA concludes in its Draft Decision . The EDPB considers that this fundamental failure of Meta IE to comply with its transparency obligations contradicts the IE SA’s finding that Instagram users could reasonably expect online behavioural advertising as being necessary for the performance of their contract (as described in the Instagram Terms of Use) with Meta IE . \n \n130.\tThe EDPB recalls that “controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis is” and that this is “particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects”, because “[d]epending on the circumstances, data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR when signing a contract or accepting terms of service” . Article 6(1)(b) GDPR requires the existence, validity of a contract, and the processing being necessary to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the Parties (in this case the data subject) is not provided with sufficient information to know that they are signing a contract, the processing of personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes and on which legal basis, and how this processing is necessary to perform the services delivered. These transparency requirements are not only an additional and separate obligation, as the IE SA seems to imply, but also an indispensable and constitutive part of the legal basis . \n \n131.\tThe risks to the rights of data subjects derived from this asymmetry of information and an inappropriate reliance on this legal basis are higher in situations such as in the present case, in which the Complainant and other Instagram users face a “take it or leave it” situation resulting from the standard contract pre-formulated by Meta IE and the lack of few alternative services in the market. The EU legislator has regularly identified and aimed to address with multiple legal instruments these risks and the imbalance between the parties to consumer contracts. For example, Directive 93/13/EEC \n\non unfair terms in consumer contracts  mandates, as the transparency obligations under the GDPR, the use of plain, intelligible language in the terms of the contracts offered to consumers . This Directive even provides that where there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail . Processing of personal data that is based on what is deemed to be an unfair term under this Directive will generally not be consistent with the requirement under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that the processing is lawful and fair \n. \n \n132.\tAdvocate General Rantos concludes in reference to Meta IE that the fact that an undertaking providing a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social network for private users “does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it .” In line with the logic of this argument, the EDPB considers that the dominant position of Meta IE also plays an important role in the assessment of Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for its Instagram service and its risks to data subjects, especially considering how deficiently Meta IE informs the Instagram users of the data it strictly needs to process to deliver the service. \n \n133.\tGiven that the main purpose for which a user uses Instagram service is to share and receive content, and communicate with others , and that Meta IE conditions their use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the behavioural advertising they include, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue . The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and 7 and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. \n \n134.\tThe EDPB agrees with the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs that there is a risk that the Draft Decision’s failure to establish Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation of it, nullifies this provision and makes lawful theoretically any collection and reuse of personal data in connection with the performance of a contract with a data subject . Meta IE currently leaves the complainant and other users of the Instagram service with a single choice. They may either contract away their right to freely determine the processing of their personal data and  submit to its processing for the obscure, and intrusive purpose of behavioural advertising, which they can neither expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information Meta IE provides to them. Or, they may decline accepting Instagram Terms of Use and thus be excluded from a service that enables them to communicate, share content with and receive content from millions of users and for which there are currently few realistic alternatives. This exclusion would thus also adversely affect their freedom of expression and information. \n \n135.\tThis precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There \nwould be the risk that some controllers argue some connection between the processing of the personal data of their consumers and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as possible and advance their economic interests at the expense of the safeguards for data subjects. Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis, instead of others such as consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). As a result, owing to the number of users of the Instagram service, the market power, and influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive business model, the risks derived from the current findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the Complainant and the millions of users of Instagram service in the EEA and affect the protection of the hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR . \n \n136.\tThe EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs  to Finding 2 of the Draft Decision in that the behavioural advertising performed by Meta IE in the context of the Instagram service is objectively not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s alleged contract with data users for the Instagram service and is not an essential or core element of it. \n \n137.\tIn conclusion, the EDPB decides that the Meta IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the complainant’s personal data in the context of Instagram Terms of Use and therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data for the purposes of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has not relied on any other legal basis to process personal data in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use for the purposes of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has consequently infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing personal data. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Instagram Terms of Use and to include an infringement of Article 6 (1) GDPR based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified. \n \n \nFinding 2:  \nOn the basis of the above, and as directed by the EDPB further to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Meta Ireland was not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use. \n \n5 \tISSUE 3 – WHETHER META IRELAND PROVIDED THE REQUISITE INFORMATION ON THE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING ON FOOT OF ARTICLE 6(1)(B) GDPR AND WHETHER IT DID SO IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER \nIntroduction \n \n \n119. Having considered the legal basis of processing in connection with the Instagram service – in particular, processing for the purposes of delivering behavioural advertising – I will now consider whether Meta Ireland provided the requisite information as to the legal basis for processing on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and whether it did so in a transparent manner, such as to comply with its transparency obligations under the GDPR. \n \nRelevant Provisions \n \n120.\tAs I stated above, Article 5(1)(a) outlines the principles underpinning data processing and provides that “[p]ersonal data shall be … processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”.  Pursuant to Article 5(2), responsibility for demonstrating compliance with Article 5(1) rests with the controller. \n \n121.\tRecital 39 provides further details as regard the principle of transparency.  It states that processing: \n \n“should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data”. \n \n122.\tThe precise meaning of “transparency” for the purposes of the GDPR is delineated in Recital 58 GDPR.  In essence, a controller complies with the transparency principle when the information it provides to data subject, or indeed the public more generally, is “concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and … clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used.” \n \n123.\tAs detailed in Recital 60 GDPR, there is a strong nexus between the principle of transparency and the provision of information to data subjects.  Indeed, Recital 60 states that: \n \n“The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data.” \n \n124.\tArticle 13 GDPR outlines the information which must be provided to data subjects where personal data are collected from those data subjects.  In particular, Article 13(1)(c) provides that information as to “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing” must be provided to the data subject(s) at the time personal data is obtained.  \n \n125.\tThe nature of the extent of information to be provided to data subjects is further described in Article 12 GDPR.  In this regard, Article 12(1) provides that such information must be in a “concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language” but need not necessarily be in writing.   Indeed, pursuant to Article 12(7) GDPR, information provided in accordance with the controller’s obligations under Article 13 and 14 may be accompanied by “standardised icons” so as to give an overview of the relevant processing in “an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner”.  \n \n126.\tThere are limited exceptions to the provision of such information.  Indeed, Recital 62 GDPR provides that  \n \n“it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort”. \n \n127.\tFor completeness, I note that Article 14 GDPR provides detail as to the information to be provided where personal data has not been obtained from the data subjects themselves.  In essence, this concerns information to be provided to non-users.  As the scope of the Complaint was limited to registered users of the Instagram service, the substantive obligations which arise under Article 14 will not be considered further for the purposes of this  Decision except insofar as the text of Article 14 may be relevant to the interpretation of the obligations under Articles 12 and 13 GDPR. \n \nTransparency Obligations – General Comments \n \n128.\tIn considering transparency obligations, I think it necessary to draw a distinction between the principles of transparency which are contained in the Article 5 GDPR and the information requirements contained in Article 12 to 14 GDPR.  While the information requirements set out in Articles 12 to 14 GDPR go towards transparency, and indeed may assist my assessment of whether the principle of transparency has been discharged by the controller, non-compliance with Article 12 to 14 GDPR does not necessarily imply an infringement of Article 5. \n \n129.\tAccordingly, I will first consider whether the obligations set out in Article 12 and 13 GDPR have been complied with.  As Article 13 sets out the information that ought to be provided to data subjects and Article 12 concerns the manner and/or means by which this information is to be provided, I will first consider whether sufficient information has been provided and then assess whether any information has been provided in the appropriate manner and/or form.  I will subsequently consider whether the broader transparency principle set out in Article 5 GDPR has been complied with. \n \nThe “Layered” Approach \n \n130.\tWhen considering the issues to be considered in the course of this  Decision, I set out my reasons for my disagreement with the Investigator’s distinction between the issue of whether the Named Data Subject was misled and whether the Instagram Terms of Use and/or Data Policy complies with the transparency requirements of the GDPR.  As I outlined above, it is my view that a failure by a controller to adhere to the transparency requirements is likely to have the direct result that the data subject is misled.   \n \n131.\tIn considering whether the transparency requirements had been complied with in the context of the Instagram service, the Investigator adopted a “layered approach” whereby he considered each “layer” of information in isolation on the basis that each layer must independently comply with Article 12(1).   Meta Ireland did not agree with this approach taken by the Investigator and submitted that the information provided should be assessed “holistically” as opposed to a “layerby-layer basis”.   According to Meta Ireland, this would otherwise have the effect that it is required to “provide a disproportionate level of detail within each layer of information”.148 \n \n132.\tThe Investigator did not agree with Meta Ireland’s submissions.  In this respect, he formed the view that: \n \n“Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires the provision of concrete and specific information, not merely the creation of an overall impression about the controller’s processing activities. Accordingly, in order to assess the layered provision of information by a controller, it is necessary to consider discrete sources of information independently, in order to arrive at an overall view as to compliance. There can be no “holistic” conclusion on Facebook’s compliance with Article 13(1)(c) which is not fundamentally based on an examination of the actual information provided to the data subject. … \n… \nThe investigator also considers that each distinct layer of information must comply independently with the requirement of Article 12(1) GDPR regarding the provision of information ‘in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language’”.  \n \nFor completeness, I note that Meta Ireland, in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, reaffirmed its position that the “layered” approach, as adopted by the Investigator, was not envisaged in assessing compliance with the transparency obligations in the GDPR.   Rather it is Meta Ireland’s view that “the sole question is whether cumulatively, the data subject has been provided with the information required under the GDPR”.  \n \n133.\tWith respect, as I outlined in the Preliminary Draft, I do not agree that such a layer-by-layer approach should be adopted in considering whether an entity has complied with their transparency requirements.  While Article 12(1) GDPR concerns the form in which information should be provided to data subjects, it is focussed on the addressing the potential barriers which may prevent the information being received and/or understood by the data subject.  In this regard, I note that the reference to “using clear and plain language” in the provision of information ensures that the data subject is not hindered or otherwise impeded from receiving the requisite information as a result of an inability to understand technical jargon.  Similarly, the requirement that the information be “concise” operates to prevent information fatigue by the data subject as a result of the information being contained in a lengthy text.   \n \n134.\tMoreover, Article 12(1) GDPR provides that a controller “shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14” [my emphasis].  It follows that a controller’s Article 12 obligations are not considered in isolation from its Articles 13 or 14 obligations; rather, there is an interrelationship between these obligations.  Articles 13 and 14 require that certain material must be provided to data subjects and Article 12 sets out the manner and/or form in which this information is conveyed.  There is no suggestion that the information required by Articles 13 and 14 must be provided in any particular “layer” of information; the obligation is that the information is provided and is set out in the manner set out in Article 12.  \nWhile there is a certain discretion in how this information is provided, an individual “layer” of information cannot be assessed by reference to Article 12 GDPR in isolation of the information required by Articles 13 and/or 14 GDPR. \n \n135.\tIndeed, it is my view that the appropriate manner in which to assess compliance with the transparency obligations is to first consider whether the requisite information has been provided before examining whether that information has been provided in the correct form.  This does not mean that a controller’s “layered” approach necessarily complies with Articles 12 and 13; rather, it remains the case that the information required by Article 13 may not ultimately be set out in the manner required by Article 12(1) GDPR.  It does not follow, however, that this necessitates or justifies an abstract or isolated assessment of each “layer” of information for compliance with Article 12(1) GDPR.  Accordingly, I will examine the information in a more holistic manner for compliance with Articles 12 and 13 GDPR. \n \n136.\tFor completeness, I am not expressing any view or preference in respect of the merits of adopting a “layered” approach.  In this regard, I note that the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Transparency (the “Transparency Guidelines”) explicitly recommend that controllers use a “layered” approach,  which was endorsed by the EDPB at its first plenary session.  Rather, I am stating that while the approach taken by the Investigator in examining compliance in a “layer-bylayer” way was robust and comprehensive, it did not consider the information provided in a sufficiently holistic way.  It is my view that it is not necessary to consider whether each individual layer is deficient or otherwise on the basis that there will be an infringement of Article 12 if the layers, viewed cumulatively, lack  the information required by Article 13 GDPR. \n \n137.\tAs I noted above, the Investigator adopted a “layer-by-layer” approach in assessing compliance.  While he formed the general view that Meta Ireland did not misled data subjects as to fact that the processing in connection with the Instagram service was not on the basis of consent, he was nonetheless of the view that the individual “layers”  of information did not comply with Article 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  While I note that Meta Ireland contended that the information provided complied with Article 12(1), 13(1)(c) and 5(1)(a) GDPR, much of the submissions on the Draft Inquiry Report focussed on Meta Ireland’s disagreement with the “layered” approach taken by the \nInvestigator.  For the reasons I have outlined above, I will not follow this “layered” approach but \nwill consider the information more cumulatively and holistically, referring to the views of the Complainant, Meta Ireland and the Investigator, as appropriate. \n \nInformation provided to the Data Subject in respect of the purposes and/or legal basis of processing \n \n138.\tAs a preliminary point, I note that Meta Ireland confirmed, in submissions dated 28 September 2018, that personal data is collected directly from data subjects in the context of the Instagram service.   Accordingly, Article 13 is relevant.  Given that the focus of the Complaint is on whether Meta Ireland has a lawful basis for processing of personal data in connection with the Instagram service, I am satisfied that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR – which concerns information in respect of “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing” – is of particular relevance. \n \nThe Complaint and Meta Ireland’s Submissions and the Views of the Investigator \n \n139.\tThe Complainant alleged that Meta Ireland had “misled” Instagram users on the basis that a user could not identify “what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis” and was therefore “inherently non-transparent”, contrary to the requirements of Article 13(c) GDPR.   The Complainant also stated that the manner in which the information was provided by “the controller at least lead the data subject to belief [sic] that all these processing operations are (also) based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or 9(2)(a) of the GDPR”.  \n \n140.\tIn the course of the Inquiry, Meta Ireland made extensive submissions in respect of compliance with Article 13 GDPR.  In submissions dated 28 September 2018, Meta Ireland stated that, in its view, it complied with the information requirements in Article 13(1) and (2) by providing the relevant information at the time the personal data was collected.   Meta Ireland further stated that the information was provided by way of the user engagement flow and, on a continuous basis, in the Data Policy.  \n \n141.\tIn this regard, Meta Ireland further submitted that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires controllers to be transparent as regards the purposes of processing generally as opposed to information as to the purposes of specific processing operations.159  Moreover, in submissions on the Draft Report, Meta Ireland emphasised its view that, when implementing the information requirements under Article \n12 to 14 GDPR, controllers have discretion as to the means and method of the provision of information.  \n \n142.\tThe Investigator emphasised that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR states that information concerning both the purposes of processing and the identification of the relevant legal basis must be provided to data subjects.   However, as the Complainant did not – or, as it submitted, could not - identify the types of processing which occurred as a result of accepting the Terms of Use, the Investigator was of the view that only the obligation to provide information as to legal basis for processing is within the scope of the Complaint.    \n \n143.\tIn this respect, the Investigator noted that “processing”, interpreted in line with Article 4(2) GDPR, referred to “operations, or sets of operations, carried out on personal data or sets of personal data”.   In his view, “processing” did not refer to specific processing operations but referred to the broader concept of a “set of processing operations”.   In essence, it was his view that Article 13(1)(c) has the objective of “ensuring the intelligible provision of information on the legal basis for separate and distinct types of processing”.   The provision of information in accordance with the requirements of Article 13(1)(c) obliges the controller to (1) “specify the legal basis in question” and (2) “identify the discrete ‘set of operations’ performed (i.e. the processing) in connection with that legal basis”.   \n \nConsideration of the Information to be Provided \n \n144.\tIn considering the obligations under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, I agree with the Investigator that the term “processing” should be construed in line with Article 4(2) GDPR.  I have set out the full text of Article 4(2) above.  Article 4(2) GDPR clearly provides that, “[f]or the purposes of the GDPR”, processing refers to “any operations or set of operations”.  The clause, “[f]or the purposes of the GDPR”, clearly implies that where the term “processing” appears in the text of the GDPR, the definition contained in Article 4(2) is to be used.  I further note that, while the text of the GDPR does not define the term “operation”, Article 4(2) contains a list of examples which illustrate the type of activities which may constitute an operation.  I note that the inclusion of the phrase “such as” before the list indicates that these examples are not exhaustive.  It follows, in my view, that any action carried out on personal data, including its collection, may constitute an operation. \n \n145.\tIn this regard, it is also illustrative to consider Recital 60 GDPR which states that “principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes” [my emphasis].  The Article 29 Working Group also referred to processing operations in this context, stating: \n \n“Transparency is intrinsically linked to fairness and the new principle of accountability under the GDPR. It also follows from Article 5.2 that the controller must always be able to demonstrate that personal data are processed in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. Connected to this, the accountability principle requires transparency of processing operations in order that data controllers are able to demonstrate compliance with their obligations under the GDPR” [my emphasis].  \n \n146.\tAs set out above, Meta Ireland’s position is that the term “processing” for the purposes of Article 13 GDPR does not encompass “processing operations” on the basis that Article 13 refers to “processing” as opposed to “processing operations”.   I did not agree with this position in the Preliminary Draft.  As I outlined in the Preliminary Draft, the definition contained in Article 4(2) GDPR is that to be applied “[f]or the purposes of the GDPR”.  It logically follows that, where the term processing is used throughout the GDPR, the definition set out in Article 4(2) applies, i.e. processing should be construed to mean “processing operations or sets of operations”.  I would further add that I also disagree with Meta Ireland’s submission that, as “the word ‘operation’ has been deliberately omitted from Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, it is not appropriate to read in language based on Recital 60 GDPR”.169  As I outlined in the Preliminary Draft, an ordinary reading of Article 4(2) GDPR is that the word processing – where it appears in the GDPR – should be construed to refer to processing as “operations or set of operations”; logically this is applicable to Article 13(1)(c). \n \n147.\tIn response to the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland expressed disagreement with my “literal interpretation” of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and asserted that its own “interpretation directly tracks the actual wording of the relevant GDPR provision which stipulates only that two items of information be provided about the processing (i.e. purposes and legal bases)”.   In this regard, Meta Ireland further stated that it \n \n“disagrees with the Commission’s use of Article 4(2) GDPR to interpret Article 13(1)(c) GDPR to refer to processing operations, particularly where the term “processing operations” has in fact been used elsewhere in the GDPR but deliberately not used in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. The Commission’s view does not adequately explain why the drafters of the GDPR made this distinction (if as the Commission alleges “purposes” and “processing operations” are one and the same) and justify why the Commission is entitled to make such a distinction despite the clear wording of the GDPR”.   \n \n148.\tIn essence, Meta Ireland disagreed that Article 4(2) operates as an interpretive aid in this context.   In particular, Meta Ireland is of the view that “Article 13(1)(c) GDPR identifies only two specific features of the processing that need to be provided” and, as other subsections of Article 13 relate to other aspects of processing, it does not follow that the definition of processing provided for in Article 4(2) GDPR is applicable to any of the subsections of Article 13.173  Meta Ireland further alleged that it was not the legislator’s intention that the provision be construed in the manner I proposed  and that my proposed interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR is “is not clear or obvious from the GDPR itself”.  \n \n149.\tIt appears to me that this argument is premised on the suggestion that, as the various subsections of Article 13 GDPR require the disclosure to data subjects of specific aspects of the broader activity or “processing” as defined by Article 4(2) GDPR, such as the identity of a recipient, the duration of the processing, this implies that the broader definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) cannot be applicable.  I do not share this view.  While I note that Article 13 does not specifically include the word “operation”, it remains my view that Meta Ireland’s position would render the definition in Article 4(2) meaningless.  Indeed, it would be contrary to the express purpose of Article 4(2) GDPR if the understanding of processing could only include processing operations where the term “operation” was deliberately included.  To consider otherwise would be contrary to the literal interpretation of Article 4(2) GDPR.  I am therefore satisfied that the term “processing” in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR should be construed to include processing operations or sets of operations and this is clear from the text of the GDPR. \n \n150.\tI further note Meta Ireland’s submissions that, as Article 13(1) GDPR includes the phrase “at the time data is first collected”, it therefore refers only to “prospective processing”.  Indeed, Meta Ireland submitted that, on this basis, Article 13(1)(c) GDPR does not relate to ongoing processing operations, but is concerned solely with information on “intended processing”.176  Given the fundamental role which transparency obligations plays in the exercise of data subjects rights, it cannot be the case that the legislator intended such a narrow approach to the concept of processing. \n \n151.\tIn its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland also disagreed that there is a requirement in Article 13(1)(c) to link purposes with individual legal bases or equally to processing operations or \nset of operations.   In this vein, Meta Ireland have alleged that my proposed approach does not further the objectives of the transparency obligations.   Indeed, it is Meta Ireland’s position that the “applicable question is whether the actual obligation imposed by the GDPR has been complied with, not whether or not an additional category of information or linkage not referenced in GDPR has also been provided”.  \n \n152.\tAs I have outlined above, the text of Article 13(1)(c) clearly states that there is a requirement to provide information as to “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing”.  Its literal meaning is to require controllers to provide information to data subjects concerning the purposes of the processing and the legal basis for that processing.  In respect of the purposes of processing, I would further add that the inclusion of the phrase “for which the personal data are intended” in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR indicates that data controllers should also provide the information so as to enable the data subject(s) understand, in broad terms, which personal data is – or will be – undergoing processing, for which processing operations or set of operations and which legal basis is applicable.  It is not the case that purposes and legal bases can simply be cited in the abstract and detached from the personal data processing they concern.  Accordingly, there must be a link drawn between the purposes and the legal basis to ensure that the data subject has meaningful information. \n \n153.\tIt is my view that Meta Ireland’s position cannot be reconciled with a literal interpretation of Article 13(1)(c); nonetheless, for completeness, I have considered whether its position is nonetheless justified by a systemic reading based on the legislator’s objective and the contents of the GDPR as a whole.  In relation to the argument I have just considered, it is important to note that transparency, both under the GDPR and in the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines considered below in this  Decision, is directly linked to the principle of accountability under the GDPR. In order to ensure that actual or intended processing is carried out in an accountable and transparent manner, the interpretation proposed by Meta Ireland cannot be accepted. Indeed, the absence of any level of specificity as to what the data controller is doing with the data, and more fundamentally what data they are processing at all, would render information on the purposes of this unspecified processing almost useless to a data subject. In the absence of information on the nature of the data being used and the nature of the processing being carried out, it would be virtually impossible to exercise data subject rights in an informed manner. Such an absence of transparency and accountability could not be reconciled with a purposive or systematic reading of the GDPR.   \n \n154.\tI further note that Meta Ireland cited some of the GDPR’s preparatory materials in support of its view that the legislator expressly decided to exclude particular information as to processing operations as part of Article 13.   In particular, Meta Ireland sought to rely on the exclusion of the following: “the existence of certain processing activities and operations for which a personal data impact assessment has indicated that there may be a high risk”.   The decision of the legislator to not include a requirement to provide such information has no impact on the applicability of the clear definition of “processing” in Article 4(2) GDPR, and therefore does not affect the appropriate literal interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. In any purposive or systematic approach to interpreting the provision, the decision not to require information on processing which the controller itself has found to be high risk does not suggest that the controller would not otherwise be required to disclose the existence of that processing. It would simply require a controller to disclose that a data protection impact assessment indicated the presence of a high risk. This therefore provides no evidence that the legislator excluded in any way the interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR being proposed. \n \n155.\tIn considering what constitutes the purposes of processing, it is illustrative to consider the six interconnected principles which underpin the data protection framework, as set out in Article 5 GDPR.  These core principles contained in Article 5 focus on the purpose(s) of the relevant processing; this is evident as Article 5(1) mandates that personal data are: \n \n“(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’); \n \n(b)\tcollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed In a manner that is incompatible with those purposes… (‘purpose limitation’); \n \n(c)\tadequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’); \n \n(d)\taccurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’); \n \n(e)\tkept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed… (‘storage limitation’); \n \n(f)\tprocessed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing… (‘integrity and confidentiality’)” [my emphasis]. \n \n156.\tAs set out above, Article 5(1)(b) GDPR sets out the purpose limitation principle.  The language used - in particular, the references to data “collection” and “further processing” – is reflective of the language used in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as the introductory passage to Article 13 GDPR contains a reference to “collection”, and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR itself refers to “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended”.  It therefore can be said that Article 13 GDPR also considers “collection” and “further” processing.  For this reason, it is useful to examine further the requirements and function of the purpose limitation principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. \n \n157.\tThe Article 29 Working Party has also considered the purpose limitation principle.  In this regard, it has stated: \n \n“When setting out the requirement of compatibility, the Directive does not specifically refer to processing for the ‘originally specified purposes’ and processing for ‘purposes defined subsequently’. Rather, it differentiates between the very first processing operation, which is collection, and all other subsequent processing operations (including for instance the very first typical processing operation following collection – the storage of data). \n \nIn other words: any processing following collection, whether for the purposes initially specified or for any additional purposes, must be considered ‘further processing’ and must thus meet the requirement of compatibility”.  \n \n158.\tThe effect of this position is to create a distinction between “purpose specification” and “compatible use”.  In respect of “purpose specification”, the Article 29 Working Party stated that: \n  \n“[P]ersonal data should only be collected for ‘specified, explicit and legitimate’ purposes. Data are collected for certain aims; these aims are the ‘raison d’être’ of the processing operations. As a prerequisite for other data quality requirements, purpose specification will determine the relevant data to be collected, retention periods, and all other key aspects of how personal data will be processed for the chosen purpose/s”.  \n \n159.\tIn considering the interrelationship between the purpose limitation principle and other significant principles in the data protection framework, the Article 29 Working Group took the view that: \n \n“There is a strong connection between transparency and purpose specification. When the specified purpose is visible and shared with stakeholders such as data protection authorities and data subjects, safeguards can be fully effective. Transparency ensures predictability and enables user control”.  \n \n160.\tThe following position of the Article 29 Working Group is also relevant: \n \n“In terms of accountability, specification of the purpose in writing and production of adequate documentation will help to demonstrate that the controller has complied with the requirement of Article 6(1)(b). It would allow data subjects to exercise their rights more effectively – for example, it would provide proof of the original purpose and allow comparison with subsequent processing purposes”.  \n \n161.\tThe Article 29 Working Group also considered the benefits that transparency and accountability offered to data subjects, in particular, the fact that it enabled data subjects to make more informed choices.   In particular, it is worth noting that: \n \n“processing of personal data has an impact on individuals' fundamental rights in terms of privacy and data protection. This impact on the rights of individuals must necessarily be accompanied by a limitation of the use that can be made of the data, and therefore by a limitation of purpose. An erosion of the purpose limitation principle would consequently result in the erosion of all related data protection principles”[my emphasis].  \n \n162.\tAlthough I note that, strictly speaking, the guidance of the Article 29 Working Party is not binding on the Commission, it is nonetheless instructive in understanding the substance of the transparency obligations set out in the GDPR and their interrelationship with the core principles contained in Article 5 GDPR.  It is clear to me from the above that the purpose limitation principle has an important role to play, both in relation to the empowerment of the data subject, but also in relation to underpinning and supporting the objectives of the data protection framework as a whole under the GDPR. \n \n163.\tTherefore, when considering what information must be provided in respect of the “purposes” of any processing operation – for example, as required by Article 13(1)(c) - it seems clear to me that it is important to consider, among another things, how the quality of information provided may potentially impact the effective operation of the other data protection principles.  This is particularly the case where the wording of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR maps the approach of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, i.e. by describing the obligation arising by reference to “collection” and “further” processing. \n \n164.\tGiven that the data controller must identify the categories of personal data that will be collected so as to ensure compliance with the requirement to specify “purpose” in accordance with the purpose limitation principle, it is my view that data subjects must have access to the information required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR in conjunction with the category/categories of personal data being processed.  This is necessary to ensure that the data subject is empowered to hold the controller accountable for compliance with the purpose limitation principle set out in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.  This view is reflected in the Article 29 Working Party guidelines on transparency: \n \n“Transparency, when adhered to by data controllers, empowers data subjects to hold data controllers and processors accountable and to exercise control over their personal data by, for example, providing or withdrawing informed consent and actioning their data subject rights. The concept of transparency in the GDPR is user-centric rather than legalistic and is realised by way of specific practical requirements on data controllers and processors in a number of articles”.  \n \n\t \tMy View on the Information to be Provided \n \n165.\tIt was on the basis of the above analysis that I expressed the provisional view in the Preliminary Draft that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires that information which specifies and relates to the purpose(s) of the processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations for which the (specified category/categories of) personal data are intended is to be provided to data subjects.  It was also my provisional view that this information should be provided in such a way as to ensure that there is a clear link from: \n \na.\tthe specified category/categories of personal data to \nb.\tthe purpose(s) of the specified processing operation(s)/set(s) of operations to \nc.\tthe legal basis which is being relied on to support the specified processing operation(s)/set(s) of operations. \n \n166.\tThe Complainant agreed with this approach and, in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, stated that “[w]ithout such linking, we would simply see generic lists of all data, all purposes and all legal bases under Article 6(1) GDPR without any indication of the relationships between them.”.  \n \n167.\tMeta Ireland disagreed with this proposed approach and asserted that it was only obliged to provide specific information on (1) the purposes for the processing it carries out and (2) the legal bases upon which it relies.   In essence, this amounts to a restatement of its position that it is only required to provide (discrete) information as to the purposes and legal basis of any processing.  Meta Ireland further alleged that my reference to “processing operations” was “extraneous” as “[b]oth the intended purpose and the legal basis are, conceptually, capable of being explained and understood without any reference to the practicalities of the processing operations which will be applied to the personal data”.   Moreover, it is Meta Ireland’s position that my approach does not further the objectives of the transparency obligations nor would it provide information in “a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form”.  \n \n168.\tAs is evident from the assessment below, my view is that the Data Policy and related material sometimes, on the contrary, demonstrate an oversupply of very high level, generalised information at the expense of a more concise and meaningful delivery of the essential information necessary for the data subject to understand the processing being undertaken and to exercise his/her rights in a meaningful way. Furthermore, while Meta Ireland has chosen to provide its transparency information by way of pieces of text, there are other options available, such as the possible incorporation of tables, which might enable Meta Ireland to provide the information required in a clear and concise manner, particularly in the case of an information requirement comprising a number of linked elements.  The importance of concision cannot nonetheless be overstated.  It is, I think, important to emphasise that while a controller may provide (additional) information which goes beyond what is required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, that controller must first satisfy the information obligations set out in the GDPR and, second, ensure that any such additional information does not have the effect of creating information fatigue or otherwise diluting the effective delivery of the statutorily required information.   \n \n169.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I noted that while Article 13 GDPR – unlike Article 14 – does not expressly refer to categories of data, it does not follow that there is no obligation to provide information as to the category/categories of personal data undergoing processing.  Indeed, I expressed the view that information as to the categories of personal data must also be provided in ensuring compliance with Article 13 GDPR.  Meta Ireland disagreed and asserted that as Article 13 – unlike Article 14 – did not expressly refer to “categories of personal data and accordingly should not be read into Article 13(1)(c) GDPR”.193  In this vein, it was Meta Ireland’s position that as: \n \n“Article 14(1)(d) GDPR expressly requires a controller to provide information to the data subject on the categories of personal data (in circumstances where Article 14 applies) [it] further reinforces this point - i.e. it is clear from the fact that the concept is referred to in Article 14(1)(d) GDPR, that the legislators made a deliberate choice not to include this concept in Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. Indeed, if the Commission’s interpretation was correct there would have been no need for Article 14(1)(d) GDPR, as Article 14(1)(c) GDPR would in any event have to be approached on the basis that categories of data needed to be identified. As such, the Commission’s approach appears to conflict with the statutory interpretation principle expressio unis est exclusion alterius”.  \n \n170.\tI do not agree; rather, it remains my view that that there is an implicit obligation in Article 13 to provide such information.  In support of this position, it is important to first distinguish Article 13 from Article 14.  Article 13 concerns circumstances wherein personal data are collected (directly) from the data subject whereas Article 14 is applicable where the personal data have not been obtained from the data subject.  It logically follows that, as the data subject has provided the personal data to the controller, that data subject may already know the categories of personal data and the source of this information where the personal data is collected from that data subject.  However, it is not necessarily the case that, in such circumstances, the categories are known by the data subject, in particular where metadata or device data is collected from them.  Nonetheless, where personal data are not obtained from the data subject, that data subject will likely never have knowledge of the categories of personal data.  \n \n171.\tIt appears to me to be clear that both Articles 13 and 14 GDPR envisage that, in all circumstances, the data subject will have information as to the categories of personal data undergoing processing.  As Article 14 GDPR concerns circumstances wherein the personal data has not been obtained by the data subject and thus the categories are likely to never be known by the data subject, it explicitly specifies that such information should be provided.  On the other hand, Article 13 does not include this as an explicit requirement as it may be the case that the data subject who has provided the data may already know this information.  In my view, this is the distinction between the provisions and the clear motivation of the legislator in including the reference to categories of information in Article 14 GDPR alone.   \n \n172.\tI would further add that the fundamental difference in how the personal data is collected gives rise to other variations in the information required to be provided.  For example, Article 13(2)(e) GDPR requires the controller to inform the data subject as to “whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data.”  Article 14 GDPR, on the other hand, contains no such requirement.  The rationale for this difference is clear.  When this information is provided prior to the collection of personal data, the data subject is empowered to exercise control over their personal data.  It avoids them being placed in a position where they provide personal data to the controller on a mistaken understanding as to either the necessity for its collection, or of the potential consequences of failure to provide it.  The provision of such information would have no purpose if provided to the data subject after the personal data has been collected, hence its omission from Article 14 GDPR. \n \n173.\tIt is also unclear why a data subject would only be entitled to information concerning the categories of personal data if the controller has acquired their personal data from another source.  It is further difficult to understand how such a difference in treatment, between two categories of data subject, could be consistent with the GDPR, particularly where the difference in treatment concerns a core data subject right.  If this were true, a data subject would only be entitled to this information if the personal data were obtained from a source other than themselves, but would not if it was obtained from them directly.  This entirely arbitrary distinction is inconsistent with the clear aims of the GDPR to provide a series of universal rights to all data subjects, grounded on the universal right to data protection in Article 8 of the Charter.  Therefore even if the interpretation advanced in the preceding paragraph were incorrect, Meta Ireland’s submissions would nonetheless not be supported by a purposive or systematic reading of the GDPR. \n \n174.\tAccordingly, I am of the view that Article 13(1)(c) GDPR requires data controllers to provide information concerning the individual purpose(s) and legal basis by reference to a specified category/categories of personal data.  This is supported by both a literal interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, which refers to the purposes for which the personal data are intended, and a more purposive interpretation as I have considered above.  When the purposes and legal basis for processing are identified, they must be identified by reference to the personal data being processed or, at a minimum, the broad personal data processing operations to which they relate.  The purposes and legal basis of processing personal data can only be understood by reference to the processing operations being undertaken.  In order for information in this regard to be meaningful, and to provide data subjects with meaningful information as to whether they wish to exercise data subject rights, data subjects must be provided with this information.  This goes to the essence of transparency in relation to the processing of personal data.  In providing information on “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing” for the purposes of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, the data controller must do so by reference to the personal data being processed or, at least, the broad personal data processing operations involved. \n \n175.\tFor completeness, I should note that a controller’s transparency obligations are particularly pertinent where Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is being relied on as a legal basis for the processing of personal data.  Indeed, in respect of the transparency requirements, I note that the EDPB Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR state “[i]n line with their transparency obligations, controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis is[,] … particularly … where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b)”.   I agree with the EDPB’s view that transparency obligations are particularly pertinent in this context so as to ensure that data subjects freely exercise their freedom to enter into contracts.  In this regard, I also note that the EDPB provides an example similar to the facts at issue, namely where “data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) when signing a contract or accepting terms of service”.  \n \nInformation provided by Meta Ireland in relation to Processing in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) \n \n176.\tIn considering the information which Meta Ireland provided to users of the Instagram service in respect of processing in accordance with Article 6(1)(b), the starting point is the Instagram Data Policy.  Section V of the Data Policy specifically concerns the legal basis of processing in connection with the Instagram service and is entitled “What is our legal basis for processing data?”  In Section V, Meta Ireland specifically sets out its position in respect of contractual necessity, stating: \n \n“We collect, use and share the data that we have in the ways described above: \n \n•\tas necessary to fulfill our Facebook Terms of Service or Instagram Terms of Use; … \n \nLearn more about these legal bases and how they relate to the ways in which we process data”. \n \nFor completeness, I note that both the Meta Ireland Terms of Service and the Instagram Terms of Use are accessible by hyperlink.  The clause which invites users to “learn more” also contains a hyperlink which directs users to an unnamed page which the Investigator termed the “Legal Basis Notice”.  For clarity, I will retain that description of the page.  This page is not specific to the Instagram service but applies across various Meta services.  According to the Legal Basis Notice: \n \n“For all people who have legal capacity to enter into an enforceable contract, we process data as necessary to perform our contracts with you (the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms, together, 'the Terms'). We describe the contractual services for which this data processing is necessary in the “Our Services” section of the Terms, and in the additional informational resources accessible from the Terms. The core data uses necessary to provide our contractual services are: \n \n•\tTo provide, personalize, and improve our Facebook Products; \n•\tTo promote safety, integrity, and security; \n•\tTo transfer, transmit, store, or process your data outside the EEA, including to within the United States and other countries; \n•\tTo communicate with you, for example, on Product-related issues; and \n•\tTo provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products. \n \nThese uses are explained in more detail in our Data Policy, under “How do we use this information?” and “How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?” and “How do the Facebook Companies work together?” We’ll use the data we have to provide these services; if you choose not to provide certain data, the quality of your experience using the Facebook Products may be impacted”.  \n \n177.\tAs with the Instagram Data Policy, the Legal Basis Notice contained hyperlinks to both the Facebook Terms of Service and the Instagram Terms of Use.  It follows that users were invited to receive further information from these hyperlinks.  As the Instagram Terms of Use stated that it is those Terms of Use which comprise the agreement between the user and Meta Ireland (then Facebook), the focus on my analysis is on the Instagram Terms of Use.  While I note and agree with the Investigator’s position that the Facebook Terms of Service do not concern Instagram,  I would add that the version of the Instagram Terms of Use at the date of the Complaint was not explicit as regards the non-applicability of the Facebook Terms of Service to the Instagram service.  This is in contrast with more recent versions of the Terms of Use which expressly state that “[w]hen you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service”.   While I accept on balance that a data subject is likely to understand that the Facebook Terms of Service were not applicable in this context, it nonetheless may have been unclear given the hyperlinks to the Facebook Terms of Service in the Data Policy and Legal Basis Notice; this in turn is relevant for my assessment of the form in which the information was provided. \n \n178.\tI also note that users were directed to the “Our Services” section of the Instagram Terms of Use.  \nWhile there is no section expressly titled “Our Services” in the Terms of Use, there is a section for “The Instagram Service”.  Taking a broad reading, it appears to me that this is likely the section that the Legal Notice Basis directs users to.  Nonetheless, it should be noted that this is not explicitly made clear and I agree with the Investigator’s view that “[w]hile it is perhaps possible to discern the controller’s intention in this sentence, the terminology used here is inaccurate, and could confuse the reader as to the correct source of relevant information”.200  “The Instagram Service” section of the Terms of Use provides the following information: \n \n“We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the \nInstagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we \nprovide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service): \n \n•\tOffering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share. \nPeople are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram. \n \n•\tFostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment. \nWe develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy [hyperlinked]. \n \n•\tDeveloping and using technologies that help us consistently serve our  growing community. \nOrganizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service. \n \n•\tProviding consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. \nInstagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy [hyperlinked])-in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.  \n \n•\tEnsuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service. \nTo provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates. \n \n•\tConnecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about. \nWe use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram. \n \n•\tResearch and innovation. \nWe use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the wellbeing of our community”. \n \n179. The Terms of Use also stated that providing the Instagram service “requires collecting and using your information” and, accordingly, directed users to the Data Policy for information as to how Meta Ireland “collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products [hyperlinked]“.  The Data Policy outlined how the information was used in Section II entitled “How do we use this information?”  It should be noted that the Legal Basis Notice also directs users towards this section of the Data Policy.  Section II provides the following information: \n \n“We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how: \n \nProvide, personalize and improve our Products. \nWe use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide where you have given your explicit consent); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features, content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the ads that you see. \n \n•\tInformation across Facebook Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product. \n•\tLocation-related information: We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend). \n•\tProduct research and development: We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features. Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create are data with special protections under EU law. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce facerecognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether we use this technology for you. \n•\tAds and other sponsored content: We use the information we have about you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.”. \n \nProvide measurement, analytics, and other business services. \nWe use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share information with these partners. \n \nPromote safety, integrity and security. \nWe use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and Instagram Security Tips. \n \nCommunicate with you. \nWe use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. \n \nResearch and innovate for social good. \nWe use the information we have to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and wellbeing. For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research programs”. \n \nFurther information is made available to users by way of hyperlinks throughout Section II of the Terms of Use. \n \n180.\tAs noted above, the Legal Basis Notice outlines the five core data uses which Meta Ireland considers necessary to provides its contractual services.  The Legal Basis Notice advises that additional information in respect of these uses can be found under the following sections of the Data Policy:  \n \n-\t“How do we use this information?” (as outlined above);  \n-\t“How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?”; and  - \t“How do the Facebook Companies work together?” \n \n181.\tSection IX of the Data Policy considers “How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?” and states that: \n \n“We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Information controlled by Facebook Ireland will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries”. \n \n182.\tSection IV of the Data Policy concerns “How do the Facebook Companies work together?” and it states: \n \n“Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.” \n \nFurther information as to the entities comprising the “Facebook Company” or “Facebook Company Products” is accessible by way of hyperlinks. \n \nWhether Meta Ireland Complies with Article 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR \n \n183.\tIn the preceding section of this Draft Decision, I have outlined the various sources and documents by which a data subject may obtain information as to the purposes of the processing and the legal basis of same.  This information is provided in the (i) Instagram Data Policy, (ii) Legal Basis Notice, (iii) Instagram Terms of Use and (iv) other relevant hyperlinked pages.  Moreover, the information in these sources is rather general in nature.  As a preliminary matter, I restate my position that the information should be considered holistically and not individually “layer-by-layer”.  Accordingly, I will assess the information provided in all such documents/sources.  Nonetheless, the precise means by which the information is accessible in respect of the Instagram service is disjointed and circular in nature.  For example, the Data Policy directs users to the Legal Basis Notice, which in turn direct users to both the Data Policy and Terms of Use.  Furthermore, as I have noted above, the language used in directing users is confusing and misleading in parts, in particular where it appears that the Facebook Terms of Service has been conflated with the Instagram Terms of Use (for example, users are directed to sections which only appear in the former and not the latter), despite the fact that the former is not applicable to the Instagram service.  \n \n184.\tIn its response to the Preliminary Draft, the Complainant agreed with my approach taken on this issue, and emphasised that “the most relevant change in Facebook’s position”, in the Complainant’s view, was the decision to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question and not consent, following the GDPR taking legal effect, which was contained in the last layer of information and not displayed more prominently.  \n \n185.\tOn the other hand, in its response to the Preliminary Draft which provisionally found that the information was provided in a disjointed manner and that the texts were variations of each other, Meta Ireland reaffirmed its position that it had provided the requisite information to data subjects in line with its construction of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR.   In particular, Meta Ireland’s view was that users were “clearly and prominently told that Meta Ireland relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR” and extensive information was provided in the Terms of Use, Data Policy and Legal Basis Notice.   Meta Ireland criticised my view on the basis that such overlap was necessary and inevitable and also highlighted its use of hyperlinks and summaries to make the information more accessible to users.   Indeed, Meta Ireland asserted that my proposed approach did not “appreciate the positive benefit to users of providing a range of easily accessible tools and explanations, supplemented by additional detail, with easily-navigable hyperlinks connecting those layers”  and precludes users from being overwhelmed with information.206  In this regard, Meta Ireland also asserted that it provided “user-facing information in as simple a manner as possible, and [Meta Ireland] has sought to ensure that it can be understood by the average user”.   I further note Meta \nIreland’s assertion that my proposed approach was “excessively prescriptive”.  \n \n186.\tFirst of all, while it remains the case that it is for Meta Ireland to provide accessible information that is clear and concise for users regardless of their “sophistication”, that does not detract from the core of the criticism that the disjointed information set out in generalised terms is divorced from specific processing operations.  It is not that the presence of variations of the same information in several documents is in itself non-compliant, but rather that it is not compliant when it amounts, in practice, to statements about services and objectives that are not linked to specified processing operations and which do not provide meaningful information to the data subject on the core issues identified in Article 13 GDPR. The fact that this disjointed information is generalised and does not contain the required information (as has been set out when I addressed the correct interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR), renders the information as a whole unhelpful and ultimately inconsistent with Article 13 GDPR. \n \n187.\tWhile I accept that the Legal Basis Notice provides some information as to the purposes and legal basis of processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, I am not satisfied that sufficient information is provided.  In particular, I emphasise that the Legal Basis Notice provides a short statement of the five “core data uses” using “summary bullet points”  and describes these using generalised language.  Furthermore, it does not link these core data uses with any specific and/or specified processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations.  While users are directed to specific sections of the Data Policy (i.e. sections on “How do we use this information?” and “How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?” and “How do the Facebook Companies work together?”), it does not appear to me that any substantial additional detail and/or information is provided.  It seems that these various sources largely recycle similar generalised information which focusses on reiterating the aims/goals of the Meta Platforms group in its data processing activities more broadly, such as personalisation, security, communication and product development etc.  I am not convinced that this necessarily provides sufficient detail as to the purposes and legal basis of the processing.  Indeed, it appears impossible to identify what processing operations will be carried out in order to fulfil the objectives that are repeated throughout these documents and the legal basis for such operations.  In the absence of such information, the user is left to guess as to what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of the specified lawful bases, in order to fulfil these objectives.  For the reasons set out above in relation to the correct interpretation of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, this is insufficient information. \n \n188.\tMore critical, however, is the fact that these various sources of information do not provide meaningful additional information on the various processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations relied on to provide these services.  This generalised, repetitive information, in combination with the circular manner in which the information is made accessible to users, has the effect that Meta Ireland’s approach lacks clarity and concision, which in turn means it is difficult for users to identify or have meaningful information as to the processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations that are or will be grounded on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or on other legal bases.  On this basis, it is my view that Meta Ireland has not provided meaningful information as to the processing operation(s) and/or set(s) of operations that occur in the context of the Instagram service, either on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or any other legal basis.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that it is impossible for the user to identify with any degree of specificity what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of the specified lawful bases, in order to fulfil these objectives.  While I note that some information is provided in respect of IP addresses and location information, this is prefaced by qualifiers including “such as” and “things like” which indicates that the information provided is illustrative rather than concrete in nature.  Accordingly, I consider that users have been deprived of meaningful information which creates further risks of significant confusion as to what legal basis will be relied upon to ground a specific processing operation or set(s) of operations.  It is on this basis that I am not satisfied that the Data Policy and Legal Basis Information Page satisfy the requirements of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR either individually or cumulatively.  Indeed, it could be said that there is a significant deficit of information made available to data subjects. \n \n189.\tIn assessing whether the information provided is transparent, it is necessary to consider the form in which the information is provided.  In particular, Article 12(1) GDPR requires information to be provided in a “concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.”  Meta Ireland have maintained the position that the “Data Policy is drafted in a way that is both comprehensive and easy-to-read for our users” and includes links to relevant information.   In further submissions, Meta Ireland reasserted its position that the information was sufficiently accessible and comprehensive and alleged that: \n \n“A reduction of information or removing convenient hyperlinks to relevant information would have the effect of reducing overall user understanding and control of the Instagram service to the detriment of users. Furthermore, it is Facebook Ireland’s view that the use of examples actually increases the ease of comprehension by contextualising information. … [A] controller is not prohibited from providing more than the information required by Article 13(1)(c) GDPR to data subjects. The fact that Facebook Ireland has chosen to do so should not be held against Facebook Ireland when assessing its compliance (as seems to be the case in this instance)”.  \n \nMeta Ireland also alleged that the various sources of information were designed in such a manner as to enable data subjects to access the information as she/he wished.  In this regard, Meta Ireland stated that “these documents also serve as a key central resource to which data subjects can quickly and easily return to find more specific information relevant to their needs”.   In addition, Meta Ireland asserted that it “makes appropriate use of a layered format and links and clear references within the Data Policy, including the Legal Basis Notice”.  \n \n190.\tWhile I accept that a controller has a certain degree of discretion as to the precise manner in which in the information is provided, I am not persuaded by Meta Ireland’s submissions that the form of information complied with Article 12(1) GDPR.  As I outlined above, the information was not provided in a concise manner but over the course of several documents which cross-reference each other in a circular manner.  As I have stated above, I do not dispute Meta Ireland‘s assertion that a layered approach may be an appropriate means by which to convey information for the purposes of discharging transparency obligations under the GDPR.   However, it does not follow that all layered approaches are compliant with those obligations.  Taking into account the circular, disjointed nature of the information provided by Meta Ireland and the generalised, high-level overview it provided, I am not satisfied that the information was clear and concise.  Moreover, I would add that the language used was not clear or easy to understand as it referred to abstract objectives and purposes without any connection to specific categories of personal data or processing operations being undertaken.   \n \n191.\tAt this juncture, I also note that I expressed a provisional view in the Preliminary Draft that the information was also misleading in that the Facebook Terms of Service appear to be conflated with \nthe Instagram Terms of Use as references to the former in the Legal Basis Notice arguably (incorrectly) implied that the Facebook Terms of Service were applicable in the context of the Instagram service.  In response, Meta Ireland stated that, in its view,: \n \n“no such implication arises, particularly considering the expression ‘Terms’ is explicitly defined in the Legal Basis Notice as referring to ‘the Meta Terms and Instagram Terms, together, 'the Terms’. The definition also provides the user with a link to the Terms of Use (as well as a link to the Meta Terms of Service), which clearly inform the user that ‘[t]he \nMeta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service’.”  \n \nWhile I note Meta Ireland’s position, I do not agree with this position on the basis that “and”, in contrast to “or” – when used as a connecting word – does not imply alternatives.  While Meta Ireland have stated that the data subject is informed via the Terms of Use that the Facebook Terms of Service did not apply, this is not, strictly speaking, correct.  Indeed, as I outlined above, there is no reference to the Meta (or Facebook as it was then) Terms of Service in the Terms of Use at the date of the Complaint.  It is only the more recent versions of the Terms of Use which expressly state that “[w]hen you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service”.   Indeed, in the Terms of Use applicable at the date of the Complaint, the clause read as follows: “[w]hen you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms”.217  I further add that data subjects were not informed in either the Legal Basis Notice or the Facebook Terms of Service that the latter did not apply in the context of the Instagram service.  Therefore, I remain of the view that the information was misleading in this manner at the time of the Complaint.  \n \n192.\tI am also concerned by the fact that the layered approach adopted by Meta Ireland crossreferenced the same small number of documents in a circular manner (e.g. the Data Policy referring the user to the Legal Basis Notice which in turn redirected the user back to the Data Policy) as opposed to presenting the user with additional and more detailed information to as to enable them to better understand the relevant processing.  In addition, the substance of the documents overlapped significantly – including, for example, the five core data uses in the Legal Basis Notice and “The Instagram Service” section of the Instagram Terms of Use.  Given the similarity of the content and the means by which it is presented, it is difficult to identify whether additional or more detailed information has been provided when a user moves between documents.  This lack of clarity is further affected by the lack of identification of specific processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations by Meta Ireland.  Indeed, the lack of a single composite text or clearly layered path does not enable data subjects to quickly and easily understand the full extent of processing operations that will take place as regards their personal data arising from their acceptance of the Terms of Use.  Given this ambiguity, I agree with the Complainant that there is a real risk that data subjects may be misled as to the legal basis and/or purpose(s) of the relevant processing operation(s) and/or set(s) of operations.  The alleged “forced consent” and the dispute surrounding the processing operations being carried out, and the legal bases underpinning them, are reflective of a broader lack of clarity as regards the link between the purposes of processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved. \n \n193.\tAs a final point, I note Meta Ireland’s submission that the Commission should refrain from considering Article 13(1)(c) until such time that the statutory appeal in respect of IN-18-2-2 concerning WhatsApp has been resolved.   Meta Ireland has not provided any legal basis or identified any authority for this submission.  As this submission has not been substantiated, there is no basis for which to take such approach. \n \nArticle 5(1)(a) GDPR – Principle of Transparency  \n \n194.\tArticle 5(1)(a) GDPR concerns the broader principle of transparency.  However, it is important to emphasise that, a finding of non-compliance with Articles 12 – 14 GDPR (or parts thereof) does not necessarily or automatically imply that there has been an infringement of Article 5(1)(a).  Nonetheless, there is a significant link between these principles.  Indeed, transparency is an expression of the principles of fairness and accountability under the GDPR.  In this regard, I note that transparency is an “overarching obligation under the GDPR”  and is a broader expression of transparency than the specific obligations provided for in Article 12 – 14 GDPR.  Accordingly, while non-compliance with Article 12 – 14 GDPR (or parts thereof) do not necessitate a finding of noncompliance with Article 5(1)(a), in certain circumstances it is appropriate to find that there has been an infringement of both the specific transparency obligations and the broader principles of transparency where the extent of non-compliance with the former is sufficiently extensive to amount to an overarching infringement of the transparency principle. \n \n195.\tIn the context of this  Decision, there was an assumption on the part of the Complainant that Meta Ireland – which had primarily relied on consent as its lawful basis for processing prior to the coming into effect of the GDPR on 25 May 2018 – was relying on GDPR consent, provided by the means of accepting the updated Terms of Use following the coming into effect of the GDPR, as its legal basis for processing in the context of the Instagram service.  This assumption was premised on the user engagement flow presented to users which provided them with a number of opportunities to consent before selecting the final “Agree to Terms” button.  \n \n196.\tWhile there is no particularised requirement under the GDPR to provide data subjects with information on an alteration of a legal basis, or to provide information in a particular part of any such user engagement flow, the lack of clarity on such a fundamental issue underlines the inherent lack of transparency in the information provided to the data subject.  As I noted above, Article 5(1)(a) links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of a controller by requiring that personal data shall be “processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”.   \n \n197.\tIn the Preliminary Draft, I expressed a provisional view that Meta Ireland had also infringed Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in the circumstances of this case.  Meta Ireland disagreed with this approach.   In particular, Meta Ireland submitted that (without prejudice to its position that there was no infringement of the transparency obligations in Articles 12 and 13) it does “not consider that the circumstances in issue can properly be characterised as ‘sufficiently extensive’ to demonstrate an infringement of the overarching principle of transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR”.   In support of this position, Meta Ireland noted the Commission’s statement that the act of acceptance clearly related to the Terms of Use (and not the provision of consent).   Meta Ireland also noted that, were Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to refer to additional obligations other than those set out in Articles 12 14, “it would be a more expansive principle, holistically encapsulating transparency, fairness and lawfulness… [and] would arguably be concerned with matters other than the technical question of whether prescribed items of information have been provided”.  \n \n198.\tIn this respect, I follow the EDPB’s interpretation of this matter which arose following the EDPB’s adoption of a binding decision (“the EDPB Decision”)  relating to IN 18-12-2, an inquiry conducted by the Commission into WhatsApp Ireland Limited’s compliance with Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR.  The EDPB Decision states as follows: \n \na.\t“The EDPB notes that the concept of transparency is not defined as such in the GDPR. However, Recital 39 GDPR provides some elements as to its meaning and effect in the context of processing personal data. As stated in the Transparency Guidelines, this concept in the GDPR “is user-centric rather than legalistic and is realised by way of specific practical requirements on data controllers and processors in a number of articles”  . The key provisions concretising the specific practical requirements of transparency are in Chapter III GDPR. However, there are other provisions that also realise the transparency principle, for example, Article 35 (data protection impact assessment) and Article 25 GDPR (data protection by design and by default), to ensure that data subjects are aware of the risks, rules and safeguards in relation to the processing, as stated in Recital 39 GDPR  .  \nb.\tThe EDPB also notes that transparency is an expression of the principle of fairness in relation to the processing of personal data and is also intrinsically linked to the principle of accountability under the GDPR  . In fact, as noted in the Transparency Guidelines, a central consideration of the principles of transparency and fairness is that “the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences of the processing entails” and should not be taken by surprise about the ways in which their personal data has been used  . \nc.\tThus, it is apparent that, under the GDPR, transparency is envisaged as an overarching concept that governs several provisions and specific obligations. As stated in the Transparency Guidelines, “[t]ransparency is an overarching obligation under the GDPR applying to three central areas: (1) the provision of information to data subjects related to fair processing; (2) how data controllers communicate with data subjects in relation to their rights under the GDPR; and (3) how data controllers facilitate the exercise by data subjects of their rights”  .  \nd.\tThis being said, it is important to differentiate between obligations stemming from the \nprinciple of transparency and the principle itself. The text of the GDPR makes this distinction, by enshrining transparency as one of the core principles under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR on the one hand, and assigning specific and concrete obligations linked to this principle, on the other one. The concretisation of a broad principle in specific rights and obligations is not a novelty in EU law. For example, with regard to the principle of effective judicial protection, that CJEU has stated that it is reaffirmed in the right to an effective remedy and to a fair hearing, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter  . Nonetheless, that does not imply that principles as such cannot be infringed. In fact, under the GDPR the infringement of the basic principles for processing is subject to the highest fines of up to 20.000.000€ or 4% of the annual turnover, as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR. \ne.\tOn the basis of the above considerations, the EDPB underlines that the principle of transparency is not circumscribed by the obligations under Articles 12-14 GDPR, although the latter are a concretisation of the former. Indeed, the principle of transparency is an overarching principle that not only reinforces other principles (i.e. fairness, accountability), but from which many other provisions of the GDPR derive. In addition, as stated above, Article 83(5) GDPR includes the possibility to find an infringement of transparency obligations independently from the infringement of transparency principle. Thus, the GDPR distinguishes the broader dimension of the principle from the more specific obligations. In other words, the transparency obligations do not define the full scope of the transparency principle.  \nf.\tThat being said, the EDPB is of the view that an infringement of the transparency obligations under Articles 12-14 GDPR can, depending on the circumstances of the case, amount to an infringement of the transparency principle. \n199.\tAs I have outlined in this Issue 3, the deficiencies in the transparency obligations affect and/or relate to all processing carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the Instagram service (notwithstanding that I have focussed on processing relating to behavioural advertising).  The deficiencies were such that the Named Data Subject was under the impression that the relevant processing (including the relevant processing operations and/or set of processing operations) was based on consent, as had been the case prior to the coming into effect of the GDPR.  As I have further outlined above, this impression and associated assumption was premised on the user engagement flow presented to users which provided them with a number of opportunities to consent before selecting the final “Agree to Terms” button.  I am of the view that these deficiencies amount to a significant level of non-compliance by Meta Ireland such that the Named Data Subject was under the impression that the relevant processing was based on consent and it is my view that the infringement with the transparency principle is sufficiently extensive to amount to an overarching infringement of the transparency. \n \nFinding 3: \nIn relation to processing for which Meta Ireland indicated reliance upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR have been infringed. \n \n \t  \n\t6 \tWHETHER META IRELAND INFRINGED THE ARTICLE 5(1)(A) PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS \n200.\tDuring the course of the Article 60 consultation period, the Italian SA raised an objection, requiring the amendment of the Draft Decision to include a finding of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.  The Commission decided not to follow the objection in circumstances where compliance with the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness was not examined during the course of this inquiry and, consequently, Meta Ireland was never afforded the opportunity to be heard in response to a particularised allegation of wrongdoing, as required by Irish and EU law.  Accordingly the Commission referred the objection to the EDPB for determination pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.  Having considered the matter, the EDPB determined as follows: \n \n220.\tIn accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR. The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it contains no finding of infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objection and its submissions. \n \n221.\tThe EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection lacks merit as it goes beyond the scope of the inquiry . The EDPB also notes that Meta IE links the issue of the potential infringement of the principle of fairness, raised in the IT SA objection, with the question of the competence of CSAs or the EDPB to assess the validity of contracts in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and, when responding to the merits of the IT SA objection, Meta IE refers to its submissions on application of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR with respect to standard form contracts . While taking note of Meta IE’s view on this matter, the EDPB considers the question of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be distinct from the question of the choice of the appropriate legal basis (although a connected one, as explained below) and proceeds with its respective assessment below. \n \n222.\tFirstly, the EDPB recalls that the basic principles relating to processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as such, be infringed . This is apparent from the text of Article 83(5)(a) GDPR which subjects the infringement of the basic principles for processing to administrative fines of up to 20 million euros, or in the case of undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. \n \n223.\tThe EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Article 6(2) and Article 6(3)(b) GDPR refer to lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing. \n \n224.\tOn the basis of the above consideration, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s view that \n“Article 5(1)(a) links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of a controller”  but \n\nconsiders that the principle of fairness has an independent meaning and stresses that an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of transparency does not automatically rule out the need for an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness too.  \n \n225.\tThe EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights . The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect of the principle of fairness in the context of processing personal data. For example, the EDPB has previously opined in its Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “[f]airness is an overarching principle which requires that personal data should not be processed in a way that is unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject” . \n \n226.\tAmong the key fairness elements that controllers should consider in this regard, the EDPB has mentioned autonomy of the data subjects, data subjects’ expectation, power balance, avoidance of deception, ethical and truthful processing . These elements are particularly relevant in the case at hand. The principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR underpins the entire data protection framework and seeks to address power asymmetries between the data controllers and the data subjects in order to cancel out the negative effects of such asymmetries and ensure the effective exercise of the data subjects’ rights. The EDPB has previously explained that “the principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller” \n. \n \n227.\tThe EDPB recalls that a fair balance must be struck between, on the one hand, the commercial interests of the controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of the data subjects under the GDPR . A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR refers to pursuing “power balance” as a “key objective of the controller-data subject relationship” , especially in the context of online services provided without monetary payment, where users are often not aware of the ways and extent to which their personal data is being processed . Consequently, lack of transparency can make it almost impossible in practice for the data subjects to exercise an informed choice over the use of their data   which is in contrast with the element of “autonomy” of data subjects as to the processing of their personal data . \n \n228.\tConsidering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is particularly important to ensure that data subjects are protected from any form of abuse and deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into account the particular service that is being provided and the characteristics of their users, serves as a shield from the danger of abuse and deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries. \n \n229.\tThe EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to the principles of fairness and purpose limitation . In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users via the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, compliance with the \n\nprinciple of fairness also relates to “how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with its social networking service” . Thus the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness requires also an assessment of the consequences that the choice and presentation of the legal basis entail for the users of the Instagram service. In addition, that assessment cannot be made in the abstract, but has to take into account the specificities of the particular social networking service and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising \n. \n \n230.\tThe EDPB notes that in this particular case the breach of Meta IE’s transparency obligations is of such gravity that it clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of the Instagram users by confusing them on whether clicking the “Agree to Terms” button results in giving their consent to the processing of their personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance with the principle of fairness is avoiding deception i.e. providing information “in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design” . \n \n231.\tAs outlined in the Draft Decision, the Complainant argues that Meta IE relied on “forced consent” as a result of being led to believe that the legal basis for processing the controller was relying upon was consent . The Complaint demonstrates the confusion suffered by the Complainant both due to the (lack of) information presented to Instagram users in the context of their “agreement”  and the circumstances of how the act of “agreement” was sought by Meta IE . The EDPB considers that the LSA should have taken into account such Meta IE’s practices in relation to the principle of fairness, regardless of its finding that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use . \n \n232.\tIn addition, and as recognised by the LSA itself, further to its assessment of the information provided concerning processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “it is impossible for the user to identify with any degree of specificity what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of the specified lawful bases” . Considering this, in the EDPB’s view, there are clear indications that Instagram users’ expectations with regard to the applicable legal basis have not been fulfilled . Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Instagram users are left “in the dark”  and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful  because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, which ultimately restricts the Instagram users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights. \n \n233.\tFurthermore, the EDPB considers that the extensive analysis by the IE SA with regard to the issue of legal basis and transparency in relation to the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is closely linked to the issue of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness. Considering the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Instagram users in a misleading manner , which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that the IE SA’s finding of breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to the principle of transparency  should extend to the principle of fairness too. \n \n234.\tThis is all the more supported by the fact that, in the circumstances of the present case as demonstrated above , the overall effect of the infringements by Meta IE of the transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  further intensifies the imbalanced nature of the relationship between Meta IE and the Instagram users brought up by the IT SA objection. The combination of factors, such as the asymmetry of the information created by Meta IE with regard to the Instagram service users, combined with the “take it or leave it” situation that they are faced with due to the lack of alternative services in the market and the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular processing under the contract with Meta IE, systematically disadvantages the Instagram service users, limits their control over the processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under Chapter III of the GDPR. \n \n235.\tTherefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include a finding of an infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE, in addition to the infringement of the principle of transparency under the same provision, and to adopt the appropriate corrective measures, by addressing, but without being limited to, the question of an administrative fine for this infringement as provided for in Section 9 of this Binding Decision. \n \n201.\tAccordingly, and as directed by the EDPB further to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Meta Ireland has infringed the principle of fairness pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. \n \nFinding 4:  \nMeta Ireland has infringed the principle of fairness pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. \n \t \n \n\t7 \tSUMMARY OF FINDINGS \n \n \nISSUE \t \nFINDING  \n \nReliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the Legal Basis for processing for the purposes of behavioural advertising in respect of the Instagram service. \t \nI find that Meta Ireland infringed Article 6(1) GDPR when it relied when it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of its offering of Terms of Use. \n \n \nWhether Meta Ireland failed to provide necessary information regarding its legal basis for processing pursuant to acceptance of the Terms of Use and whether the information set out was set out in a transparent manner \n \t \nI find that Meta Ireland has infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  \nAs raised by the Italian SA by way of its objection, whether Meta Ireland infringed the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness in the context of its approach to the provision of information as part of the presentation of its Terms of Use to the Complainant. \n \tAs directed by the EDPB pursuant to the Article 65 Decision, I find that Meta Ireland has infringed the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness. \n \n \n\t8 \tDECISION ON CORRECTIVE POWERS \n202.\tI have set out above in sections 3 to 6, pursuant to Section 111(1)(a) of the 2018 Act, the findings set out above (recording my views and those of the EDPB by way of the Article 65 Decision)  that Meta Ireland has infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  As required by the EDPB pursuant to the Article 65 Decision, I have also found that Meta Ireland has infringed Article 6(1) GDPR as well as the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness. \n \n203.\tUnder Section 111(2) of the 2018 Act, where the Commission makes a decision (in accordance with Section 111(1)(a)), it must, in addition, make a decision as to whether a corrective power should be exercised in respect of the controller or processor concerned and, if so, the corrective power to be exercised.  For the reasons set out above and those I will outline below, my view is that corrective measures should be exercised. \n \n9. ORDER TO BRING PROCESSING INTO COMPLIANCE \n205.\tArticle 58(2) GDPR sets out the corrective powers which supervisory authorities may employ in respect of non-compliance of the GDPR by a controller or processor. \n \n206.\tMy view is that the corrective power provided for in Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, i.e. an order to bring processing into compliance (the “Order”), should be imposed.  This order would, firstly, require Meta Ireland to bring the Instagram Data Policy and Terms of Use into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards information provided on: (i) data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as well as (ii) data processed for the purpose of behavioural advertising in context of the Instagram service, in accordance with the principles set out in this Decision.  Meta Ireland has argued that it is neither necessary nor proportionate to make this order.  For the reasons set out above and below, I have concluded that it is necessary and proportionate to do so. \n \n207.\tIt was proposed in the Preliminary Draft that this should be done within three months of the date of notification of any final decision.  Meta Ireland was of the view that this was not a reasonable period of time within which to make the necessary changes, as the changes would be resourceintensive and would require “sufficient lead in time for preparing, drafting, designing and engineering the relevant changes, conducting and taking account of user testing of the proposed changes, internal cross-functional engagement as well as of course engagement with the Commission, and localisation and translation of the information for countries in the European Region”.232 \n \n208.\tIn this respect, I emphasise that Meta Ireland is a large multinational organisation with significant financial, technological and human resources at its disposal.  Moreover, the interim period, prior to any such rectification to the current lack of information being provided to data subjects, will involve a serious ongoing deprivation of their rights (as outlined below in Section 10).  Moreover, the Commission has provided specific analysis to Meta Ireland in relation to the correct interpretation of the provisions in question and the requisite information that is absent from the relevant user-facing documents.  This specificity should negate any need for extensive engagement with the Commission during the period of implementation, and provides clarity for Meta Ireland as to what objective its very significant resources should be directed towards in order to comply with this order.  As such, I am not satisfied that it would be impossible or indeed disproportionate to make an order in these terms, having regard to the importance of the data subject rights involved, the specificity of the order and Meta Ireland’s resources. \n \n209.\tI therefore order that the Terms of Use and Data Policy be brought into compliance within three months commencing on the day following the date of service of the Commission’s final decision. \n \n210.\tI consider that this order is necessary to ensure that full effect is given to Meta Ireland’s obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), and 13(1)(c) GDPR in light of the infringements outlined above.  The substance of this proposed order is the only way in which the defects pointed out in this Decision can be rectified, which is essential to the protecting of the rights of data subjects.  It is on this basis that I am of the view that this power should be exercised.  I note Meta Ireland’s disagreement with this position on the basis that it is already voluntarily attempting to alter the documents to express the views set out in the Preliminary Draft, and would therefore like to continue using “less onerous means” to ensure compliance.  \n \n211.\tHaving regard to the non-compliance in this Decision, in my view, such an order is proportionate and is the minimum order required in order to guarantee that compliance will take place in the future.  The fact that Meta Ireland is already taking steps to bring its information into compliance suggest that there would be nothing practically onerous about an order to carry out something that Meta Ireland already intends to carry out.  On that basis, I see nothing in these arguments to suggest a lack of proportionality arises in relation to such an order.  \n \n212.\tAs instructed by the EDPB, in paragraph 290 of the Article 65 Decision, this Order would, secondly, require Meta Ireland to take the necessary action to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising (“the Processing”), in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use, into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR in accordance with the conclusion reached by the EDPB, as recorded at paragraph 137 of the Article 65 Decision within a period of three months, commencing on the day following the date of service of the Commission’s final decision.  More specifically, in this regard, Meta Ireland is required to take the necessary action to address the EDPB’s finding that Meta Ireland is not entitled to carry out the Processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, taking into account the analysis and views expressed by the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 of the Article 65 Decision.  Such action may include, but is not limited to, the identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis, in Article 6(1) GDPR, for the Processing together with the implementation of any necessary measures, as might be required to satisfy the conditionality associated with that/those alternative legal basis/bases. \n \n213.\tIn its Final Submissions, Meta Ireland submitted as follows: \n \na.\tFirstly234, in relation to the matters covered by the term “the Processing” (as defined in paragraph 212, above, it understood the Commission to refer “specifically to the processing for the purpose of behavioural advertising carried out by Meta Ireland to-date on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use as considered in the Inquiry.”  Meta Ireland noted that, as previously explained in its Article 65 Submissions, it carries out certain other types of processing for behavioural advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.  For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm Meta Ireland’s understanding as to the processing covered by the second limb of the above Order.  The term “the Processing”, as defined in paragraph 212, above, means any processing for behavioural advertising purposes which was previously carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. \n \nb.\tSecondly, Meta Ireland has submitted  that the Commission has discretion as regards the date of commencement of the compliance period that, as noted above, was determined by the EDPB.  In this regard, Meta Ireland noted that the Article 65 Decision does not require the Commission to provide that the Order must take effect “on the day following the date of service of the [Commission’s] final decision”, as suggested.  Furthermore, Meta Ireland has submitted  that the timeline for compliance, as regards the action required to be taken pursuant to both limbs of the Order, should run consecutively rather than concurrently.  \n \nc.\tIn support of the above submissions, Meta Ireland has estimated that it “will take at least   to implement both compliance orders” by reference to the work that will be required to give effect to the terms of the Order.  This work includes (but is not limited to)  \n \n \n.  Meta Ireland has further identified that, once this \nwork is completed, it will then need to develop and/or update user-facing materials, to the extent needed to explain these changes to users, including updates to the Data Policy and other transparency notices. \n \nd.\tMeta Ireland has further submitted that, if the Order is made in the terms proposed, this would require it to dedicate its resources to attempting to comply with the Order immediately and “certainly before the period within which Meta Ireland is entitled to appeal from the final decision has elapsed.”  This, according to Meta Ireland, would seriously “impair and prejudice” its right to an effective appeal. \n \n214.\tHaving considered the above matters in light of the Article 65 Decision, I do not agree with Meta Ireland’s submission that the Commission has discretion to delay the activation of any aspect of the Order.  It is clear, from paragraph 290 of the Article 65 Decision that the EDPB considered it necessary for Meta Ireland to take the remedial action required to address the relevant infringements “within three months”.  While Meta Ireland has correctly identified that the EDPB has not expressly identified the starting point, the Commission’s view is that it goes without saying that the starting point has to be the adoption and notification of the Commission’s final decision, given that this is the earliest date on which the applicable timeline for compliance can start to run.  \nAny contrary suggestion would be inconsistent with the need for urgent action that was clearly indicated to be required in paragraphs 288, 290, 291 of the Article 65 Decision.  It would further render meaningless the EDPB’s consideration of the compliance period in terms of a fixed number of months (in this case, three). \n \n215.\tInsofar as Meta Ireland appears to consider it significant that the Commission itself amended the terms of the existing Order such that the timeline for compliance is now stated to run from the day following the date of service of the Commission’s final decision, the Commission does not consider this to be a material amendment of the existing text.  The Commission considered it necessary to add this clarification to address a position whereby there might be any delay between the date of adoption of this Decision and the date on which this Decision is formally notified to/served upon Meta Ireland (as has occurred in at least one previous inquiry).  The clarification ensures legal certainty, as regards the timelines associated with the Order and Meta Ireland’s right to a judicial remedy. \n \n216.\tFinally, as regards the resources that Meta Ireland will need to devote to the matters covered by the terms of the Order, I note that I have already had regard to the significant financial, technological and human resources at Meta Ireland’s disposal.  Furthermore, I do not agree that Meta Ireland will need to await the outcome of its efforts to achieve compliance with the second limb of the Order before it might address the first limb.  I note, in this regard, that the first limb of the Order was present in the Draft Decision (dated 1 April 2022).  Meta Ireland was already aware of the likelihood that it would have to take action to address the shortcomings identified as part of the analysis that underpinned the findings of infringement of the transparency provisions (namely Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR).  In the circumstances, Meta Ireland has already had time to begin the groundwork required to achieve compliance with its transparency obligations. \n \n217.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, I am not persuaded by Meta Ireland’s submission that envisaged date of commencement of the timeline for compliance would “seriously impair and prejudice” its right to an effective appeal.  I note, in this regard, that Meta Ireland has not explained how such a risk would arise from the timely implementation of the deadline for compliance with the Order.  I further note that matters pertaining to the possible filing of any appeal will likely be dealt with by Meta Ireland’s internal and external legal advisors as opposed to the “stakeholders” whose input will be required as part of Meta Ireland’s efforts to achieve compliance with the terms of the Order.  While I anticipate that there will, of course, be overlap in terms of the resources that might need to devote time to both the required remedial action and matters pertaining to the possible filing of any appeal, I do not envisage how such overlap would be anywhere near total such as to give rise to a risk to Meta Ireland’s ability to exercise its right to an effective appeal.  I further note that the compliance deadline extends beyond the limitation periods prescribed for any application for judicial redress under Irish law.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that Meta Ireland’s right to pursue judicial redress will not be impaired by the compliance periods outlined above. \n \n10. ADMINISTRATIVE FINE \n218.\tIn accordance with Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, I am permitted to consider the imposition of an administrative fine, pursuant to Article 83 GDPR, “in addition to, or instead of” the other measures outlined in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case.  Section 115 of the 2018 Act also provides for this as it permits the Commission to impose an administrative fine on its own or in combination with any other corrective power specified in Article 58(2) GDPR.  I am therefore satisfied that I am permitted to impose an administrative fine in addition to a compliance order.   \n \n219.\tHowever, in this regard, I emphasise that I am guided by Article 83(1) GDPR which provides that the imposition of fines “shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive”. I further note that, in making the decision as to whether to impose an administrative fine or indeed the amount of any such fine, I am obliged by Article 83(2) GDPR to have “due regard” to the eleven criteria set out in Article 83(2).  I have considered each of these criteria and presented my corresponding assessment below.  In response to Meta Ireland’s submission that the impact of each of the criteria in Article 83(2) was insufficiently clear,  I have specified whether I consider each relevant factor to be aggravating, mitigating or neither. \n \n220.\tI note, at this juncture, that Meta Ireland disagreed that an administrative fine – and indeed, the amount I have proposed  - would be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in this context.239  I further note Meta Ireland’s position that a reprimand would be more appropriate in this instance.240  I will address the arguments it has presented in the course of considering the criteria set out in Article 83(2) GDPR. \n \n221.\tIn the Draft Decision, I considered the imposition of an administrative fine in relation to the finding of infringement identified at Finding 3 above, namely the finding of infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of Meta Ireland’s approach to transparency.  Following the circulation of the Draft Decision to the supervisory authorities concerned for the purpose of enabling them to share their views, in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections to the proposed administrative fines were raised by the supervisory authorities of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway.  Having considered those objections, the EDPB determined as follows: \n \n\"344. The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fine . A fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, as required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the case . In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. \n \n345.\tThe EDPB responds to Meta IE’s argument that the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above (see Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 277 -279 as well as footnote 624). \n \n346.\tThe finding in the Draft Decision of a transparency infringement for the processing concerned still stands. The EDPB recalls that, on substance, no objections were raised on this finding. Meta IE infringed its general transparency obligations by being unclear on the link between the purposes of processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved , irrespective of the validity of the legal basis relied on for the ‘processing concerned’. It remains the case that, for the transparency infringements, ‘‘the processing concerned’’ should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that Meta IE carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which Meta IE indicated it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR , including for the purposes of behavioural advertising. This is without prejudice to the fact that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising as part of the delivery of its Instagram service under the Terms of Use. Whether or not Meta IE appropriately chose its legal basis for processing, the transparency infringement as assessed in the Draft Decision still stands. Therefore, the IE SA must not modify this description retro-actively in light of the assessment of the validity of the legal basis, including for the purpose of carrying out any reassessment of the administrative fines originally proposed by the Draft Decision, as might be required by this Binding Decision. \n \n347.\tIn light of the objections found relevant and reasoned, the EDPB addresses whether the Draft Decision proposes a fine for the transparency infringements that is in accordance with the criteria established by Article 83(2) GDPR and the criteria provided for by Article 83(1) GDPR. In doing this, the EDPB will first assess the disputes arisen in respect of the analysis of specific criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR performed by the LSA, and then examine whether the proposed fine meets the requirements of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality set in Article 83(1) GDPR, including by affording adequate weight to the relevant factors and to the circumstances of the case. \n \nOn any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR) \n \n348.\tArticle 83(2)(e) GDPR requires supervisory authorities to give due regard to any previous relevant infringement of the GDPR by the controller or processor as one of the circumstances that justifies an increase in the basic amount of the fine. As similar reference can be found in Recital 148 GDPR. \n \n349.\tFor the purposes of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, both previous infringements of the same subject matter and infringements of a different subject matter but committed in a manner similar to that under investigation, should be considered as relevant. Furthermore, the EDPB recalls that the scope of assessment of infringements may include not only previous decisions by the investigating supervisory authority, but also infringements found by other authorities, provided that they are relevant to the case under investigation . \n \n350.\tThe EDPB first notes that, contrary to Meta IE’s views , substantial similarities exist in the infringements found by the LSA in its draft decision and in its decision IN-18-12-2 in relation to WhatsApp Ireland Limited and in which breach of GDPR obligations were established. As rightly pointed out by the IT SA, the LSA indeed considered in both decisions that the controller had not provided transparent information on the legal basis and purposes of the processing operations or sets of processing operations carried out, thereby infringing Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR . \n \n351.\tThe IT SA contends that, to the extent that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are part of the same corporate group, the previous decision concerning WhatsApp Ireland Limited “sets a key precedent in assessing a controller’s repetitive conduct”, as “not only did the controller in question clearly stick to the same business model in offering its different social networking services, it also did not change its assessment as to how to manage users’ data with particular regard to its information and transparency obligations”  The IE SA disagrees with this objection, considering that Article 83(2)(e) GDPR cannot apply in the circumstances of this case insofar as its decision against WhatsApp Ireland Limited was addressed to a different controller . \n \n352.\tIn this respect, the EDPB notes that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are both subsidiaries of Meta Platforms, Inc. . Nonetheless, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR draws a distinction between on the one hand the “controller” or “processor” , which are responsible for complying with the rules of the GDPR, and on the other hand the “undertaking”  to which the controller or processor is part of, and that may be found jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine253. In this context, Article 83(2)(e) GDPR explicitly refers to the need to consider previous relevant infringements committed ‘’by the controller or processor’’ (emphasis added). \n \n353.\tTherefore, the EDPB considers that the Final Decision does not need to refer to the infringements by WhatsApp Ireland Limited, as established in Decision IN-18-12-2, as an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(e) GDPR for the calculation of the fine. \n \nThe effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness of the administrative fine (Article 83(1) GDPR) \n \n354.\tWith regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour, or both254. In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again)255. Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages both the controller or processor concerned as well as other controllers or processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct. Proportionality of the fine needs also to be ensured as the measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective256. In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s views that there is no basis to conclude that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive effect257. \n \n355.\tThe EDPB reiterates that it is incumbent upon the supervisory authorities to verify whether the amount of the envisaged fines meets the requirements of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple infringements, increases and decreases for aggravating and mitigating circumstances and financial/socio-economic circumstances258. Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is \n                                               \nsettled case-law of the CJEU, the term ‘undertaking’ “encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed’’ (see, in this regard, EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 292).   \n253\tEDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 290.   \n254\tEDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, p. 6.   \n255\tSee, inter alia, C-511/11, Versalis, paragraph94.   \n256\tSee Judgement of the General Court of 14 October 2021, MT v Landespolizeidirektion Steiermark, C-231/20, , ECLI:EU:C:2021:845, paragraph45 (“the severity of the penalties imposed must […] be commensurate with the seriousness of the infringements for which they are imposed, in particular by ensuring a genuinely deterrent effect, while not going beyond what is necessary to attain that objective”).   \n257\tMeta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs, 2.22, 5.16, 7.16, 8.30 and 9.23.   \n258\tEDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraph 132, and EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, p. 6, specifying that ”administrative fines should adequately respond to the nature, gravity and consequences of the breach, and supervisory authorities must assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified”.   \nnot an arithmetically precise exercise , and supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in this respect . \n \n356.\tThe DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs , object to the level of the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision as they consider the proposed fine not effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR) . \n \n357.\tThese CSAs argue that the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR are not weighed correctly by the LSA when calculating the administrative fines in the present case, in light of the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR . Specifically, the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs argue that the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision is not proportionate with IE SA’s findings in relation to the nature and seriousness of the infringements and the number of data subjects concerned .  \n \n358.\tIn addition, these CSAs argue that the fine is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive taking into account the financial position of Meta Platform, Inc. .  \n \n359.\tThe EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s disagreement with the fine proposed by the IE SA  and their view that the LSA already considers all factors it considered to be relevant to Article 83(2) GDPR and that ‘’none of the CSAs have created any reasonable doubt as to the validity of the DPC’s calculation’’ .  \n \n360.\tThe EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA indicates being satisfied the proposed fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive, taking into account all the circumstances of the IE SA’s inquiry . The IE SA assessed the different criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR in relation to the transparency infringements found . The IE SA considered the infringements as serious in nature , and in terms of gravity of the infringements found a significant level of non-compliance . Furthermore, the EDPB underlines that, as established by the IE SA, the infringements affect a significant number of data subjects  and are extensive . The EDPB also observes that the IE SA considered the negligent character of the infringement , as well as the high level of responsibility of Meta IE for the lack of compliance with the GDPR  as aggravating factors under Article 83(2) GDPR. Further, the IE SA qualified the level of damage suffered by data subjects as significant . In addition, the IE SA identified only one mitigating factor, without indicating, however, whether this should lead to a slight or substantial reduction of the fine range276.  \n \n361.\tMeta IE argues that reputation costs should also be taken into consideration, citing the IE SA’s remark on “the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract” . On principle, the EDPB agrees that reputation costs could be taken into consideration to some extent, if credible arguments are put forward about the grave detriment that would ensue. Meta IE does not present such arguments . The EDPB is of the view that in this case other incentives would offset any reputational costs. As far as advertisers are concerned, Meta IE puts forward that “The personalised nature of the Instagram Service is also the reason why it has been instrumental in the success of small and medium sized businesses (“SMBs”) worldwide, including across the EU. Personalisation on social media and other digital technologies, including the Instagram Service, enables SMBs to compete for customers through “customizing [sic] products and services, [...] building a unique brand image, tailoring marketing to a specific audience and developing a strong one-to-one connection with a community of customers’’  . As far as users of the Instagram service are concerned, there are network effects at play which leads to incentives to join - or not leave - the platform, so as not to be excluded from participating in discussions, corresponding with and receiving information from others .  \n \n362.\tAccording to the DE, FR, and IT SAs, the proposed fine is not consistent with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited for the same transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR) . \nIn particular, the DE SAs point out that ‘’the facts and the seriousness of the infringements in the two cases are no sufficiently different to justify a difference of 85% in the fine imposed’’ . The FR and IT SAs also compare with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR) . While the EDPB agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR , the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the DE, FR and IT SAs do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regards to the nature and gravity of the infringements involved . Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter.  \n \n363.\tThe DE, FR, IT and NO SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine range is about \n0.03 %  of the global annual turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc., which the DE SAs note is about 0.72% of the maximum ceiling provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR . For illustrative purposes also, is the amount of time it would take Meta Platforms, Inc. on average to generate 23 million euros in turnover in 2020, which was about 2 hours and 33 minutes .  \n \n364.\tThe EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect . The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business . As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model , the risk of this occurring is all the greater292. By bearing the cost of the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment.  \n \n365.\tThough the IE SA touches upon the notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in relation to the proposed fine , there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to explain the modest fine range chosen. Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR , the IE SA does not articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness . In this regard the EDPB recalls that, contrary to Meta IE’s views , the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR . The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine.  \n \n366.\tIn light of the above, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.”  \n \n \n222.\tI have taken account of the above directions of the EDPB in the Article 83(2) assessments set out below. \n \n223.\tAs noted above, the EDPB, by way of the Article 65 Decision, has also directed me to find that Articles 6(1) and the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness have also been infringed.  Pursuant to those determinations, the EDPB made further directions, as regards the imposition of additional administrative fines.  In relation to the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB directed, first, at paragraph 440 of the Article 65 Decision, as follows: \n \n“Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an additional administrative fine”. \n \n \n224.\tAt paragraph 468, the EDPB further directed that: \n \n“The EDPB instructs the IE SA to cover the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR with an administrative fine which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR.”  \n \n225.\tAs regards the manner in which I should assess the new infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB instructed as follows: \n \n410.\tThe EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one. In the case at hand, however, the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in their objections. The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection. \n \n411.\tSeveral of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. \n \nThe nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) \n \n412.\tAs mentioned above and outlined below, the nature and gravity of the infringement clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine. \n \n413.\tWith respect to the scope of processing, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that “Meta Ireland processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a ‘personalised’ experience, including by way of serving  personalised advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered [...]’’. \n  \n414.\tIn this respect, the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal data of a significant number of people  \n \n415.\tThough the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that data subjects have been faced with data processing that should not have occurred (by relying inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis as established in Section 4.4.2). The data processing in question - behavioural advertising - entails decisions about information that data subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, \n\na risk of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself and that the impact on them has to be considered.  \n \nThe intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)  \n \n416.\tThe SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be considered intentional on Meta IE’s part, which is an aggravating factor.  \n \n417.\tThe EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the aim to infringe the GDPR, nor was negligent - but “has relied on what it has consistently considered in good faith to be a valid legal basis for the purpose of processing of personal data for behavioural advertising and which now requires escalation to the EDPB for resolution”. Before addressing each of the elements of this claim, the EDPB first notes that establishing either intent or negligence is not a requirement for imposing a fine, but deserves “due regard”. Second, contrary to what Meta IE implies, the mere circumstance that a dispute between the LSA and the CSAs has escalated to the EDPB does not serve as evidence that a controller acted in good faith with respect to the disputed issues. First, the dispute arises only (long) after the controller has decided on its course of action, and therefore cannot inform it. Second, a dispute may simply bring to light that an LSA has decided to challenge a position commonly held by (a majority of) the CSAs.  \n \n418.\tThe EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the willfulness in relation to such act. By contrast, an infringement is “unintentional” when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement.  \n \n419.\tThe characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis of objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case. It is worth noting the broad approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain degree of knowledge about a potential infringement. This provides an indication that noncompliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence. \n \n420.\tThe SE SA argues that Meta IE “has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the aforementioned [EDPB Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] – which clearly gives doubt to the legality of the processing – which were first adopted on 9 April 2019 and made final on 8 October 2019. The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date”. \n \n421.\tThe EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive - is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application. Second, WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing \n\nis necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”. \n \n422.\tIt stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated.  \n \n423.\tThe EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the “will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the “wilfulness” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality. While it may prove difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality. \n \n424.\tThe EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”, rather than “intentionality” when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation”. In this regard, while the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place for the safeguard of personal data, this does not, however, per se change the nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional.  \n \n425.\tIn this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that “[the] proposed finding of infringement concerning information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, since it goes to show that Meta Ireland was aware of the questionable legality of that basis and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects”.  \n \n426.\tThe EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Instagram Terms of Use as an objective element, however this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations. In the EDPB’s view, the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient to indicate intention either.  \n \n\n427.\tTherefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE to act in breach of the law as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its legal obligations.  \n \n428.\tTherefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SA do not meet the threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.  \n \n429.\tAt the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.  \n \n430.\tThe EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, following the adoption of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests (see paragraph 421 of this Binding Decision), which means Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, given the fact that processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation.  \n \nThe degree of responsibility of the controller taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR)  \n \n431.\tThe EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regards to the transparency infringements.  \n \nThe financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)  \n \n432.\tThe SE SA argues Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract as legal basis for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Instagram. While not providing an estimate of its size, the SE SA considers the existence of financial benefit sufficiently proven on the basis of “the self-evident fact that Meta Ireland has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social media platform service, as opposed to establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear in the information to data subjects, it is a reasonable assumption that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to the processing, thus increasing the financial benefits gained by Meta Ireland pursuant to personal advertisement”. \n  \n433.\tAs explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from the infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. The aim of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR is to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case. \n  \n\n434.\tIn particular, in view of ensuring fines that are effective, proportionate and deterrent, and in light of common accepted practice in the field of EU competition law, which inspired the fining framework under the GDPR, the EDPB is of the view that, when calculating the administrative fine, supervisory authorities could take account of the financial benefits obtained from the infringement, in order to impose a fine that aim at “counterbalancing the gains from the infringement”.  \n \n435.\tWhen applying this provision, the supervisory authorities must “assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified”. Therefore, financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR.  \n \n436.\tIn the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.  \n437.\tNonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.  \n \nCompetitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)  \n \n438.\tThe NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “that the unlawful processing of personal data in all likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual or societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to [Meta IE]. The algorithms may have contributed to giving [Meta IE] a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors”. \n  \n439.\tOn principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.  \n \n***  \n \n440.\tTaking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency infringements relating to processing carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR821. The EDPB underlines that, in order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, a fine should reflect the circumstances of the case. Such circumstances not only refer to the specific elements of the infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely its financial position.  \n \n \n226.\tI have taken account of the above directions of the EDPB in the Article 83(2) assessments set out below. \n \n227.\tFinally, in relation to the new finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) GDPR principle of fairness that was established by the EDPB, the EDPB further directed that: \n \n444.\tAs previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent meaning. It underpins the whole data protection framework and plays a key role for securing a balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship. \n  \n445.\tConsidering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6.4.2 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements of the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects as to the processing of their personal data, fulfilling data subjects’ reasonable expectation, ensuring power balance, avoiding deception and ensuring ethical and truthful processing, as well as the overall effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB reiterates its view that Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into account by the IE SA in the calculation of the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed following the conclusion of this inquiry.  \n \n446.\tTherefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when re-assessing the administrative fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.  \n \n \n228.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, I do not consider an additional fine for the breach of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness that was established by the Article 65 Decision to be an appropriate corrective measure.  In this regard, I note that that the Board’s finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle was largely based on the lack of transparency, as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Terms of Use (see, for example, paragraphs 224, 225, 228 and 235 of the Article 65 Decision).  The Draft Decision contained separate proposed findings of infringement of the transparency obligations set out in Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c), together with corresponding proposals to exercise corrective powers in the form of an administrative fine and an order to bring processing into compliance.  In the circumstances, it is my view that the imposition of a fine for the finding of infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle would risk punishing Meta Ireland twice for the same wrongdoing. \n \n229.\tFrom the above starting points, the required assessments, for the purpose of Article 83(2), of the infringements that were found to have occurred elsewhere in this Decision are set out immediately below. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(A): THE NATURE, GRAVITY AND DURATION OF THE INFRINGEMENT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NATURE SCOPE OR PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING CONCERNED AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF DATA SUBJECTS AFFECTED AND THE LEVEL OF DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THEM \n \n230.\tAs a preliminary matter, I note that Article 83(2)(a) refers to the “infringement” as well as the “processing concerned” and that this criterion requires an assessment by reference to both.  In this regard, it is imperative to consider the meaning of both terms.   \n \nThe infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of transparency \n \n231.\tRead in conjunction with Article 83(3) – (5) GDPR, it is clear that the term “infringement” refers to an infringement of the GDPR.  As outlined above, I have found that Meta Ireland has infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR (the “Transparency Infringements”).  Thus, “the infringement”, for the purpose of my corresponding assessment of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria, should be understood (depending on the context in which the term is used) as meaning an infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  While I emphasise that each is an individual and discrete “infringement” of the GDPR, I am proposing to assess all three infringements simultaneously as all concern transparency and, by reason of their common nature and purpose, are likely to generate the same, or similar, outcomes in the context of some of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment criteria.  I will reference the infringements collectively as the “Transparency Infringements”, unless otherwise indicated to the contrary. \n \n232.\tThe phrase “the processing concerned”, in the context of the Transparency Infringements, should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that Meta Ireland carries out in the context of the Instagram service on the personal data under its controllership for which it indicated reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, including for the purposes of behavioural advertising .  The within Inquiry was based on an assessment of the extent to which Meta Ireland had complied with its transparency obligations in the context of a specific Complaint.  The Inquiry examined, inter alia the extent of the information Meta Ireland provided to the Complainant about processing carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  Given the generality of the Complaint and therefore the Inquiry, the precise parameters of this processing were not directly relevant to the factual analysis carried out.  The phrase “the processing concerned”, in the context of the Transparency Infringements, therefore refers simply to the processing addressed in the Decision i.e. the processing carried out by Meta Ireland for the purpose of delivering its Terms of Use, including processing personal data for behavioural advertising.  Notwithstanding the EDPB’s determination \nthat Meta Ireland is not permitted to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR when processing personal data for behavioural advertising purposes, I am required (by paragraph 346 of the Article 65 Decision) to retain the scope of the “processing concerned”, as set out above. \n \nThe infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR in the context of processing for behavioural advertising \n \n233.\tIn the context of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, the phrase “the processing concerned” should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that are carried out by Meta Ireland for the purpose of behavioural advertising. \n \n234.\tTaking this as my starting point, I will now assess the Article 83(2)(a) criterion in light of the particular circumstances of the Inquiry.  I note, in this regard, that Article 83(2)(a) comprises: the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement; the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned; the number of data subjects affected; and the level of damaged suffered by them; as follows: \n \nNature, gravity and duration of the infringement \n \n235.\tIn considering the nature of the Transparency Infringements, it must first be highlighted that the proposed findings of infringement concern data subject rights.  As set out in the analysis of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR above, my view is that the right concerned – the right to information – is a cornerstone of the rights of the data subject.  Indeed, the provision of the information concerned goes to the very heart of the fundamental right of the individual to protection of personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to share their personal data in a voluntary situation such as this.  If the required information has not been provided, the data subject has been deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision as to whether they wish to use a service that involves the processing of their personal data and engages their associated rights.  Furthermore, the extent to which a data controller has complied with its transparency obligations has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the other data subject rights.  If data subjects have not been provided with the prescribed information, they may be deprived of the knowledge they need in order to consider exercising one of the other data subject rights. \n \n236.\tAs regards the infringement of Article 5 GDPR, it should be noted that transparency “is an overarching principle that not only reinforces other principles (i.e. fairness, accountability), but from which many other provisions of the GDPR derive.”  It is therefore clear that failure to comply with the transparency principle has the potential to undermine other fundamental data protection principles, including but not limited to the principles of fairness and accountability. \n \n237.\tI further note, in this regard, that Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR are directed to the maximum fine that may be imposed in a particular case.  The maximum fine prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR is twice that prescribed by Article 83(4) GDPR.  The infringements covered by Article 83(5) GDPR include infringements of the data subject’s rights pursuant to Article 12 to 22 GDPR and infringements of the principles in Article 5 GDPR.  It is therefore clear that the legislator considered the data subject rights and the Article 5 GDPR principles to be particularly significant in the context of the data protection framework as a whole. \n \n238.\tIn this respect, Meta Ireland have argued that the nature of the Transparency Infringements amount to a good faith difference of opinion, and represent a new and subjective interpretation of the GDPR.   As part of my assessment of the Article 83(2)(c) GDPR criterion, which requires consideration of “any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects”, I note that it would be unfair to criticise Meta Ireland for failing to take action to mitigate any damage suffered in circumstances where its position was that no infringement had occurred and, accordingly, no damage had been suffered by data subjects. This does not, however, do anything to alter the infringement’s objectively serious character. \n \n239.\tIn terms of the nature of the Article 6(1) infringement that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 410 of the Article 65 Decision records that: \n \n“The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection”. \n \n \n240.\tIn expressing this view, the Board referred to page 10 of the objection raised by the Norwegian SA, which states, in this regard, that: \n \n“OBA [online behavioural advertising] entails profiling, which inherently constitutes risks for the data subjects’ integrity. The less transparent the profiling algorithms are, the higher the risk, and in this case, there is no meaningful, sufficiently detailed information about the functioning of MPILI’s algorithms available to us. \n \nFurthermore, on the Instagram platform, profiling is used to make decisions by way of automated means regarding what information the data subjects are exposed to. Important to note is that this equally means that decisions are taken as regards which information data subjects do not see and thus are excluded from receiving. The information may inter alia include commercial advertisements, political advertising, housing postings et cetera, and it may be of a manipulative nature”. \n \n \n241.\tIn considering the nature and scope of the processing in the context of the analysis leading to the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) itself, the Board noted, at paragraphs 98 to 100 of the Article 65 Decision, that: \n \n“…Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device. According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way. \n \nThe EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service, as well as off the Facebook service itself, through third party websites and apps which are connected to Facebook.com via programming interfaces (“Facebook Business Tools”), including the Instagram service. Furthermore, among the aspects described in the Instagram Terms of Use is “Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.” which involves “shar[ing] technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you.” It is therefore clear that personal data is shared between Facebook companies (”We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads (...)”  \n \nThese are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and expect behavioural advertising when they accept the Instagram Terms of Use and perceive it as necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service”. \n \n \n242.\tWith specific reference to the scope of the processing, paragraph 413 of the Article 65 Decision records that: \n \n“With respect to the scope of processing, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that “Meta Ireland processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a ‘personalised’ experience, including by way of serving personalised advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered [...]’”’  \n \n \n243.\tIt is therefore clear that the Board considers the Article 6(1) infringement to concern one of the “fundamental pillars” of the GDPR and the nature and scope of the processing to be extensive, complex, intrusive and on a massive scale.  I further note, in this regard, that paragraph 412 of the Article 65 Decision indicates that the Board considered the nature of the infringement to be significant, in the context of its conclusion that an administrative fine ought to be imposed in relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. \n \n244.\tAs regards the gravity of the Transparency Infringements, my findings are such that Meta Ireland has not provided the required information in the required manner under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and has also infringed Articles 12(1) and 5(1)(a) GDPR.  This, in my view, represents a significant level of non-compliance, taking into account the importance of the right to information, the consequent impact on the data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects potentially affected (each of which is considered further below).  The clear inconsistencies between the transparency guidelines and the manner in which Meta Ireland attempted to comply with its obligations makes clear that the Commission’s interpretation is neither new nor subjective.  I would add that I have set out (below) the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective.  This is more than sufficient to show the negative impact that this has had on data subjects and specifically on the Named Data Subject. \n \n245.\tMeta Ireland have alleged that the Transparency Infringements are “marginal” in their nature and gravity because the Commission’s interpretation amounts to new and subjective views being imposed on it.  I do not accept that these views are new or subjective.  I set out at Section 5 the extent to which this level of compliance is expected by the transparency guidelines, which are a publicly available document.  The clear inconsistencies between the transparency guidelines and the manner in which Meta Ireland have attempted to comply with its obligations makes clear that the Commission’s interpretation is neither new nor subjective.  The Commission is carrying out its functions under the GDPR, by interpreting and applying the relevant provisions of the GDPR to the Complaint before it.  I also note Meta Ireland’s argument that no evidence has been presented of the impact on data subjects from a lack of transparency.   In this respect, I emphasise that this entire Complaint arises from a failure to provide sufficiently transparent information such that the Named Data Subject could not understand the agreement to the Terms of Use was not consent in the sense meant in the GDPR.  Moreover, I have already set out in Section 5, the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective.  I disagree with Meta Ireland’s submission that this is “purely hypothetical”.   This is more than sufficient to show the negative impact that this has had on data subjects and specifically on the Named Data Subject.  \nGiven this significant impact, as set out in this Decision, I cannot accept the suggestion from Meta \nIreland that the administrative fine be replaced with a reprimand.  \n \n246.\tIn terms of the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision does not identify, with any particularisation, the EDPB’s position on the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement.  I note, however, that paragraph 412 of the Article 65 Decision indicates that the Board considered the gravity of the infringement to be significant, in the context of its conclusion that an administrative fine ought to be imposed in relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, stating: \n \n“As mentioned above and outlined below, the nature and gravity of the infringement clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine” \n \n \n247.\tIn this regard, I note that infringements of Article 6 are subject to the higher fining threshold set out in Article 83(5) GDPR.  The maximum fine prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR is twice that prescribed by Article 83(4) GDPR.  This arrangement clearly indicates that the legislator considered the matters covered by Article 83(5) GDPR to be particularly significant in the context of the data protection framework as a whole.   \n \n248.\tIn terms of the duration of the Transparency Infringements, this complaint-based Inquiry relates in part to a lack of information provided to the Complainant as regards the lawful basis relied on and the connection between Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and specific processing operation(s) or set(s) of operations.  The Complaint therefore relates to the transparency of the relevant documents at the time the Complaint was lodged.  In that sense, this Inquiry relates to specific alleged infringements at a specific point in time, because that is what the Complaint concerns.  In imposing corrective powers however, the GDPR requires that the broader impact of infringements be considered (as I will set out below in relation to each individual criterion).  To that extent, it is necessary at times to move from the specific to the general.  \n \n249.\tI should, at this juncture, note that the Commission is not required to apply the same approach across all inquiries, regardless of the differences between such inquiries.  In this respect, I acknowledge Meta Ireland’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft in which Meta Ireland took issue with various alleged inconsistencies between the approach to factors considered in administrative fines in the Preliminary Draft and in other decisions made by the Commission under the GDPR to date.304  I do not agree that there is any inconsistency in the manner in which it has assessed the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria. The Commission is not required to apply the same approach across all inquiries, regardless of the differences between such inquiries.   \n \n250.\tThe Commission’s approach to the presence or absence of relevant previous infringements (for the purpose of the Article 83(2)(e) GDPR assessment) differs, depending inter alia on the contexts of different types of controllers, particularly as concerns the scale of the processing at issue.  In this regard, the Commission is entitled to take account of whether data controllers or processors with multi-national operations have significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams.  Moreover, such entitles are further likely to be engaged in business activities that are uniquely dependent on the large-scale processing of personal data.  The Commission’s view is that the size and scale of such entities, the level of dependency on data processing and the extensive resources that are available to them necessitate a different approach to the absence of previous relevant infringements.  That approach has been reflected in the decisions that differ in their considerations of particular factors from this one. In the circumstances, the Commission does not accept that there has been an inconsistency in the Commission’s approach to determining the quantum of any fine. \n \n251.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision does not contain any indication in relation to the manner in which the Board took account of the duration of the Article 6(1) infringement.  In this respect, I note that the infringement has occurred since 25 May 2018 and remains ongoing. \n \nTaking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned \n \n252.\tThe personal data processing carried out by Meta Ireland in the context of the Instagram service pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive.  Meta Ireland processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a “personalised” experience, including by way of serving personalised advertisements.  The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered, and, for this reason, the provision of compliant information in relation to that processing becomes even more important.  This, indeed, may include location and IP address data.   \n \n253.\tIn response to my consideration of this matter in the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland alleged that its “difficulty in striking the right balance between presenting sufficient information but in a way which remains concise, intelligible and accessible” was illustrative of the marginal nature of noncompliance.   I do not consider this to be the case given the extent of non-compliance I have outlined in Section 5.  Meta Ireland also expressed concern that I was considering “a much wider range of processing” than processing to facilitate behavioural advertising.   For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I have only taken account of processing to facilitate behavioural advertising. \n \n254.\tThe EDPB’s views, as regards the scope of the processing concerned, in the context of the Article 6(1) infringement have already been recorded at paragraph 242 above. \n \nThe number of data subjects affected \n \n255.\tIn submissions dated 28 September 2018, Meta Ireland stated that it “provides the Instagram service to hundreds of millions of users across the European region”.    \n \n256.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, I noted, in the Draft Decision, that Meta Ireland had confirmed that, as of the date of the commencement of the Inquiry, i.e. 31 August 2018, it had approximately  monthly active accounts and, as of December 2021, it had approximately  monthly active users in the European Economic Area.   In the Draft Decision, I noted \nthat, surprisingly, Meta Ireland excluded the number of UK active accounts in these calculations on the understanding that “such accounts in that territory are not relevant to the Inquiry”.   This understanding is not correct; as the GDPR was applicable in the UK at the date of the Complaint and it was my view that these accounts are in fact relevant to this Inquiry and must be taken account. \n \n257.\tEurostat, the statistical office of the European Union confirms that, as of 1 January 2020, the population of the “”EU 27” was approximately 488 million, the population of the UK was approximately 67 million, the population of Norway was approximately 5 million, and the populations of Iceland and Liechtenstein were approximately 364,000 and 39,000 respectively.  \n \n258.\tBy reference to these figures, the total population of the EEA (including the UK) by reference to the latest available figures is approximately 520 million. While it is not possible, or indeed necessary, for me to identify the precise number of users affected by the Infringements, it is useful to have some point of reference in order to consider the extent of EEA data subjects that are potentially affected by the Transparency Infringements. \n \n259.\tParagraph 223 of the Draft Decision noted the confirmation, provided by Meta Ireland that, as at the date of the commencement of the Inquiry (i.e. 31 August 2018), it had approximately   monthly active users and, as of December 2021, it had approximately  monthly \nactive users in the EEA, excluding the number of UK active accounts. \n \n260.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 414 of the Article 65 Decision records that “the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal data of a significant number of people” \n \n261.\tIn expressing the above view, the Board referred to paragraph 253 of the Draft Decision, which records that a “significant portion of the population of the EEA seems to have been impacted by the Infringements”.   \n \n262.\tIn this regard, the Board referred to pages 9 and 11 of the objection raised by the German SAs which references the risks to “hundreds of millions of data subjects within the EU”.  The Board also referred to pages 10 – 11 of the objection raised by the Norwegian SA which, referring to paragraph 223 of the Draft Decision, states that “the number of data subjects affected in the EEA amounts to hundreds of millions”. \n \nThe level of damage suffered by them \n \n263.\tIn relation to the Transparency Infringements, I note that Recital 75 (which acts as an aid to the interpretation of Article 24 GDPR, the provision that addresses the responsibility of the controller), describes the “damage” that can result where processing does not accord with the requirements of the GDPR:  \n \n“The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material or nonmaterial damage, in particular: … where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data …” \n \n264.\tAs set out above, my findings are such that users have not been provided with the information in relation to processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR that they are entitled to receive.  This represents, in my view, quite a significant information deficit and one which, by any assessment of matters, can equate to a significant inability to exercise control over personal data.  I have also pointed out the centrality of the processing to Meta Ireland’s business model in respect of the Instagram service.  This makes it all the more important that information on this processing be provided in a transparent manner, and makes the implications of it not being provided in such a manner all the more significant. \n \n265.\tI further note that the failure to provide all of the prescribed information undermines the effectiveness of the data subject rights and, consequently, infringes the rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned.  A core element of transparency is empowering data subjects to make informed decisions about engaging with activities that cause their personal data to be processed, and making informed decisions about whether to exercise particular rights, and whether they can do so. This right is undermined by a lack of transparency on the part of a data controller. \n \n266.\tMeta Ireland have argued that the above amounts to mere “speculation”.   I have already set out in detail in this Decision the risks to data subject rights involved in the denial of transparency, \nand indeed provided the concrete example of the breach of the Named Data Subject’s right to transparency about the use of his personal data. This is more than sufficient to show that rights have been damaged in a significant manner, given the lack of an opportunity to exercise data subject rights while being fully informed. \n \n267.\tIn the context of the finding of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 415 of the Article 65 Decision records that: \n \n“Though the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that data subjects have been faced with data processing that should not have occurred (by relying inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis as established in Section 4.4.2). The data processing in question - behavioural advertising - entails decisions about information that data subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, a risk of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself.” \n \n \n268.\tParagraph 133 of the Article 65 Decision considers the risks arising from the Article 6(1) infringement as follows: \n \n“Given that the main purpose for which a user uses Instagram service is to share and receive content, and communicate with others. The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and 7 and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 237, and that Meta IE conditions their use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the behavioural advertising they include, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue”. \n \n \n269.\tIn paragraph 135 of the Article 65 Decision, the Board further considered that: \n \n“Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis, instead of others such as consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).” \n \n \n270.\tIt therefore appears that the Board considered the infringement to give rise to a risk of loss of control over, and ability to exercise choice concerning, one’s personal data.  This is consistent with the complainant’s position that the infringement had the effect of negating his consent/free will.   \n \n271.\tI also consider that that the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle may be taken into account, as required by the Article 65 Decision, under this particular heading.  I note, in this regard, paragraph 229 of the Article 65 Decision, which records the Board’s view that: \n \t \n“Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is particularly important to ensure that data subjects are protected from any form of abuse and deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into account the particular service that is being provided and the characteristics of their users, serves as a shield from the danger of abuse and deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries.” \n \n \n272.\tThe Board further notes, at paragraphs 233 and 234 of the Article 65 Decision, that: \n \n“the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Instagram users are left “in the dark” and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, which ultimately restricts the Instagram users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights.  \n \n…Considering the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Instagram users in a misleading manner429, which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights.” \n \n \n273.\tThe Board’s views highlight the same damage as already identified above, namely the loss of control over, and ability to exercise choice concerning, one’s personal data. \n \n274.\tOn the basis of the views that have been expressed by the Board, as recorded above, I proposed to conclude that the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR falls within the upper range of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of the assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion.  In its Final Submissions, Meta Ireland expressed disagreement with the proposed conclusion and underlying assessments set out above. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n275.\tFollowing the amendment of the Draft Decision to take account of the EDPB’s Article 65 Decision, Meta Ireland was invited to exercise its right to be heard in relation to those aspects of the Draft Decision in relation to which the Commission was required to make a final determination or, otherwise, to exercise its discretion.  Meta Ireland furnished its submissions on these matters under cover of letter dated 19 December 2022 (“the Final Submissions”). \n \n276.\tIn relation to the nature of the Article 6(1) infringement, Meta Ireland submitted that the EDPB’s conclusion on this aspect of matters “is not correct and not supported by the evidence, particularly where (i) the [Commission] itself found Meta Ireland’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) for the Behavioural Advertising Processing valid in principle, meaning the infringement found cannot be said to have been “clear”; and (ii) the Article 65 Decision acknowledges that legal bases are available under Article 6(1) for the Behavioural Advertising Processing and that there is no hierarchy between those legal bases”.   In this regard, Meta Ireland respectfully urgeed the Commission not to adopt the EDPB’s flawed arguments with respect to Article 83(2)(a) in light of a number of  “significant errors in the EDPB’s reasoning” that it has identified in its Final Submissions.   \n \n277.\tIn circumstances where the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission, I am not in a position to act contrary to the views that have been so expressed the EDPB. \n \n278.\tIn relation to the gravity of the infringement, Meta Ireland, firstly, noted that the Article 65 Decision does not articulate any clear reasoning or position with respect to the gravity of the purported infringement, rendering the assessment of this element meaningless.  Meta Ireland further submitted that a “finding in respect of gravity cannot simply be extrapolated from the fact that the infringement found is subject to a particular fining cap in accordance with Article 83(5), with no reference to the facts”.   Meta Ireland submitted that gravity should not be considered significant or an aggravating factor for the same reasons as those provided in response to the proposed assessment of the nature of the assessment, as summarised above. \n \n279.\tAs before, the Commission is not in a position to act contrary to the views that have been clearly expressed by the EDPB in its binding Article 65 Decision.  As already acknowledged, the EDPB has not elaborated on the reasons why it considers the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement to be one of the factors that tip the balance in favour of the imposition of a fine.  This does not alter, however, the fact, however, that the EDPB clearly considered the gravity of the Article 6(1) infringement to be one of the factors that warranted the imposition of a fine.  In these circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to conclude that the gravity of the infringement is not significant in terms of its impact on the overall assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion. \n \n280.\tIn relation to the duration of the infringement, Meta Ireland submits that duration “should not be considered an aggravating factor in this particular case”.   In the absence of any specific direction from the EDPB, in this regard, the Commission has not treated this factor as being significant, in terms of its impact on the overall assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion. \n \n281.\tIn relation to the number of data subjects and the level of damage suffered by them, Meta Ireland submitted that: \n \n•\t“the only data subject who is relevant for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) is the data subject represented by the Complainant and any consideration of the level of damage suffered is confined to a consideration of any damage the Complainant may have suffered. No evidence of any such damage has been adduced in the Inquiry”; \n \n•\t“even if it is open to the [Commission] to consider whether other data subjects have been affected and to have regard to any damage suffered by them, there is no evidence whatsoever in this Inquiry that any other data subjects have suffered any damage”; \n \n•\t“the [Commission’s] assessment of whether damage has been suffered for the purposes of Article 83(2)(a) must be based on evidence of damage stemming from the specific infringement in question (here, the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement). It is not permissible for the DPC to assume that the Complainant has suffered damage or to base the calculation of the proposed Article 6(1) fine on “the same damage as already identified” as the basis for the proposed Article 5(1)(a) fine”; \n \n•\t“an alleged “loss of control” should not be equated with damage within the meaning of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR”; and \n \n•\t“there is no evidence to support the assertion that users experienced a “loss of control”; nor is there any factual or evidential basis for such a claim. This is especially true considering that everyone has a choice as to whether they wish to use the Instagram Service in the first place, and can always deactivate their accounts”.  \n \n282.\tIn response to the above submissions, it is, firstly, important to note that the Commission is subject to a binding decision of the EDPB, which includes an assessment of the damage suffered by data subjects, at paragraph 415 thereof.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to find that no damage has been suffered.  Secondly, the Complainant himself identified the damage that he alleges he suffered in connection with the matters which formed the basis for the EDPB’s findings of infringement of Article 6(1) and the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness.  Thirdly, as regards the damage suffered by data subjects other than the Complainant, the matters covered by the findings of infringement are not matters on which any individual user of the Instagram Service has the power to exercise choice (other than, of course, the choice to use the Instagram Service or not).  Where any individual data subject chooses to use the Instagram Service, the basic processing that takes place (the subject of the within Inquiry) is the same as that applied to the personal data of the Complainant.  In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the identified damage suffered, i.e. loss of control over one’s personal data, is limited to the Complainant alone.  For these reasons, it is appropriate for the Commission to take account of the damage suffered by all user data subjects as part of the Article 83(2) assessment. \n \n283.\tHaving taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the view that the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR falls within the upper range of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of the assessment of the Article 83(2)(a) criterion. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(B): THE INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT CHARACTER OF THE INFRINGEMENT \n \n284. In respect of the character of the Transparency Infringements, I note that the GDPR does not identify the precise factors that need to be present in order for an infringement to be classified as either “intentional” or “negligent”.  As the Article 29 Working Party considered the meaning of “character of the infringement” in its “Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679” (the “Article 29 Working Group Fining Guidelines”),  I have had regard to this interpretation in my assessment, notwithstanding the fact that these guidelines are non-binding on me.  The Article 29 Working Party took the view as follows: \n \n“In general, “intent” includes both knowledge and wilfulness in relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas “unintentional” means that there was no intention to cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the law. \n… \nCircumstances indicative of intentional breaches might be unlawful processing authorised explicitly by the top management hierarchy of the controller, or in spite of advice from the data protection officer or in disregard for existing policies, for example obtaining and processing data about employees at a competitor with an intention to discredit that competitor in the market. \n… \nOther circumstances, such as failure to read and abide by existing policies, human error, failure to check for personal data in information published, failure to apply technical updates in a timely manner, failure to adopt policies (rather than simply failure to apply them)may be indicative of negligence”.  \n \nIn this regard, I further note that, as a general point, an intentional infringement is more severe than an unintentional infringement.   \n \n285.\tIn the course of the Complainant’s submissions, the Complainant expressed the view that the infringements by Meta Ireland were intentional in character.   In this vein, the Complainant alleged that Meta Ireland made a deliberate and calculated decision to present the information in a particular manner such as to mislead data subjects.  I do accept that Meta Ireland made a deliberate decision to present the information to data subjects in a particular way.   \n \n286.\tHowever, I am not satisfied, on the evidence available to me, that Meta Ireland made a particular decision to infringe the GDPR, in particular as regards its transparency obligations.  It appears clear to me that the Article 29 Working Party Fining Guidelines referred to above explicitly recognise that an intentional breach generally only occurs when there is a deliberate act to infringe the GDPR.  In this regard, I also emphasise that a finding of intentionality is predicated on knowledge and wilfulness as to the characteristics of an offence.  There is no evidence that this is satisfied in respect of the infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(a) GDPR. \n \n287.\tMeta Ireland argued that where it was found to have a “’genuinely held belief’ that it was adhering to its [transparency] obligations”, it is “unfair” and contrary to the principle of legal certainty to find that it is negligent.   I do not agree; Meta Ireland should have been aware of its transparency requirements, especially in light of the transparency guidelines,   and should have provided clarity about the precise extent of the processing operations carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  \nMeta Ireland further should have ensured that it adhered strictly to its transparency obligations when choosing the lawful bases on which they rely and should have used these obligations as a guide as to the information to be conveyed to data subjects.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the infringements are negligent in character. \n \n288.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraphs 418 to 430, inclusive, of the Article 65 Decision record as follows: \n \n“The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the willfulness in relation to such act. By contrast, an infringement is “unintentional” when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement. \n \nThe characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis of objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case.  It is worth noting the broader approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain degree of knowledge about a potential infringement. This provides an indication that noncompliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence. \n \nThe SE SA argues that Meta IE “has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the aforementioned [EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] – which clearly gives doubt to the legality of the processing – which were first adopted on 9 April 2019 and made final on 8 October 2019. The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date”. \n \nThe EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive - is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application. Second, WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”. \n \nIt stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated.  \n \n\nThe EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the “will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the “wilfulness” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality. While it may prove difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality.  \n \nThe EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”, rather than “intentionality” when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation”. In this regard, while the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place for the safeguard of personal data, this does not, however, per se change the nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional.  \n \nIn this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that “[the] proposed finding of infringement concerning information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, since it goes to show that Meta Ireland was aware of the questionable legality of that basis and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects” \n \nThe EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Instagram Terms of Use as an objective element, however this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations. In the EDPB’s view, the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient to indicate intention either.  \n \nTherefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE to act in breach of the law as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its legal obligations.  \n \nTherefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SA do not meet the threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.  \n \nAt the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.  \n \nThe EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, \nfollowing the adoption of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests (see paragraph 421 of this Binding Decision), which means Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, given the fact that processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation”. \n \n \n289.\tParagraph 468 of the Article 65 Decision records the Board’s instruction for the Commission to have due regard to the “seriously negligent character of the infringement” in determining the amount of the fine.  On the basis of the views that have been expressed by the EDPB, as recorded above, I proposed to treat this factor as an aggravating factor of significant weight.   \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n290.\tIn its Final Submissions, Meta Ireland disagreed with the above conclusion on the basis of a range of submissions, all of which challenge the basis for the EDPB’s conclusion.   Meta Ireland submitted that the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR can “at most be considered inadvertent, such that this should not be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of Article 83(2).”  In the alternative, Meta Ireland submitted that the Commission should not afford any material weight to this factor in light of its “good faith reliance on what it considered to be a valid legal basis, (b) the errors in the reasoning of the EDPB [as identified]; and (c) the lack of legal certainty in the interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.” \n \n291.\tMeta Ireland, in its Final Submissions, also sought clarification as to whether I proposed to characterise this infringement as intentional due to a typographical error in the material furnished to Meta Ireland to enable it to make its Final Submissions.324  For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that this was a typographical error. \n \n292.\tAs already noted, above, the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to disregard the views that have been clearly expressed by the EDPB, in relation to the character of the Article 6(1) infringement.  In circumstances where the EDPB has determined the Article 6(1)(b) infringement to be “seriously negligent” in character, I remain of the view that this classification requires me to treat this factor \nas an aggravating factor of significant weight, notwithstanding Meta Ireland’s Final Submissions on this point. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(C): ANY ACTION TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO DATA SUBJECTS \n \n293.\tMeta Ireland’s position, in the context of the Transparency Infringements, is that it has discharged its transparency obligations in respect of the Instagram service and, accordingly, complies fully with the GDPR in this respect.  Although, as I have outlined in the course of my findings, I do not agree with this position, I nonetheless accept on the facts available to me that this represents a genuinely held belief on Meta Ireland’s part.  It follows therefore that there has not been an effort to mitigate the damage to data subjects as it was Meta Ireland’s position that data subjects were incurring no such damage.  Nonetheless, I am not prepared to find that the lack of any mitigating action should necessarily be considered an aggravating factor.   \n \n294.\tMeta Ireland argued that my analysis is flawed because it takes no account of the effort made to comply with the GDPR.   However, it is my view that there is no reason why, on the basis of the transparency guidelines, Meta Ireland could not have taken steps to ensure compliance and thereby mitigate damage.  I am not satisfied that there is any reason why day-to-day compliance related activities in a large multinational organisation, which is an important legal duty and commonplace business activity, could be considered a mitigating factor.  Taking steps to attempt to comply with legal obligations is a duty, and has no mitigating impact on a sanction for a breach of those obligations.  This is distinct from any act that might be taken to mitigate specific damage to data subjects.  I am not of course treating this factor as aggravating given that, beyond simply complying with the GDPR, there are no obvious mitigating steps that could have been taken.  It is on this basis that I treat this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating.  \n \n295.\tI do, however, take account of and acknowledge Meta Ireland’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the conclusion of this Inquiry.   I consider this to be a mitigating factor and have taken account of this. \n \n296.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, this aspect of the Article 83(2) assessment was not addressed in the Article 65 Decision.  I note that Meta Ireland’s position, throughout this Inquiry, has been one whereby it considered that it was entitled to process personal data for behavioural advertising purposes, insofar as that formed a core part of the Instagram Terms of Use, in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  That being the case, it follows that Meta Ireland could not have been expected to take action “to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects” in circumstances where Meta Ireland did not consider any infringement to have occurred or any damage to have been suffered by data subjects.  In the circumstances, the Commission proposed to consider this factor to be neither aggravating nor mitigating. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n297.\tIn the Final Submissions, Meta Ireland urged me to take account of various mitigating matters such as the absence of evidence of harm and the fact that various voluntary steps have been taken to improve transparency for users since the Inquiry has commenced, including as recently as July 2022.  I note that I have already addressed Meta Ireland’s submissions concerning the absence of evidence of harm, as part of the Article 83(2)(a) assessment.  In relation to the voluntary changes that have been made since the date of circulation, to the CSAs, of the Draft Decision, the Commission is unable to give credit to these changes, as a mitigating factor, without an assessment of the changes themselves.  Given that such an assessment is not possible within the temporal scope of the within Inquiry, the Commission is unable to treat this matter as a mitigating factor.  Accordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither aggravating nor mitigating.    \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(D): THE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THEM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES 25 AND 32 \n \n298.\tIn respect of this factor, the Article 29 Working Party Fining Guidelines advise that the following approach should be taken: \n \n“The question that the supervisory authority must then answer is to what extent the controller “did what it could be expected to do” given the nature, the purposes or the size of the processing, seen in light of the obligations imposed on them by the Regulation. \nIn this assessment, due account should be taken of any “best practice” procedures or methods where these exist and apply. Industry standards, as well as codes of conduct in the respective field or profession are important to take into account. Codes of practice might give an indication as to what is common practice in the field and an indication of the level of knowledge about different means to address typical security issues associated with the processing”.  \n \n299.\tIn this regard, I am satisfied that, on the facts available to me, Meta Ireland held a genuine belief that its provision of information in respect of processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the Instagram service was in compliance with its transparency obligations.  Indeed, as I have outlined above in respect of my analysis of Article 83(2)(b), I am satisfied that Meta Ireland did not act in a deliberate or knowing manner to infringe the GDPR.  In its response to the Preliminary Draft, Meta Ireland argued that “it is inconsistent and illogical to find that a genuine effort to achieve compliance, based on a ‘genuine belief’, nevertheless amounts to ‘a high degree of responsibility’”.  \n \n300.\tMeta Ireland is correct that other actions, such as no genuine effort to comply, attract a higher degree of responsibility, however it does not follow that a genuine belief necessarily implies no or low responsibility.  Indeed, I emphasise that Meta Ireland made a deliberate and knowing decision to present the information to users in a particular manner.  As I have outlined in the course of my analysis in respect of Issue 3, the provision of information in this regard has fallen significantly below the standards that are expected of controllers.  I note Meta Ireland’s submission that its compliance should have been assessed as against industry standards.   In this respect, I think it is sufficient to have assessed compliance by reference to the standards set in the GDPR and expounded on in the transparency guidance. \n \n301.\tI note, in this regard, that guidance as to the substance of the transparency obligations under the GDPR was available to Meta Ireland at the date of the Complaint.   I am therefore satisfied that Meta Ireland should have been aware of the appropriate standards – albeit at a general level – and, having made a deliberate decision to present the information in a manner which fell significantly below the standard required, has a high degree of responsibility for the lack of compliance with the GDPR.  Accordingly, I consider this to be an aggravating factor in the determination of any administrative fine. \n \n302.\tIn relation to the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraph 431 of the Article 65 Decision records that: \n \n“The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regards to the transparency infringements.” \n \n \n303.\tIn expressing this view, the Board referred to paragraph 240 of the Draft Decision which states: \n \n“I note, in this regard, that guidance as to the substance of the transparency obligations under the GDPR was available to Meta Ireland at the date of the Complaint. I am therefore satisfied that Meta Ireland should have been aware of the appropriate standards – albeit at a general level – and, having made a deliberate decision to present the information in a manner which fell significant below the standard required, has a high degree of responsibility for the lack of compliance with the GDPR. Accordingly, I consider this to be an aggravating factor in the determination of any administrative fine.” \n \n \n304.\tFootnote 811 of the Article 65 Decision further records that: \n \n“the EDPB notes that the high degree of responsibility of Meta IE for the non-compliance with the \nGDPR was considered as an aggravating factor by LSA for the calculation of the fine.” \n \n \n305.\tIn the circumstances, and based on the above, I proposed to consider this to be an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n306.\tIn its Final Submissions, Meta Ireland disagreed with the above assessment on the basis that “the EDPB’s conclusion at para. 431 of the Article 65 Decision that Meta Ireland had a “high level” of responsibility pursuant to this factor is based on an incomplete analysis and the EDPB fails to consider any of the relevant subfactors set forth by the Article 29 Working Party Draft Administrative Fine Guidelines in reaching its conclusion.”   \n \n307.\tAs already noted above, the EDPB’s Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, the Commission is not permitted to look behind the EDPB’s views and determinations.  In the circumstances, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(E): ANY RELEVANT PREVIOUS INFRINGEMENTS BY THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR \n \n308.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, I noted that the Commission has not made any findings of infringements by Meta Ireland in the context of the Instagram service which could be considered relevant for my assessment.   I note Meta Ireland’s view that this should be considered a mitigating factor.  I do not agree that a lack of any relevant previous infringements by a controller necessarily constitutes a mitigating factor for the purpose of this assessment.  In this regard, I emphasise that the GDPR has only been in force for a relatively short period of time and, accordingly, it is not unusual or indeed unexpected that there may be no relevant previous infringements by the controller.  It can therefore be said that a lack of relevant previous infringement does not necessarily signal a general level of good practice by controller and, on this basis, I am not prepared to find that a lack of previous relevant infringements is necessarily a mitigating factor.   \n \n309.\tMeta Ireland compared the lack of mitigation in this regard to a decision of the Commission on a domestic matter.   I have already set out my views on these arguments above.  Further, the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria are matters that I must consider when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and, if so, the amount of that fine.  The Article 83(2) GDPR criteria are not binary in nature, such that, when assessed in the context of the circumstances of infringement, they must be found to be either a mitigating or an aggravating factor. \n \n310.\tAlthough Meta Ireland has no previous relevant infringements in the context of the Instagram service, I do not think that this is either a mitigating or aggravating factor for the purposes of my assessment. \n \n311.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision does not address this aspect of matters.  As at the date of circulation of the Draft Decision, were there no relevant previous infringements by Meta Ireland that fell to be considered under this particular heading.  In the circumstances, the Commission proposed to consider this factor to be neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n312.\tMeta Ireland, in its Final Submissions, disagreed with the above, instead, urged the Commission to treat this factor as mitigating, in line with the Commission’s approach in other (named) inquiries.334  I note, in this regard, that the named inquiries do not concern cross-border processing.   \n \n313.\tIn response to the above, the Commission is not required to apply the same approach across all of its inquiries.  The Commission’s approach to the presence or absence of relevant previous infringements (for the purpose of the Article 83(2)(e) assessment) differs, depending inter alia on the contexts of different types of controllers and, in particular, the scale of the processing at issue.  Unlike the position with the smaller-scale domestic inquiries that Meta Ireland has cited as examples, inquiries into larger internet platforms generally concern data controllers or processors with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, inhouse, compliance teams.  Such entitles are further likely to be engaged in business activities that are uniquely dependent on the large-scale processing of personal data.  The Commission’s view is that the size and scale of such entities, the level of dependency on data processing and the extensive resources that are available to them necessitate a different approach to the absence of previous relevant infringements.  That approach has been reflected in the decisions that have been cited by Meta Ireland in support of its submission. I note, in this regard, that Meta Ireland’s submissions do not reference the Commission’s decision in the Twitter (breach notification) inquiry, nor the Commission’s decision in the WhatsApp (own volition) transparency inquiry, nor the Facebook (12 breaches) inquiry.  The Commission’s approach to the Article 83(2) assessment, as recorded in these decisions (amongst others), is consistent with that applied to the within inquiry.  Accordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(F): THE DEGREE OF COOPERATION WITH THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY, IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE INFRINGEMENT AND MITIGATE THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE INFRINGEMENT \n \n314.\tIn considering the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, I first note that there is a general duty on controllers to cooperate under Article 31 GDPR.  It is therefore important to remember that controllers are legally obliged to cooperate in the course of an inquiry and cooperation is not necessarily a mitigating factor.  Indeed, this is also the position set out in the Article 29 Working Party Fining Guidelines, which state that: \n \n“it would not be appropriate to give additional regard to cooperation that is already required by law for example, the entity is in any case required to allow the supervisory authority access to premises for audits/inspections”.  \n \nIn this regard, I emphasise that to decide otherwise would mean that the activities of entities acting in the ordinary course of adhering to legal duties to cooperate would be considered a mitigating factor for the purposes of calculating a sanction.  It would follow that all controllers adhering to their legal duties – with the exception of those who act in a deliberately uncooperative manner – would benefit from a mitigation in sanction.  I cannot accept that this was the intention of the legislator.   \n \n315.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, it is Meta Ireland’s position that cooperation in this matter should be treated as a mitigating factor, and again cites a decision of the Commission.   I once again refer to my analysis on that issue above.  This position reflects the erroneous treatment of the Article 83(2) GDPR factors as binary choices between mitigation and aggravation to which I have already referred. I note once again that Meta Ireland is seeking to voluntarily comply, and note that I have already taken this into account above as a mitigating factor. \n \n316.\tIn the course of this Inquiry, Meta Ireland have cooperated fully with the Commission as it is required to do in accordance with the law, Article 31 GDPR in particular.  Given that all such cooperation was in accordance with its legal duties to cooperate, I do not consider such cooperation to constitute either a mitigating or aggravating factor for the purposes of my assessment. \n \n317.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this aspect of matters.  In the circumstances, I proposed to consider this factor to be neither mitigating nor aggravating for the same reasons set out in the Article 83(2)(c) assessment, above.   \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n318.\tIn its Final Submissions, Meta Ireland submitted that I should treat this as a mitigating factor it light of the fact that it has taken “various voluntary steps to improve transparency for its users (which the EDPB considers underpins the alleged Article 6(1) infringement) throughout the course of the Inquiry … and will undertake all efforts to comply with any order issued by the DPC, as required”.  Meta Ireland further submitted that it has “cooperated fully with the DPC throughout the Inquiry”.    \n \n319.\tI have already addressed the reasons why I cannot take account, as a mitigating factor, of any voluntary steps taken by Meta Ireland following the date of circulation of the Draft Decision to the CSAs (the steps taken before that date having been deemed, by the EDPB, to be insufficient to be treated as a mitigating factor).  While the Commission recognises that Meta Ireland has cooperated fully throughout the Inquiry, the Commission notes that Meta Ireland is obliged to do so by virtue of Article 31 GDPR.  Furthermore, and while the Commission acknowledges Meta Ireland’s commitment to undertake “all efforts to comply with any order” that might be issued further to this Decision, I again note that Meta Ireland is subject to an obligation to comply with the terms of the relevant order.  In the circumstances, I am unable to take account of such matters as mitigating factors. \n \n320.\tAccordingly, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(G): THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA AFFECTED BY THE INFRINGEMENT \n \n321.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, the lack of transparency concerned broad categories of personal data in respect of users who sign up to the Instagram service.  I accept that this assessment of data processing in this Inquiry was rather generalised in nature.  I further note that Meta Ireland’s lack of transparency did itself contribute to a lack of clarity as to the precise categories of personal data relevant for this Inquiry.  Nonetheless, given that, on the facts available to me, there is no evidence that this concerned personal data of a particularly sensitive nature, I regard this factor as neither aggravating nor mitigating for the purposes of my assessment.  While Meta Ireland have alleged it is unclear what weight has been attached to this in the calculation of the fine,  I think it is clear that in being neither aggravating nor mitigating, it did not increase or decrease the proposed fining range. \n \n322.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this aspect of matters.  I note, however, the “relevant facts” identified by the Board, in paragraphs 98 of the Article 65 Decision, including in relation to the personal data concerned, as follows: \n \n“Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device. According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location.” \n \n \n323.\tWhile, as noted already in the Draft Decision, it was neither necessary for the purpose of the examination of the Complaint, nor possible from an examination of the relevant privacy policy, to identify the particular categories of personal data undergoing processing, it seems clear that the Board considered the processing to concern a broad range of categories of personal data.  Given the nature of behavioural advertising, it appears to be beyond dispute that the processing of a broad range of personal data is required to be carried out to achieve the objectives of behavioural advertising.  In the circumstances, I proposed to consider this to be an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n324.\tMeta Ireland, in its Final Submissions, submitted that this factor should be considered neutral in circumstances where the views of the EDPB that form the basis of the Commission’s assessment under this heading, in turn, rely on “descriptions of processing that are inaccurate and outside the scope of the Inquiry”.    \n \n325.\tAs already outlined above, the Article 65 Decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, it is not open to the Commission to revisit or otherwise look behind the views expressed and determinations made by the EDPB.  In the circumstances, I remain of the view that this factor ought to be treated as an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(H): THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INFRINGEMENT BECAME KNOWN TO THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY, IN PARTICULAR WHETHER, AND IF SO TO WHAT EXTENT, THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR NOTIFIED THE INFRINGEMENT \n \n326.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, I noted that the subject matter became known to the Commission due to an Inquiry conducted on foot of the Complaint. The subject matter did not give rise to any requirement of notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief is that no infringement is/was occurring.   \n \n327.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  As noted above, the subject matter did not give rise to any requirement of notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief is that no infringement is/was occurring.  Meta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions has confirmed its agreement with the above approach.   In the circumstances, I conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(I): WHERE MEASURES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 58(2) HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ORDERED AGAINST THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR CONCERNED WITH REGARD TO THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER, COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE MEASURES \n \n328.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, I concluded that this criterion is not applicable. \n \n329.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  I note that measures have not previously been ordered against Meta Ireland with regard to the same subject matter.  Meta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions has confirmed its agreement with the above approach.   In the circumstances, I have conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(J): ADHERENCE TO APPROVED CODES OF CONDUCT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 40 OR APPROVED CERTIFICATION MECHANISMS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 42 \n \n330.\tIn the context of the Transparency Infringements, I concluded that this criterion is not applicable. \n \n331.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision has not addressed this particular aspect of matters.  The Commission proposed to consider this factor as neither mitigating nor aggravating in circumstances where nothing arises for assessment under this heading.  Meta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions has confirmed its agreement with the above approach.   In the circumstances, I conclude that this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating. \n \nARTICLE 83(2)(K): ANY OTHER AGGRAVATING OR MITIGATING FACTOR APPLICABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, SUCH AS FINANCIAL BENEFITS GAINED, OR LOSSES AVOIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE INFRINGEMENT \n \n332.\tIn the Preliminary Draft Decision, I considered the following factors in the context of the Transparency Infringements: \n \n•\tMeta Ireland does not charge for the Instagram service. \n \n•\tThe subject matter of the Infringements relates directly to the provision of information in relation to what is, by Meta Ireland’s own admission, its core business model i.e. personalised advertising provided pursuant to a contract with Instagram users. \n \n•\tThe question is therefore whether a more transparent approach to processing operations carried out on foot of that contract would represent a risk to Meta Ireland’s business model. In my view, it would, if existing or prospective users were dissuaded from using the Instagram service by clearer explanations of the processing operations carried out, and their purposes.  \n \n•\tIn my view, the above risk is sufficiently high to justify the conclusion that this lack of transparency has the potential to have resulted in financial benefits for Meta Ireland. \n \n333.\tMeta Ireland however argued that this does not at all propose a financial risk, and argued that no evidence of same has been presented.  Neither I nor Meta Ireland can know, until the contingent event has happened, which one of us is correct in our belief as to the likely impact, on the continued growth of the user base.  Given that any general consideration of this is ultimately involves an element of speculation on both Meta Ireland’s and the Commission’s part, I consider that this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating. \n \n334.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB, paragraphs 435 to 437 Article 65 Decision, record the EDPB’s views that: \n \n“The EDPB recall that financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. \n \nIn the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement. \n \nNonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.” \n \n \n335.\tIn a similar view, paragraph 439 of the Article 65 Decision records that: \n \n“On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.” \n \n \n336.\tDespite specific requests made by the Commission, during the course of the Article 65 deliberations, no directions have been provided by the EDPB, in its Article 65 Decision, as to the manner in which the Commission might seek to ascertain an estimation of: (i) the financial benefit gained from an infringement such as the one under assessment; or (ii) the competitive advantage derived from the infringement.  I note, in this regard, the views previously expressed by the EDPB  that: \n \n“… when deciding on the imposition of corrective measures in general, and fines in particular, “supervisory authorities must assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified.” \n \n \n337.\tIn the absence of directions, the Commission is unable to ascertain an estimation of the matters identified above.  Accordingly, I am unable to take these matters into account for the purpose of this assessment. \n \n338.\tAs before, the Commission separately notes, under this heading, the Board’s view, as set out in the Board’s binding decision 1/2021 (paragraphs 409 to 412, inclusive), that the turnover of the undertaking concerned ought to be taken into account not just for the calculation of the applicable fining “cap” but also for the purpose of assessing the quantum of the administrative fine itself.  This position is further reflected in the Fining Guidelines 04/2022 (see, for example, paragraph 49).  The Commission’s assessment of the undertaking concerned and the applicable turnover figure is detailed elsewhere in the Draft Decision.  While this is not a matter that can properly be classified as either mitigating or aggravating, by reference to the circumstances of the case, I proposed to take the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned into account when determining the quantum of the proposed fine, as set out below.   \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision  \n \n339.\tMeta Ireland, in its Final Submissions, disagreed with the Commission’s proposal to have regard to the turnover of the undertaking concerned in calculating the amount of the fine.   As already noted above, this requirement was previously determined by the EDPB in binding decision 1/2021 and reiterated in the Article 65 Decision.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Commission to disregard this requirement.  Neither is it open to the Commission to treat “Meta Ireland alone” as being the relevant “undertaking” for these purposes. \n \nWHETHER TO IMPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE FINE \n \t \n\t \tThe Transparency Infringements \n \n340.\tI proposed to impose an administrative fine in relation to the Transparency Infringements in circumstances where: \n \n• The infringements are serious in nature. The lack of transparency goes to the heart of data subject rights and risks undermining their effectiveness by not providing transparent information in that regard. While the infringements considered here relate to one lawful basis, it nonetheless concerns vast swathes of personal data impacting millions of data subjects. When such factors are considered, it is clear that the infringements are serious in their gravity.  \nI have taken this into account when determining, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, that the infringements are at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness. \n \n•\tA significant portion of the population of the EEA seems to have been impacted by the Infringements.  I consider this to be an aggravating factor of significant weight. \n \n•\tI note in particular the impact a lack of transparency has on a data subject’s ability to be fully informed about their data protection rights, or indeed about whether in their view they should exercise those rights.  I have taken this into account when determining, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, that the infringements are at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness.  \n \n•\tI have already found that the Infringements were negligent.  While I am not calling into question Meta Ireland’s right to come to a genuine view on this matter, I am taking into account the failure of an organisation of this size to provide sufficiently transparent materials in relation to the core of its business model.  For the avoidance of doubt, and noting the views expressed by the EDPB in its Fining Guidelines 04/2022, that “(a)t best, negligence could be regarded as neutral”, I have taken this into account as a neutral factor. \n \n•\tI note that the Instagram Data Policy and Terms of Use have been amended, and because this is an Inquiry into a particular complaint, the documents being considered are no longer contemporary.  Therefore, I am not attaching significant weight to the question of the duration of the infringement, in circumstances where more recent versions of the relevant documents are outside the scope of the Inquiry.  In the circumstances, and for the avoidance of doubt, I have taken this into account as a neutral factor.  \n \n•\tThe mitigating factor of Meta Ireland’s decision to begin preparation for voluntary compliance on the basis of the views set out in the Preliminary Draft Decision, pending conclusion of the Inquiry. \n \n341.\tOn the basis of the analysis set out above in respect of the nature, gravity and duration of the infringements and the potential number of data subjects affected, I have proposed, by way of the Draft Decision, to impose the following administrative fines: \n \n•\tIn respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, I proposed a fine of between €11.5 million and €14 million. \n \n•\tIn respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, I proposed a fine of between €6.5 million and €9 million.  \n \n342.\tIn determining the quantum of the fines proposed above, I took account of the requirement, set out in Article 83(1) GDPR, for fines imposed to be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” in each individual case.  My view was that, in order for any fine to be “effective”, it must reflect the circumstances of the individual case.  As already discussed above, the Transparency Infringements are serious, both in terms of the extremely large number of data subjects potentially affected, the categories of personal data involved, and the consequences that flow from the failure to comply with the transparency requirements for users. \n \n343.\tIn order for a fine to be “dissuasive”, it must dissuade both the controller/processor concerned as well as other controllers/processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the conduct concerned.   \n \n344.\tAs regards the requirement for any fine to be “proportionate”, this requires the adjustment of the quantum of any proposed fine to the minimum amount necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR.  My view was that the fines proposed above did not exceed what was necessary to enforce compliance with the GDPR, taking into account the size of the Instagram user base, the impact of the Infringements on the effectiveness of the data subject rights enshrined in \nChapter III of the GDPR and the importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR as a whole.   \n \n345.\tAccordingly, my view was that the fines proposed above would, if imposed on Meta Ireland, be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, taking into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry. \n \n346.\tFurther to the circulation of the Draft Decision to the concerned supervisory authorities for the purpose of enabling them to express their views in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR, objections were raised in relation to this aspect of matters by the supervisory authorities of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway.  Having considered the merits of those objections, the EDPB determined as follows: \n \n364. The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect. The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model, the risk of this occurring is all the greater. By bearing the cost of the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment. 365. Though the IE SA touches upon the notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in relation to the proposed fine, there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to explain the modest fine range chosen. Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR, the IE SA does not articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness. In this regard the EDPB recalls that, contrary to Meta IE’s views, the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine. \n \n366. In light of the above, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine. \n \n347.\tI note that the EDPB agreed with the manner in which the Commission originally assessed the circumstances of the Transparency Infringement for the purposes of the Article 83(2) criteria.  That being the case, it seems clear that the EDPB’s instruction, above, concerns my view that the originally proposed fines were effective, proportionate and dissuasive for the purpose of Article 83(1) GDPR.  In other words, the focus of the EDPB’s instruction is the quantum of the fines that were originally proposed by the Article 60 Draft Decision.  I note, in this regard, the EDPB’s instruction that I set out a “significantly” higher fine, in comparison with the upper limit for the originally proposed administrative fines.  By way of guidance, the Article 65 Decision records as follows: \n \n362.\tAccording to the DE, FR, and IT SAs, the proposed fine is not consistent with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited for the same transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR). In particular, the DE SAs point out that ‘’the facts and the seriousness of the infringements in the two cases are no sufficiently different to justify a difference of 85% in the fine imposed’’. The FR and IT SAs also compare with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR). While the EDPB agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-bycase assessment under Article 83 GDPR, the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the DE, FR and IT SAs do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regards to the nature and gravity of the infringements involved. Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter. \n \n363.\tThe DE, FR, IT and NO SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine range is about \n0.03 % of the global annual turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc., which the DE SAs note is about 0.72% of the maximum ceiling provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR. For illustrative purposes also, is the amount of time it would take Meta Platforms, Inc. on average to generate 23 million euros in turnover in 2020, which was about 2 hours and 33 minutes. \n \n348.\tOn the basis of the instruction and guidance set out above, I have decided to impose administrative fines as follows: \n•\tIn respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €70 million and €80 million. \n \n•\tIn respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, I propose a fine of between €60 million and €70 million. \n349.\tI am of the (provisional) view that administrative fines within these ranges would satisfy the requirement, in Article 83(1) GDPR for any administrative fines imposed to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.  In this regard, I have taken account of: \n \na.\tThe purpose of the fines, which is to sanction the infringements of (i) Articles 12(1), 13(1)(c), 5(1)(a) (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) and (ii) Article 6(1) (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) that were found to have occurred (by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision); \n \nb.\tThe requirement for any fine to be effective.  In this regard, I note that the fines proposed above reflect the circumstances of the case, including both the specific elements of the infringement as well as those elements that relate to the controller which committed the infringement, namely its financial position (as required by paragraph 414 of the EDPB’s binding decision 1/2021); \n \nc.\tThe requirement for a genuinely deterrent effect, in terms of discouraging both Meta Ireland and others from committing the same infringement in the future;  \n \nd.\tThe requirement for any fine to be proportionate and to not exceed what is necessary to achieve the stated objective (as recorded at a., above).  I consider that the fines proposed is proportionate to the circumstances of the case, taking into account the gravity of the infringements and all of the elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease (mitigating factors) of the initial assessment as well as the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned.  It also takes account of the views, assessments and instructions of the EDPB, as set out in the Article 65 Decision (and incorporated into this Decision, above).  It also takes account of the fact that the fines will be imposed in addition to an order requiring Meta Ireland to take action to bring its processing into compliance. \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the re-assessment of the administrative fines originally proposed by the Draft Decision, in relation to the Transparency Infringements \n350.\tMeta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions, has challenged the proposed reassessment of the fines corresponding to the Transparency Infringements.  \n \n351.\tInsofar as the relevant submissions express disagreement with matters that have been determined by the EDPB or, otherwise, upon which the EDPB has expressed a view, in the Article 65 Decision, that decision is binding upon the Commission.  Accordingly, it is not open to the Commission to disregard or otherwise look behind any views expressed or instructions given by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision. \n \n352.\tFurthermore, insofar as the relevant submissions restate matters that have already been considered by the Commission (such as Meta Ireland’s view that the Transparency Infringements are “technical in nature”), I do not propose to engage further with such matters. \n \n353.\tMeta Ireland further submitted that the proposed increase is incompatible with Article 83(1) GDPR.  It also notes the inconsistency between the increased fining ranges being proposed and the Commission’s previously expressed view that the lower fining ranges proposed by the Draft Decision were effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  It is important to bear in mind that the Commission’s previous view that the proposed fining ranges were effective, proportionate and dissuasive, has been overtaken by the Article 65 Decision.  The EDPB, in that decision, expressed a range of views and it is not open to the Commission to look behind those views, as appears to be suggested by Meta Ireland. \n \n354.\tAs regards Meta Ireland’s submissions directed to challenging how the increased fining ranges might be said to be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”,  I note that these submissions share a range of common arguments, including: \n•\tSubmissions that it is not appropriate for the Commission to take account of Meta Ireland’s “financial position” and questioning the difference between “financial position” and “turnover” in circumstances where the Commission previously indicated that it had taken Meta Ireland’s turnover into account when assessing the quantum of the originally proposed fining ranges; \n•\tSubmissions concerning the level of the increase proposed by the Commission.  Meta Ireland has submitted, in this regard, that the Commission “has proposed an increase well in excess of the purported instruction of the EDPB “to set out a significantly higher fine amount” in respect of these alleged infringements”.  Meta Ireland has further suggested that: “[i]t appears (although this is not clear) that the [Commission] was influenced in this regard by the EDPB’s comments regarding fines imposed by other supervisory authorities in respect of transparency infringements, namely the WhatsApp and Amazon Decisions.  Without engaging in any factual assessment of these decisions, the EDPB asserts that these cases “show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams.  Moreover, there are similarities with regard to the infringements involved”. \n \n355.\tAs already noted above, the Commission is required, by the Article 65 Decision and Binding Decision 1/2021, to take account of the turnover of the undertaking concerned when quantifying the amount of the proposed administrative fine.  The Commission did so as part of its original assessment, however the EDPB, by way of the Article 65 Decision, instructed the Commission to re-assess quantum on the basis that the proposed amounts were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR.  The Article 65 Decision provides at paragraph 364, for example, that: \n“The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect. The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an \nacceptable cost of doing business. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model, the risk of this occurring is all the greater. By bearing the cost of the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment.” [emphasis added] \n \n356.\tIn the circumstances, it was incumbent on the Commission to re-assess the manner in which account was previously taken of the turnover of the undertaking concerned.  The Commission notes, in this regard, the very significant turnover of the Meta Platforms, Inc. group of companies and considers that the increased fining ranges take appropriate account of that significant level of turnover, as required by the Article 65 Decision.  For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Commission has, first and foremost, addressed its mind to the Article 83 framework when assessing the questions of whether an administrative fine ought to be imposed and, if so, the amount of any such fine.  That ought to be clear from the detailed analysis of the individual circumstances of this Inquiry set out in this Section 9.  Otherwise, the Commission has re-assessed the quantum of its originally proposed fines by reference to the instructions and directions provided by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision.  Any suggestions of comparison with the Amazon or WhatsApp decisions are without foundation. \n \n357.\tHaving taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the views set out in paragraphs 348 and 349, above. \n \nProposed quantum of fining range - the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement \n \n358.\tIn relation to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, my conclusions, further to the Article 83(2) assessment recorded above, are that: \n \n•\tThe infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle)  has been assessed as falling at the upper end of the scale, in terms of seriousness, for the purpose of Article 83(2)(a). \n \n•\tThe seriously negligent character of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement ought, in the particular circumstances of this inquiry, to be taken into account as an aggravating factor of significant weight. \n \n•\tThe degree of responsibility of the controller is to be treated as an aggravating factor, of moderately significant weight. \n \n•\tThe broad range of categories of personal data affected by the infringement ought to be taken into account as an aggravating factor of moderately significant weight. \n \n•\tOtherwise, the assessments of the Article 83(2)(c), 83(2)(e), 83(2)(f), 83(2)(h), 83(2)(i), 83(2)(j) and 83(2)(k) criteria are to be treated as neither mitigating nor aggravating for the purpose of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement. \n359.\tOn the basis of the above, I proposed to impose an (additional) administrative fine of an amount falling within the range of €50 to 60 million, in respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle). \n \n360.\tI expressed the (provisional) view that an administrative fine within this range would satisfy the requirement in Article 83(1) GDPR for any administrative fine imposed to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.  In this regard, I have taken account of: \n \na.\tThe purpose of the fine, which is to sanction the infringement of Article 6(1) (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle) that was found to have occurred (by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision);  \n \nb.\tThe requirement for any fine to be effective. In this regard, the Commission notes that the fine proposed above reflects the circumstances of the case, including both the specific elements of the infringement as well as those elements that relate to the controller which committed the infringement, namely its financial position (as required by paragraph 414 of the EDPB’s binding decision 1/2021); \n \nc.\tThe requirement for a genuinely deterrent effect, in terms of discouraging both Meta Ireland and others from committing the same infringement in the future; and \n \nd.\tThe requirement for any fine to be proportionate and to not exceed what is necessary to achieve the stated objective (as recorded at a., above). The Commission considers that the fine proposed is proportionate to the circumstances of the case, taking into account the gravity of the infringements and all of the elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease (mitigating factors) of the initial assessment as well as the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned. The fine also takes account of the fact that the (additional) fine will be imposed in addition to an order requiring Meta Ireland to take action to bring its processing into compliance. \n \ne.\tI have also taken particular account, in this regard, of the facts that: \n \ni.\tThe EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR was partially based on the lack of transparency (see, for example, paragraphs 126, 129 and 130 of the Article 65 Decision), as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Terms of Use. \n \nii.\tThe EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle was similarly largely based on the lack of transparency (see, for example, paragraphs 224, 225, 228 and 235 of the Article 65 Decision), as regards the information that was presented to the data subject concerning the processing that would be carried out further to the Terms of Use. \n \niii.\tAs already noted, the Draft Decision contains separate proposed findings of infringement of the transparency obligations set out in Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) together with corresponding proposals to exercise corrective powers in the form of an administrative fine and an order to bring processing into compliance. I have taken this previous sanction into account when proposing the fining range set out above so as to avoid the risk of punishing Meta Ireland twice in respect of the same conduct. This factor necessitated a moderately significant reduction in the fine that might otherwise have been imposed, notwithstanding the significant turnover of the undertaking concerned and the outcome of the Article 83(2)(a) assessment, as recorded above. \n \nMeta Ireland’s Final Submissions in response to the assessment of the Article 6(1) infringement for the purpose of Article 83(2), as introduced to this Decision following the adoption of the Article 65 Decision \n \n361.\tMeta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions, disagreed with the above assessments of the Article 6(1) GDPR infringement.  For ease of response, I have summarised the relevant submissions thematically, as follows: \n \nDiscretion of the Commission \n \n362.\tUnder this heading, Meta Ireland submitted, firstly, that “by proposing exponential increases to the administrative fines in respect of the infringements related to Articles 5, 12, and 13 GDPR, (which themselves are unsupported, as explained further at sections 12, 13, and 14 below), the DPC has taken account of the Article 65 Decision and no additional administrative fine is required or warranted in respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR”.   Meta Ireland noted, in this regard, that the Article 65 Decision requires the Commission to impose an administrative fine to “cover” the EDPB’s finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. \n \n363.\tIt submitted, secondly, that the imposition of a fine for the Article 6(1) infringement while also substantially increasing the fines for the Transparency Infringements is disproportionate and unnecessary in circumstances where the infringements are based on the same underlying processing and alleged harm to data subjects.  \n \n364.\tThirdly, it submitted that, just as the Commission has decided not to impose an additional fine in respect of Article 5(1)(a) (fairness principle) GDPR due to the overlapping nature of the infringements, it should similarly decide not to impose an additional fine in relation to the Article 6(1) infringement because this would risk punishing Meta Ireland twice for the same wrongdoing.350  Furthermore, it submitted that it was “particularly inappropriate for the [Commission] to impose three separate and substantial fines in respect of these infringements, having regard to the principle of concurrence of laws. It cannot plausibly be maintained that these infringements are sufficiently distinct to warrant three separate fines in circumstances where the [Commission] itself considers the conduct constituting the alleged Article 6(1) infringement to be so similar to the other infringements that it can incorporate significant elements of the fines assessment by reference”.351 \n \n365.\tThe above submissions are premised upon the misunderstanding that the Commission has discretion, as regards, the imposition of a fine for the Article 6(1) infringement.  The Commission, being subject to a binding decision of the EDPB, has no such discretion.  .  This is clear from the Article 65 Decision itself, in particular paragraphs 410 and 411 which state that: \n \n“the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the [supervisory authorities of Austria, Germany, France, Norway and Sweden] in their objections. The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection. \nSeveral of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.” \n \n \n366.\tIn the circumstances, it is clear that the Commission is required to impose an administrative fine in respect of the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR that was established by the EDPB and, when doing so, to take account of the instructions, deliberations and determinations of the EDPB, as recorded in Section 9.2.4.2.1 of the Article 65 Decision. \n \n367.\tIt is important to note that this instruction (to impose an administrative fine for the Article 6(1) infringement) sits separately to, and alongside, the EDPB’s further instruction that the Commission “set out a significantly higher fine amount” in respect of the Transparency Infringements that were already proposed by way of the Draft Decision.  \n \n368.\tFinally, as regards the Commission’s decision not to impose a separate administrative fine in respect of the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) principle of fairness that was established by the EDPB, the Article 65 Decision specifically afforded the Commission discretion in relation to the manner in which this particular infringement might be addressed by way of a corrective power.  This is clear from paragraph 446 of the Article 65 Decision.  The inclusion of this express discretion is in marked contrast with the absence of any similar discretion in relation to the imposition/increase of administrative fines for the Article 6(1) and Transparency Infringements. \n \nInadequate Rationalisation \n \n369.\tUnder this heading, Meta Ireland submitted that “the reasoning in the Draft Decision in respect of the calculation of the fines is inadequate, such that it is impossible to understand how the proposed fining ranges have been calculated or how the different factors discussed by the DPC have had an impact on the proposed fine and, as a result, to make meaningful submissions in respect of same.”  \n \n370.\tI do not agree that this is the case.  As is evident from the analysis set out above, the Commission has clearly identified the factors that were considered relevant for the purpose of each of the individual Article 83(2) assessments.  Furthermore, the manner in which the relevant factors have been taken into account, e.g. as a mitigating or aggravating factor, as well as the weight that has been attributed to each one has been clearly addressed.   \n \n371.\tThis approach is in line with the Commission’s obligation to provide reasons for its decisions.  While the Commission is required to explain how it arrived at the level of a proposed fine, it is not required to apply such specificity so as to allow a controller or processor to make a precise mathematical calculation of the expected fine . \n \nIncompatibility with Article 83(1) GDPR – Article 6(1) \n \n372.\tMeta Ireland, by way of its Final Submissions, has submitted that the “proposed fine for the Article 6(1) infringement – both individually and taken cumulatively with the other significant administrative fines being proposed in respect of the Transparency Infringements – is inconsistent with the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR”.  \n \n373.\tMeta Ireland further submitted that the proposed fine is “is manifestly excessive and far higher than the minimum amount necessary to be ‘effective’ and ‘dissuasive’, and is therefore not ‘proportionate’”.  \n \n374.\tMeta Ireland, thirdly submitted that the reasoning in the Draft Decision as to why the administrative fines comply with the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR is “wholly inadequate”.  Meta Ireland has added, in this regard, that this has undermined its ability to make meaningful submissions in response to same.  \n \n375.\tI note that, in having detailed my views as to the reasons why I consider the proposed fines to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, I have followed the directions of the EDPB that were set out on this particular matter in its Binding Decision 1/2021357.  Accordingly, I consider that the Commission has adequately addressed this aspect of matters. \n \n376.\tOtherwise, I note that I have already addressed many of the matters raised by Meta Ireland as part of this aspect of its Final Submissions elsewhere in this Decision.  In relation to Meta Ireland’s submissions concerning the “very onerous compliance order requiring significant expenditure of resources”, it is important to recall that the objective sought to be achieved by the compliance order (the remediation of any identified infringements) differs from the objective sought to be achieved by the imposition of an administrative fine (the sanctioning of any identified infringements).  Furthermore, the “significant expenditure of resources” are the resources of Meta Ireland itself, which is, as already noted, an entity with significant resources available to it.  In the circumstances, I do not agree that such matters should, in the circumstances of this particular inquiry, operate to offset the quantum of any proposed fine. \n \n377.\tHaving completed my assessment of whether or not to impose a fine (and of the amount of any such fine), I must now consider the remaining provisions of Article 83 GDPR, with a view to ascertaining if there are any factors that might require the adjustment of the proposed fines. \n \n378.\tHaving taken account of the Final Submissions, I remain of the views set out in paragraph 359, above. \n \n11 OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS \n \nARTICLE 83(3) GDPR \n \n379.\tIn accordance with Article 83(3) GDPR: \n“If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.” \n380.\tAs outlined previously, Meta Ireland’s infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 13(1)(c), and 12(1) GDPR all relate to the same processing operations concerning its processing carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.   \n \n381.\tIn respect of the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, I am mindful of the Commission’s obligations of cooperation and consistency in, inter alia, Articles 60(1) and 63 GDPR and, accordingly, it is necessary to follow the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR which arose following the EDPB Decision relating to IN 18-12-2, an inquiry conducted by the Commission into WhatsApp Ireland Limited’s compliance with Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR.   \n \n382.\tThe relevant passage of the EDPB Decision is as follows: \n \n“315. All CSAs argued in their respective objections that not taking into account infringements other than the “gravest infringement” is not in line with their interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, as this would result in a situation where WhatsApp IE is fined in the same way for one infringement as it would be for several infringements. On the other hand, as explained above, the IE SA argued that the assessment of whether to impose a fine, and of the amount thereof, must be carried out in respect of each individual infringement found  and the assessment of the gravity of the infringement should be done by taking into account the individual circumstances of the case. The IE SA decided to impose only a fine for the infringement of Article 14 GDPR, considering it to be the gravest of the three infringements. \n \n316.\tThe EDPB notes that the IE SA identified several infringements in the Draft Decision for which it specified fines, namely infringements of Article 12, 13 and 14 GDPR, and then applied Article 83(3) GDPR.  \n \n317.\tFurthermore, the EDPB notes that WhatsApp IE agreed with the approach of the IE SA concerning the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR. In its submissions on the objections, WhatsApp IE also raised that the approach of the IE SA did not lead to a restriction of the IE SA’s ability to find other infringements of other provisions of the GDPR or of its ability to impose a very significant fine. WhatsApp IE argued that the alternative interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR suggested by the CSAs is not consistent with the text and structure of Article 83 GDPR and expressed support for the IE SA’s literal and purposive interpretation of the provision. \n \n318.\tIn this case, the issue that the EDPB is called upon to decide is how the calculation of the fine is influenced by the finding of several infringements under Article 83(3) GDPR.  \n \n319.\tArticle 83(3) GDPR reads that if “a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.”  \n \n320.\tFirst of all, it has to be noted that Article 83(3) GDPR is limited in its application and will not apply to every single case in which multiple infringements are found to have occurred, but only to those cases where multiple infringements have arisen from “the same or linked processing operations”. \n \n321.\tThe EDPB highlights that the overarching purpose of Article 83 GDPR is to ensure that for each individual case, the imposition of an administrative fine in respect of an infringement of the GDPR is to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In the view of the EDPB, the ability of SAs to impose such deterrent fines highly contributes to enforcement and therefore to compliance with the GDPR. \n \n322.\tAs regards the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, the EDPB points out that the effet utile principle requires all institutions to give full force and effect to EU law.  The EDPB considers that the approach pursued by the IE SA would not give full force and effect to the enforcement and therefore to compliance with the GDPR, and would not be in line with the aforementioned purpose of Article 83 GDPR. \n \n323.\tIndeed, the approach pursued by the IE SA would lead to a situation where, in cases of several infringements of the GDPR concerning the same or linked processing operations, the fine would always correspond to the same amount that would be identified, had the controller or processor only committed one – the gravest – infringement. The other infringements would be discarded with regard to calculating the fine. In other words, it would not matter if a controller committed one or numerous infringements of the GDPR, as only one single infringement, the gravest infringement, would be taken into account when assessing the fine. \n \n324.\tWith regard to the meaning of Article 83(3) GDPR the EDPB, bearing in mind the views expressed by the CSAs, notes that in the event of several infringements, several amounts can be determined.  However, the total amount cannot exceed a maximum limit prescribed, in the abstract, by the GDPR. More specifically, the wording “amount specified for the gravest infringement” refers to the legal maximums of fines under Articles 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR. The EDPB notes that the Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679   state that the \"occurrence of several different infringements committed together in any particular single case means that the supervisory authority is able to apply the administrative fines at a level which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive within the limit of the gravest infringement\". The guidelines include an example of an infringement of Article 8 and Article 12 GDPR and refer to the possibility for the SA to apply the corrective measure within the limit set out for the gravest infringement, i.e. in the example the limits of Article 83(5) GDPR. \n \n325.\tThe wording “total amount” also alludes to the interpretation described above. The EDPB notes that the legislator did not include in Article 83(3) GDPR that the amount of the fine for several linked infringements should be (exactly) the fine specified for the gravest infringement. The wording “total amount” in this regard already implies that other infringements have to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the fine. This is notwithstanding the duty on the SA imposing the fine to take into account the proportionality of the fine. \n \n326.\tAlthough the fine itself may not exceed the legal maximum of the highest fining tier, the offender shall still be explicitly found guilty of having infringed several provisions and these infringements have to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the final fine that is to be imposed. Therefore, while the legal maximum of the fine is set by the gravest infringement with regard to Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR, other infringements cannot be discarded but have to be taken into account when calculating the fine. \n \n327.\tIn light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the objections raised by the DE SA, FR SA and PT SA with respect to Article 83(3) GDPR and to also take into account the other infringements – in addition to the gravest infringement – when calculating the fine, subject to the criteria of Article 83(1) GDPR of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness.” \n \n383.\tThe impact of this interpretation would be that administrative fine(s) would be imposed cumulatively, as opposed to imposing only the proposed fine for the gravest infringement.  The only applicable limit for the total fine imposed, under this interpretation, would be the overall “cap”.  By way of example, in a case of multiple infringements, if the gravest infringement was one which carried a maximum administrative fine of 2% of the turnover of the undertaking, the cumulative fine imposed could also not exceed 2% of the turnover of the undertaking. \n \n384.\tMeta Ireland has argued that the above interpretation and application of Article 83(3) GDPR is incorrect and/or should not be applied because: the EDPB decision is incorrect as a matter of law and is, in any event, not binding on the Commission; even if the decision were binding on the Commission, it does not require that the Commission impose administrative fines in the manner proposed; the Commission has not had regard to the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in Article 83(1) GDPR when determining the total cumulative proposed fine; and no decision on the correct interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR should be made prior to the determination of a pending application by WhatsApp Ireland, pursuant to Article 263 TFEU, before the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union, to annul the EDPB Decision (“the Annulment Proceedings”).    \n \n385.\tIn this regard, Meta Ireland submitted that the EDPB Decision is not binding on the Commission. A number of legal arguments are made in this regard, including that binding decisions of the EDPB only apply to specific individual cases (as set out in article 65(1) GDPR)  and that only the CJEU can issue binding decisions on matters of EU law.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission has not expressed the view, nor does it hold the view, that the EDPB Decision is legally binding on it in this Inquiry and/or generally. The Commission is nonetheless, in this regard, bound by a number of provisions of the GDPR and the real question that arises in this context is the extent to which the Commission should have regard to the EDPB’s approach. \n \n386.\tThe Commission is bound by Article 60(1) GDPR, which states in the imperative that “the lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an endeavour to reach consensus” [emphasis added]. The Commission is similarly required to cooperate with other supervisory authorities, pursuant to Article 63 GDPR. Meta Ireland has argued that these obligations relate only to specific cases where a dispute has arisen.  Moreover, it submits that the EDPB’s function in ensuring correct application of the GDPR is provided for instead in Article 70(1) GDPR, such as through issuing opinions and guidelines.  \n \n387.\tIt is not the position of the Commission that the EDPB in and of itself has the power to issue decisions of general application that bind supervisory authorities. The issue is not the powers or functions of the EDPB, but rather the legal responsibility of the Commission to the concerned supervisory authorities, who in themselves happen to be constituent members of the EDPB. In this regard, assistance is provided in the interpretation of the Commission’s duties under Article 60(1) GDPR by Recital 123, which states that “…supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the Union…”. The Commission’s view is that the duty to cooperate and ensure consistency that is placed on it by the GDPR would be rendered ineffective were it not to ensure, to the best of its ability, such interpretations were applied consistently. \n \n388.\tThe alternative scenario, as proposed by Meta Ireland, would result in entrenched interpretations being consistently advanced by individual supervisory authorities. The consequence would be inevitable dispute resolution procedures under Article 65 GDPR, and the issuing of a binding decision once again applying an alternative interpretation to the specific facts at hand that had already been comprehensively addressed in a previous dispute resolution procedure. Such a scenario would deprive the duties to cooperate and act consistently of almost any meaning. In the Commission’s view, such an interpretation would therefore be contrary to the principle of effet utile. This is, as has been set out, a distinct issue from the legal powers or functions of the EDPB itself. \n \n389.\tMeta Ireland asserted that the EDPB Decision “did not direct the [Commission] to impose separate fines in respect of each infringement and to then add those fines together”, but rather that the final amount should be considered in accordance with the requirements that the fine be effective, proportionate and dissuasive pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR.   I further note Meta Ireland’s submission that overlap between the infringements should be taken into account, in this regard.  It goes on to argue that as there is “…significant – if not complete – overlap between the infringements”,  the fine is contrary to the EU law principles of proportionality, ne bis in idem and concurrence of laws.  \n \n390.\tMeta Ireland further alleged that the “Commission does [sic] engage in any meaningful assessment of whether the total fine proposed in the Inquiry is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” as required by Article 83(1) GDPR”.   In essence, it is Meta Ireland’s view that the proposed fines, either individually or cumulatively, are disproportionate to the circumstances of the case where Meta Ireland had a differing interpretation of its transparency obligations in good faith, and Meta Ireland is committed to “engaging with the Commission and dedicating significant resources to updating its Data Policy to take account of the Commission’s views and concerns”.   I have outlined my views on this matter in the concluding paragraphs of Section 10. \n \n391.\tAdditionally, Meta Ireland has argued that my approach to imposing cumulative fines in this Inquiry is a “flawed application” of Decision 1/2021 on the basis that “Decision 1/2021 did not direct the Commission to impose separate fines in respect of each infringement and to then add those fines together”.   In particular, Meta Ireland alleged that the “fine being proposed essentially imposed two fines in [sic]Meta Ireland for what is essentially the same set of facts and the same alleged infringement”  which “is inconsistent with principles regarding the concurrence of laws”.  In response to this, it is my view that the failure to provide required information, and the failure to set out required information in a transparent manner, are entirely different wrongs. The legislator has provided for two distinct requirements, and each individual requirement has been infringed by Meta Ireland. For these reasons, I do not accept this submission.  Similarly, the Commission is not applying a new and retroactive view of wrongdoing to the conduct in a manner envisaged by principle of concurrence of laws. It is simply determining the proper interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR. This has no impact on the Commission’s detailed consideration of Meta Ireland’s submissions on the separate and more general question of the appropriate penalty. \n \n392.\tMeta Ireland also argued that the taking into account of the undertaking’s turnover is incorrect as a matter of law, as it is not set out as a factor in Article 83(2) GDPR.   In this regard, the Commission relies on its existing analysis of its obligations to cooperate with the concerned supervisory authorities and apply the GDPR consistently. For the same reasons provided to support \nthe Commission’s decision to apply the EDPB Decision’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in general, the Commission intends to maintain this consideration of the undertaking’s turnover. In relation to Meta Ireland’s submissions as to the appropriate turnover to be considered,  this is addressed below. \n \n393.\tIn this Inquiry, the gravest infringement is that of the failure to provide information on data processing carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in contravention of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR.  The associated maximum possible fine for this infringement under Article 83(5) GDPR is 4% of the turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc. (as noted above, Instagram is wholly owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.).  It is further to be noted that the EDPB’s Decision, from which I quoted above, also directed the Commission to take account of the undertaking’s turnover in the calculation of the fine amounts and I therefore factor that turnover figure below into my calculations of the individual infringement fining ranges. \n \n394.\tFor the sake of completeness, I note that Meta Ireland reiterated its concerns as part of its Final Submissions. 374  I have already addressed the subject-matter of those concerns above.  \n \nARTICLE 83(5) GDPR \n \n395.\tTurning, finally, to Article 83(5) GDPR, I note that this provision operates to limit the maximum amount of any fine that may be imposed in respect of certain types of infringement, as follows: \n \n“Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher: \n… \n(b) the data subjects’ rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22; …” \n \n396.\tIn order to determine the applicable fining “cap”, it is first necessary to consider whether or not the fine is to be imposed on “an undertaking”. Recital 150 clarifies, in this regard, that: \n \n“Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes.” \n \n397.\tAccordingly, when considering a respondent’s status as an undertaking, the GDPR requires me to do so by reference to the concept of “undertaking”, as that term is understood in a competition law context. In this regard, the CJEU has established that: \n \n“an undertaking encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed”.    \n \n398.\tThe CJEU has held that a number of different enterprises could together comprise a single economic unit where one of those enterprises is able to exercise decisive influence over the behaviour of the others on the market.  Such decisive influence may arise, for example, in the context of a parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary.  Where an entity (such as a subsidiary) does not independently decide upon its own conduct on the market, but carries out, in all material respects, the instructions given to it by another entity (such as a parent), this means that both entities constitute a single economic unit and a single undertaking for the purpose of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  The ability, on the part of the parent company, to exercise decisive influence over the subsidiary’s behaviour on the market, means that the conduct of the subsidiary may be imputed to the parent company, without having to establish the personal involvement of the parent company in the infringement.  \n \n399.\tIn the context of Article 83 GDPR, the concept of “undertaking” means that, where there is another entity that is in a position to exercise decisive influence over the controller/processor’s behaviour on the market, then they will together constitute a single economic entity and a single undertaking.  Accordingly, the relevant fining “cap” will be calculated by reference to the turnover of the undertaking as a whole, rather than the turnover of the controller or processor concerned. \n \n400.\tIn order to ascertain whether a subsidiary determines its conduct on the market independently, account must be taken of all the relevant factors relating to the economic, organisational and legal links which tie the subsidiary to the parent company, which may vary from case to case.  \n \n401.\tThe CJEU has, however, established that, where a parent company has a 100% shareholding in a subsidiary, it follows that: the parent company is able to exercise decisive influence over the conduct of the subsidiary; and a rebuttable presumption arises that the parent company does in fact exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary.378   \n \n402.\tThe CJEU has also established that, in a case where a company holds all or almost all of the capital of an intermediate company which, in turn, holds all or almost all of the capital of a subsidiary of its group, there is also a rebuttable presumption that that company exercises a decisive influence over the conduct of the intermediate company and indirectly, via that company, also over the conduct of that subsidiary.  \n \n403.\tThe General Court has further held that, in effect, the presumption may be applied in any case where the parent company is in a similar situation to that of a sole owner as regards its power to exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of its subsidiary.   This reflects the position that: \n \n“… the presumption of actual exercise of decisive influence is based, in essence, on the premise that the fact that a parent company holds all or virtually all the share capital of its subsidiary enables the Commission to conclude, without supporting evidence, that that parent company has the power to exercise a decisive influence over the subsidiary without there being any need to take into account the interests of other shareholders when adopting strategic decisions or in the day-to-day business of that subsidiary, which does not determine its own market conduct independently, but in accordance with the wishes of that parent company … ” \n \n404.\tWhere the presumption of decisive influence has been raised, it may be rebutted by the production of sufficient evidence that shows, by reference to the economic, organisational and legal links between the two entities, that the subsidiary acts independently on the market.   \n \n405.\tIt is important to note that “decisive influence”, in this context, refers to the ability of a parent company to influence, directly or indirectly, the way in which its subsidiary organises its affairs, in a corporate sense, for example, in relation to its day-to-day business or the adoption of strategic decisions.  While this could include, for example, the ability to direct a subsidiary to comply with all applicable laws, including the GDPR, in a general sense, it does not require the parent to have the ability to determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data by its subsidiary. \n \n406.\tAs noted above, within the European Region, the Instagram service is provided by a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. known as Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook Ireland Limited) (referred to as “Meta Ireland” or “Facebook” in this Decision).  Meta Ireland’s ultimate parent is \nMeta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook, Inc.).   I have had regard to Meta Ireland’s Director’s \nReport and Financial Statements for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2020, which are available from the Companies Registration Office and are dated September 2021.  The Director’s Report and Financial Statements describe the relationship between Meta Ireland and Meta Platforms, Inc. as follows: \n \n“Facebook Ireland Limited is wholly owned by Facebook International Operations Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. Its ultimate holding company and controlling party is Facebook, Inc., a company incorporated in the United States of America”.  \n \n407.\tThe Director’s Report and Financial Statement also state the following: \n \n“At 31 December 2020, the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook International Operations Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland, its registered office being 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2. \n \nThe ultimate holding company and ultimate controlling party is Facebook, Inc., a company incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America. The ultimate holding company and controlling party of the smallest and largest group of which the company is a member, and for which consolidated financial statements are drawn up, is Facebook, \nInc.”.  \n \nI note, in this connection, that the same position was stated in Meta Ireland’s Directors’ Reports and Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2019 (dated December 2020) and 31 December 2018 (dated November 2019). \n \n408.\tOn this basis, it is my understanding that Meta Ireland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Facebook International Operations Limited; Facebook International Operations Limited is wholly owned and controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc.; and, as regards any intermediary companies in the corporate chain, between Meta Ireland and Meta Platforms, Inc., it is assumed, by reference to the statement at Note 24 of the Notes to the Financial Statements (quoted above) that the “ultimate holding company and controlling party of the smallest and largest group of which [Meta Ireland] is a member … is Facebook, Inc.”. It is therefore assumed that Meta Ireland, Inc. is in a similar situation to that of a sole owner as regards its power to (directly or indirectly) exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of Meta Ireland.   \n \n409.\tIt seemed therefore at the time of preparing the Decision, that the corporate structure of the entities concerned is such that Meta Platforms, Inc. is in a position to exercise decisive influence over Meta Ireland’s behaviour on the market.  Accordingly, I considered that a rebuttable presumption arose to the effect that Meta Platforms, Inc. does in fact exercise a decisive influence over the conduct of Meta Ireland on the market. \n \n410.\tIf this presumption is not rebutted, it would mean that Meta Platforms, Inc. and Meta Ireland constitute a single economic unit and therefore form a single undertaking within the meaning of Article 101 TFEU.  Consequently, the relevant fining “cap” for the purpose of Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR, would fall to be determined by reference to the consolidated turnover of the group of companies headed by  Meta Platforms, Inc.  Meta Ireland has made submissions in an attempt to rebut the presumption of decisive influence. \n \n411.\tIn this regard, Meta Ireland submitted that the presumption of decisive influence on the market does not translate into a data protection context without considering what “behaviour on the market” means in a data protection context.  It argued that this analysis should focus instead on the entity that has the decision-making capacity in the context of data protection matters, rather than matters relating to the market in general as is the case in competition law.386  I do not agree with this assessment for three reasons.  \n \n412.\tFirst, the suggested approach (involving an assessment of where the decision-making power lies, in relation to the processing of personal data) is effectively a replication of the assessment that must be undertaken at the outset of the inquiry process, the outcome of which determines (i) the party/parties to which the inquiry should be addressed; and (ii) (in cross border processing cases) the supervisory authority with jurisdiction to conduct the inquiry. Given the consequences that flow from this type of assessment, it would not be appropriate for this assessment to be conducted at the decision-making stage of an inquiry. \n \n413.\tSecond, the suggested approach could not be applied equally in each and every case. Where, for example, the presumption of decisive influence has been raised in the context of a cross-border processing case where one of the entities under assessment is outside of the EU, an assessment of that entity’s ability to exercise decisive influence over the respondent’s data processing activities would likely exceed the scope of Article 3 GDPR. Such a scenario risks undermining the Commission’s ability to comply with its obligation, pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR, to ensure that the imposition of fines, in each individual case, is “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”. \n \n414.\tThird, “behaviour on the market” has a meaning normally ascribed to it in EU competition law. In summary, “behaviour on the market” describes how an entity behaves and conducts its affairs in the context of the economic activity in which it engages. Such behaviour will include matters such \nas the policies and procedures it implements, the marketing strategy it pursues, the terms and conditions attaching to any products or services it delivers, its pricing structures, etc. I therefore can see no basis in law, in Meta Ireland’s submissions or otherwise, to deviate from this wellestablished principle as set out both in the GDPR, other provisions of EU law and the jurisprudence of the CJEU. \n \n415.\tApplying the above to Article 83(5) GDPR, I first note that, in circumstances where the fine is being imposed on an “undertaking”, a fine of up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year may be imposed. I note, in this regard, that Meta Platforms, Inc. reported the generation of revenue in the amount of $117.929billion in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021.     That being the case, I am satisfied that the fine proposed above does not exceed the applicable fining “cap” prescribed by Article 83(5) GDPR. \n \nSUMMARY OF ENVISAGED ACTION \n \n416.\tI therefore decide to exercise the following corrective powers: \n \n417.\tAn order is hereby made, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, requiring Meta Ireland to bring processing into compliance (“the Order”) within a period of three months commencing on the day following the date of service, on Meta Ireland, of this Decision.  More specifically, the Order: \n \na.\tfirstly, requires Meta Ireland to bring the Data Policy and Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards information provided on: (i) data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as well as (ii) data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of the Meta Ireland service, in accordance with the principles set out in this Decision; and \n \nb.\tsecondly, requires Meta Ireland to take the necessary action to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising (“the Processing”), in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use, into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR in accordance with the conclusion reached by the EDPB, as recorded at paragraphs 132 and 133 of the Article 65 Decision.  More specifically, in this regard, Meta Ireland is required to take the necessary action to address the EDPB’s finding that Facebook is not entitled to carry out the Processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, taking into account the analysis and views expressed by the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 of the Article 65 Decision.  Such action may include, but is not limited to, the identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis, in Article 6(1) GDPR, for the Processing together with the implementation of any necessary measures, as might be required to satisfy the conditionality associated with that/those alternative legal basis/bases. \n \n418.\tAn administrative fine is hereby imposed, pursuant to Articles 58(2)(i) and 83 GDPR, addressed to Meta Ireland, in the amount of €180 million.  For the avoidance of doubt, that fine reflects the infringements that were found to have occurred, as follows: \n \na.\tIn respect of the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the processing operations carried out in purported reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR, a fine in the amount of €70 million is hereby imposed. \n \nb.\tIn respect of the failure to provide the information that was provided on the processing operations carried out in purported reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR, a fine in the amount of €60 million is hereby imposed. \n \nc.\tIn respect of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR (and taking into account the infringement of the Article 5(1)(a) fairness principle), a fine in the amount of €50 million is hereby imposed. \n \n419.\tMeta Ireland has the right of an effective remedy as against this Decision, the details of which have been provided separately. \n \nThis Decision is addressed to: \n \nMeta Platforms Ireland Limited 4 Grand Canal Square \nGrand Canal Harbour \nDublin 2 \n \n \nDated the 31st day of December 2022 \n \n \nDecision-Maker for the Commission: \n \n[sent electronically, without signature] \n \n_______________________________________ \nHelen Dixon \nCommissioner for Data Protection \n \t  \nAppendix 1 – Schedule 1 \n\t1 \tINTRODUCTION  \na. Purpose of this Document \n \n1.\tThis document is the Schedule referred in the Draft Decision.  This Schedule forms part of the Decision and, accordingly, must be read in conjunction with the Decision.   \n \n2.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Schedule is a proposed integral and operative part of the Decision for the purposes of Article 60 and 65 GDPR.  The previous division of material into two documents is entirely a structural choice, so as to enable a more exclusive focus on the substantive Complaint in the main document, while dealing with matters of a more procedural nature in this Schedule.  It has been incorporated into the Decision itself as part of the finalisation process, prior to adoption. \n \n\t2 \tCHRONOLOGY, PROCEDURAL AND SCOPE MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE INQUIRY  \na. Procedural Background to the Inquiry \n \n3.\tA complaint was lodged with the Belgian DPA on 25 May 2018, the date on which the GDPR came into operation, by NOYB, a verein (or association) under Austrian law, in respect of the processing of certain personal data by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (“Meta Ireland”), then known as Facebook Ireland Limited (“Facebook”),  in the context of the Instagram service (the “Complaint”).  The Complaint was lodged on behalf of a named Data Subject (the “Named Data Subject” or the “Data Subject”) in accordance with Article 80 GDPR.  In general terms, the Complaint focussed on the requirement that (existing) registered users must accept the Instagram Terms of Use to access that service.  In addition, the Complaint concerned the transparency of the information provided to Instagram users in respect of the legal basis of that processing.  The Complaint was made against Meta Ireland on the basis that NOYB considered Meta Ireland to be the data controller in respect of the Instagram service. \n \n4.\tThe Complaint was transferred to the Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) from the Belgian DPA on 31 May 2018.  The Commission commenced an inquiry into this matter on 20 August 2018.  \nThe Commission designated an investigator (the “Investigator”) to consider the issues raised in the Complaint and prepare a draft inquiry report (the “Draft Report”) which was issued to the parties on 20 May 2020.  Following submissions from the parties, the Investigator also produced a final version of the inquiry report (the “Final Report”) which was issued to the parties on 18 January 2021.  In considering the matters within this Complaint, I have relied on the facts as determined by the Investigator in the Final Report.  I have also had regard to the Investigator’s views as set out in the Final Report and the entirety of the file relating to this matter. \n \n5.\tTaking account of the above, I prepared a preliminary version of this Draft Decision and Schedule (the “Preliminary Draft”) which set out my provisional views and findings in this matter, as the decisionmaker, in relation to (i) whether or not an infringement of the GDPR has occurred/is occurring, and (ii) the envisaged action to be taken by the Commission in respect of same.  The Preliminary Draft was circulated to both NOYB and Meta Ireland (collectively the “Parties”) on 23 December 2021.  I received submissions from both Parties on 4 February 2022 and, in finalising the Draft Decision, I carefully considered these submissions and amended the Preliminary Draft accordingly.   \n \n6.\tOn 1 April 2022, the Draft Decision was submitted by the Commission to other concerned supervisory authorities (the “CSAs”, each one being a “CSA”) (within the meaning of Article 4(22) GDPR), for their views, pursuant to Article 60 GDPR.  The cross-border processing under examination in this Inquiry was such that all other EU/EEA supervisory authorities (“SAs, each one being an “SA”) were engaged as supervisory authorities concerned (“CSAs”) for the purpose of the cooperation process outlined in Article 60(3) of the GDPR.  In response, the following CSAs raised objections to the Draft Decision: \n \na.\tThe French SA (the “FR SA”) raised an objection on 28 April 2022; \nb.\tThe Swedish SA (the “SE SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; \nc.\tThe Austrian SA (the “AT SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; \nd.\tThe Hungarian SA (the “HU SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022;  \ne.\tThe Finnish SA (the “FI SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; \nf.\tThe German SAs (the “DE SAs”) raised an objection, submitted by the Hamburg DPA on 29 \nApril 2022;  \ng.\tThe Italian SA (the “IT SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; \nh.\tThe Norwegian SA (the “NO SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; \ni.\tThe Dutch SA (the “NL SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022; and \nj.\tThe Spanish SA (the “ES SA”) raised an objection on 29 April 2022. \n \n7.\tIn addition, the following comments were exchanged: \n \na.\tThe Danish SA (the “DK SA”)made a comment on 29 April 2022; \nb.\tThe Slovenian SA (the “SI SA”)made a comment on 29 April 2022; and  \nc.\tThe Hungarian SA (the “HU SA”) made a comment on 29 April 2022. \n \n8.\tHaving considered the matters raised, the Commission, by way of a composite response memorandum dated 1 July 2022, set out its responses together with the compromise positions that it proposed to take in response to the various objections and comments.  Ultimately, it was not possible to reach consensus with the CSAs on the subject-matter of the objections and, accordingly, the Commission determined that it would not follow them. That being the case, the Commission referred the objections \nto the Board for determination pursuant to the Article 65(1)(a) dispute resolution mechanism.  In advance of doing so, the Commission invited Meta Ireland to exercise its right to be heard on all of the material that the Commission proposed to put before the Board.  Meta Ireland exercised its right to be heard by way of its submissions dated 9 August 2022 (the “Article 65 Submissions”). The Board adopted its Article 65 Decision on 5 December 2022 and notified it to the Commission and all other CSAs on 8 December 2022.  As per Article 65(1), the Board’s decision is binding upon the Commission.  \nAccordingly, and as required by Article 65(6) of the GDPR, the Commission has now amended its Draft Decision, by way of this Decision, in order to take account of the Board’s determination of the various objections from the CSAs which it deemed to be “relevant and reasoned” for the purpose of Article 4(24) of the GDPR.  As part of the amendment process, Meta Ireland was invited to exercise its right to be heard in relation to any matters in relation to which the Commission was required to make a final determination or, otherwise, exercise its own discretion.  Meta Ireland exercised its right to be heard by way of its submissions furnished under cover of letter dated 19 December 2022 (“the Final Submissions”). \n \nb. Legal Basis of the Decision \n \n9.\tThe Investigator in this case conducted the Inquiry under section 110 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (the “2018 Act”). \n \n10.\tThe decision-making process for inquiries conducted by the Commission is outlined in section 113(2)(a) of the 2018.  Additionally, section 113(3)(a) of the Act requires that the Commission must: consider the information obtained during the Inquiry; decide whether an infringement is occurring or has occurred; and if so, decide on the envisaged action (if any) to be taken in relation to the data controller.  This function is performed by me in my role as the decision-maker.  In so doing, I have carried out an independent assessment of all of the materials provided to me by the Investigator.   \n \n11.\tAs stated above, the Inquiry was commenced pursuant to section 110 of the 2018 Act.  By way of background in this regard, under Part 6 of the 2018 Act, the Commission has the power to commence an inquiry on several bases, including on foot of a complaint, or of its own volition.   \n \n12.\tI note that the Investigator, in his consideration of the material gathered during the initial stages of the Inquiry, was satisfied that Meta Ireland was a data controller in respect of the Instagram service.   The Investigator was also satisfied that the Commission was the lead supervisory authority (the “LSA”) as set out in the GDPR for the purposes of this matter on the basis that (i) Meta Ireland has its main establishment (for the purposes of the GDPR) in Ireland and (ii) that the processing at issue in the Complaint constitutes cross-border processing.   My consideration of these matters is below. \n \nc. Referral by the Belgium DPA \n \n13.\tThe Complaint was transferred to the Commission on the basis that the Commission was likely the LSA on the basis that (i) the Complaint concerns cross-border processing and (ii) Meta Ireland, as the data controller for the Instagram service, has its main establishment in Ireland.  As I have noted, the Commission assessed the Complaint and, as the LSA, commenced the Inquiry under section 110 of the 2018 Act on 20 August 2018.  The Parties were also notified of the commencement of the Inquiry on 20 August 2018. \n \nd. Status of NOYB \n \n14.\tAs stated above, the Complaint was lodged by NOYB to the Belgian DPA on behalf of the Named Data Subject.  For completeness, I note that the written Complaint provided a Belgian work address for the Named Data Subject.   Pursuant to Article 77 GDPR, an individual may lodge a complaint to any supervisory authority in respect of processing which that individual considers may amount to an infringement(s) of the GDPR.   In this context, NOYB is acting as a representative of a named individual in accordance with Article 80 GDPR, which states that: \n \n“The data subject shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects’ rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf…” \n \n15.\tFor the purposes of assessing compliance with Article 80 GDPR, it is necessary to assess whether NOYB was a properly constituted not-for-profit body with objectives in the public interest and that was actively engaged in “the field of the protection of data subject rights”.  The Investigator consulted NOYB’s website (www.noyb.eu) and the Austrian Central Registry of Associations in his assessment of whether NOYB was a validly constituted non-profit entity.   The Investigator confirmed that NOYB was a “verein” (association) in Austrian law and had been formed prior to the date of the Complaint.   He also affirmed that Point 1 of NOYB’s Articles of Association stated that the association’s aims included the “protection and promotion of data protection rights, consumer rights, and the right to freedom of expression”  and that NOYB’s website is active in providing commentary and information \non campaigns in respect of data protection matters.   On the basis of these factors, he was satisfied that the criteria set out in Article 80 had been complied with. \n \n16.\tHaving regard to the Investigator’s assessment of this issue and NOYB’s Articles of Association, I am satisfied that that NOYB appears to be a non-profit body that is validly constituted in Austrian law, with objectives in the public interest and is active in the field of data protection. Nonetheless, I note in this regard that a formal determination as to whether NOYB is validly constituted as a matter of Austrian law is outside the scope of the Commission.    \n \n17.\tIt is also necessary to consider whether NOYB has been mandated by the Named Data Subject in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 80(1) GDPR.  First, I note that a document titled “Assignment of Representation” was annexed to the Complaint.   This document contains the name, place of work and signature of the Named Data Subject.  While the mandate is undated, it clearly refers to the subject matter of the Complaint as it states that the Named Data Subject mandates NOYB:  \n \n“to represent me in their case against Facebook Ireland Ltd over my forced consent to the updated privacy policy of Instagram that I clicked on to in May 2018. \n \nIn particular, I mandate noyb to present me and enforce my rights, arising in the context of the aforementioned case, by lodging a complaint before the competent supervisory authority and to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 79 of the GDPR on my behalf, including taking any actions necessary to enforce those rights”.  \n \n18.\tIn submissions on the Draft Report, NOYB stated that it “is not limited in any respect when representing the complainant [and] … the Complainant confirms that he endorses all submissions provided by noyb in the course of the present procedure”.   While I agree that an entity mandated under Article 80 GDPR has certain discretion in formulating the scope of the initial complaint, I do not accept that the entity has unlimited powers to determine the direction of the resulting inquiry.  Rather, it is my view that the nature of a mandate for the purposes of Article 80 GDPR cannot be altered post hoc after the complaint has been launched.  . \n \n19.\tI am satisfied that, on a literal interpretation of the “Assignment of Representation”, NOYB has been given the authority to represent the Named Data Subject in relation to possible infringement(s) arising in the context of the updated (i.e. last revised on 19 April 2018) Instagram Terms of Use and/or Data Policy. \n \n20.\tFor completeness, I note Meta Ireland’s confirmation that the Named Data Subject is a registered user of the Instagram service.   I am therefore satisfied that the processing at issue relates to the Named Data Subject as required by Article 77 GDPR. \n \n21.\tAccordingly, on the basis of the above, I am satisfied that NOYB was mandated by the Named Data Subject in accordance with the requirements of Article 80 GDPR. \n \ne. Procedural Conduct of the Inquiry \n \n22.\tAs set out above, the Inquiry was commenced on 20 August 2018 for the purposes of examining and assessing the circumstances surrounding the Complaint as referred to the Commission by the Belgian DPA, with a view to ultimately facilitating a decision under section 113(2)(a) of the Act. \n \n23.\tThe Commission commenced an Inquiry into the matters complained of as it formed the view that one or more provisions of the GDPR and/or 2018 Act may have been contravened by Meta Ireland in respect of processing in the context of the Instagram service.   The Parties were notified on 20 August 2018 that the Inquiry had been commenced.   In the Notice of Commencement issued to Meta Ireland, the Commission included (1) a series of questions for Meta Ireland and (2) a copy of the Complaint, explaining that the scope of the Inquiry was limited to same.  Following clarification, Meta Ireland responded to these questions by way of correspondence dated 28 September 2018, including several appendices. \n \n24.\tThe Investigator contacted NOYB by letter on 23 November 2018 and outlined the scope of the Inquiry.  NOYB responded on 3 December 2018 and outlined a number of procedural concerns, including allegations of delay and bias on the part of the Commission, a failure of the Commission to respect fair procedures and disagreements as to the Investigator’s view on the scope of the Complaint.  The Investigator responded to these concerns by letter dated 16 January 2019, strongly refuting these claims.  In addition, a phone call between the Investigator and a representative of NOYB  took place on 26 January 2019 to further address these allegations.  \n \n25.\tThe Investigator wrote to Meta Ireland on 30 January 2019 to outline his views as to the scope of the Complaint and afford Meta Ireland the opportunity to provide submissions on the issues raised.  This outline mirrored that which was communicated to NOYB on 23 November 2018.  In a response dated 5 February 2019, Meta Ireland raised a number of procedural questions, in particular in respect of the mechanisms of the Article 60 process and the status of Meta Ireland’s submissions dated 28 September 2018.  In this regard, Meta Ireland also sought clarity on the confidentiality of the process and the extent to which information would be shared with other supervisory authorities. \n \n26.\tThe Investigator responded to Meta Ireland’s procedural questions on 8 February 2019, confirming that Meta Ireland’s submissions dated 28 September 2018 would be considered but only insofar as the submissions were relevant to the scope of the Complaint.  The Investigator further stated that Meta Ireland’s queries as to confidentiality would be addressed by way of separate communication.  In an email dated 15 February 2019, Meta Ireland stated that it considered that the majority of its submissions dated 28 September 2018 fell outside the scope identified by the Investigator.  In addition, Meta Ireland requested an extension of two days for submissions on the issues raised.  In response, by email dated 15 February 2019, the Investigator granted the extension and requested that Meta Ireland identify, with specificity, the material in the submissions dated 28 September 2018, which it considered to be out of scope.  \n \n27.\tMeta Ireland sent its second set of submissions on 22 February 2019; this set of submissions related to the scope as identified by the Investigator.  Meta Ireland included a marked-up copy of its submissions dated 28 September 2018, indicating which aspects of the submissions it considered to be (1) out of scope and/or (2) confidential. \n \n28.\tThe Investigator provided an update to NOYB on 26 February 2019, informing NOYB that Meta Ireland had made submissions on 22 February 2019 and that the Commission was presently considering the confidentiality of same.  NOYB replied on 27 February 2019 and expressed concern that Meta Ireland’s submissions could be considered confidential and to “fundamentally object to any information in this procedure being shielded from us [as the Complainant]”.  NOYB expressed concern that the submissions would be redacted and sought clarification on the role of the Belgian DPA.  In addition, NOYB proactively offered to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  NOYB sought an update on the Inquiry on 23 March 2019. \n \n29.\tThe Investigator wrote to NOYB on 28 March 2019, outlining the next steps in the inquiry process and informing NOYB that the material received in the course of the Inquiry would be provided to the Parties as annexes to the Draft Report.  The Investigator provided an update as to the scope of the Complaint, reiterating the position he expressed in the letter to NOYB on 23 November 2018.  In a short phone call with the Investigator on 1 April 2019, NOYB noted its disagreement as regards the procedural steps outlined by the Commission. \n \n30.\tNOYB responded on 19 April 2019 by way of letter.  In this response, NOYB expressed concern that the GDPR “does not foresee the direct engagement with the Data Protection Commission” as the Complaint had been lodged with the Belgian DPA.  NOYB further stated that, on their understanding of fair procedures, the relevant parties must be able to “review the facts that were excluded from the evidence” and queried whether any information received in the course of the Inquiry could be considered confidential.  In addition, NOYB made further submissions on the scope of the Complaint.  \n \n31.\tThe Investigator provided additional information on the next steps (mirroring the information provided to NOYB on 19 April 2019) to Meta Ireland by way of letter dated 5 June 2019.  The Investigator also informed Meta Ireland that material collected in the course of the Inquiry which was relevant to the substance of the Complaint would be shared with the Parties when the Draft Report would be shared with same.  He further noted that Meta Ireland would be provided the opportunity at another date to make submissions in respect of the disclosure of specific information to NOYB.  Meta Ireland wrote to the Commission on 12 June 2019, reaffirming its earlier position that it be afforded the opportunity to make submissions as to confidentiality and/or commercial sensitivity prior to any material prepared by Meta Ireland being shared with NOYB. \n \n32.\tOn 24 February 2020, NOYB wrote to the Investigator and raised a number of procedural issues, including allegations of delay, “unwieldy” procedures and a failure to respect procedural rights by not sharing the materials with NOYB.  The Investigator responded on 23 March 2020 and noted that NOYB would be afforded the opportunity to make submissions upon circulation of the Draft Report.  The Investigator also provided an update as to the timeline of the Inquiry and outlined the next steps of same. \n \n33.\tBy letter dated 17 April 2020, the Investigator wrote to Meta Ireland to provide the opportunity for Meta Ireland to make submissions as to confidentiality over the material furnished in the course of the Inquiry, in particular, the submissions dated 28 September 2018 and 22 February 2019.  Meta Ireland replied on 24 April 2020. \n \n34.\tThe Draft Report was circulated to the Parties on 20 May 2020.  The Investigator also wrote to NOYB on 20 May 2020 to provide an update on same.  NOYB informed the Commission, by way of letter dated 3 June 2020, that NOYB did not accept the Investigator’s responses in his letter dated 23 March 2020 to be adequate in addressing NOYB’s concerns. \n \n35.\tBoth Parties were granted extensions on the deadline for submissions on the Draft Report.404  Meta Ireland provided the Investigator with its submissions on 22 June 2020.  NOYB made their submissions on 19 August 2020, emphasising, in the covering email, their concerns as to procedural issues and an alleged failure by the Commission to provide “all files of the case and all submissions of Facebook”.  NOYB also alleged that the submissions amounted to a “supplemental complaint”. \n \n36.\tIn the interim, on 25 May 2020, NOYB published an “open letter to all DPAs” (the “Open Letter”) which concerned several of the Commission’s complaint-based inquiries, including this Inquiry.  In this letter, NOYB made a number of serious allegations against the Commission, including allegations of bias and \n“secret cooperation” between the Commission and Meta Ireland and non-compliance with national \n                                               \n404404 In this regard, Meta Ireland were granted an additional two days.  As there was disagreement as to the language requirements of the Inquiry output (discussed further below), NOYB was given an additional two weeks after resolution of the disagreement.  \nprocedural law (e.g. access to documents).  NOYB also expressed concern with the scope of the investigation identified in the Draft Report and with the cooperation mechanism provided for the in GDPR.  The EDPB responded to NOYB on 9 June 2020 in which it affirmed that the EDPB was “committed to find solutions and address the challenges ahead where it lies within our competence”.  In essence, the EDPB noted and accepted the limitations on its competence in this regard. \n \n37.\tAs outlined above, the Final Report was transmitted to the Parties on 18 January 2021.  The Parties were notified of the commencement of decision-making stage on 7 April 2021.  The Preliminary Draft was circulated to the Parties on 23 December 2021.  The Preliminary Draft was also transmitted to the Belgian DPA via the IMI on 23 December 2021. \n \n38.\tOn 29 December 2021, NOYB wrote to the Belgian DPA, copying the Commission, alleging procedural concerns and requesting (i) sight of all submissions in the Inquiry, (ii) the ability to make submissions in French and (iii) an oral hearing.  The Commission replied to NOYB on 17 January 2022, responding to these requests. \n \n39.\tMeta Ireland wrote to the Commission on 4 January 2022 seeking clarification on the confidentiality of the materials, to which the Commission responded on 5 January 2022.  Meta Ireland sought additional clarification on 7 January 2022.  On 27 January 2022, Meta Ireland further contacted the Commission to request that the inquiry process be paused until the resolution of similar matters raised in (i) a preliminary reference to the CJEU in respect of C-446/21 Meta Ireland and/or (ii) the Article 60 process in respect of IN-18-05-05 concerning NOYB and Meta Ireland.  Meta Ireland restated this position in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft dated 4 February 2022 and alleged that CJEU jurisprudence on this matter precludes the Commission from adopting a decision when similar matters are pending. .  Meta Ireland made further submissions on this point by way of letter dated 16 March 2022.  The Commission responded to this request on 1 April 2022. \n \n40.\tThe Commission received submissions from Meta Ireland on 4 February 2022 on the Preliminary Draft.  NOYB also transmitted its submissions on the Preliminary Draft to the Commission on 4 February 2022.  In its accompanying cover letter, NOYB restated its allegations of bias and procedural concerns; in addition, NOYB requested that the submissions it made on the Preliminary Draft in respect of IN-1805-05 concerning NOYB and Meta Ireland also be considered its submissions for the purposes of this Inquiry. \n \n3.\tProcedural Matters arising in the course of the Inquiry \n \n41.\tAs I have set out, this is the Decision proposed to be made by the Commission, (at this point, I note that I am the sole member of the Commission) in accordance with section 113 of the 2018 Act.  Section 113 of the 2018 Act provides as follows:  \n \n(2) Where section 109 (4)(a) applies, the Commission shall— \n \n(a)\tin accordance with subsection (3), make a draft decision in respect of the complaint (or, as the case may be, part of the complaint) and, where applicable, as to the envisaged action to be taken in relation to the controller or processor concerned, and \n \n(b)\tin accordance with Article 60 and, where appropriate, Article 65, adopt its decision in respect of the complaint or, as the case may be, part of the complaint. \n \n(3) In making a draft decision under subsection (2)(a), the Commission shall, where applicable, have regard to— \n     \n(a)\tthe information obtained by the Commission in its examination of the complaint, including, where an inquiry has been conducted in respect of the complaint, the information obtained in the inquiry, and \n    \n(b)\tany draft for a decision that is submitted to the Commission by a supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(4). \n    \n(4) Where the Commission adopts a decision under subsection (2)(b) to the effect that an infringement by the controller or processor concerned has occurred or is occurring, it shall, in addition, make a decision— \n    \n(a) where an inquiry has been conducted in respect of the complaint— \n    \n(i)\tas to whether a corrective power should be exercised in respect of the controller or processor concerned, and \n    \n(ii)\twhere it decides to so exercise a corrective power, the corrective power that is to be exercised, \n \n42.\tIn accordance with section 113, it is for me, as the sole member of the Commission, to: consider the information obtained in the course of the Inquiry; to decide whether an infringement is occurring or has occurred; and if so, to decide on the envisaged action in respect of the controller (if any).  In so doing, I will carry out an independent assessment of all of the materials provided to me by the Investigator.   \n \n43.\tGiven that the Commission is the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) GDPR for the purposes of the data processing operations at issue, I was obliged under section 113(2) and Article 60(3) GDPR to complete the Draft Decision to be provided to the CSAs, as defined in Article 4(22).   \n \n44.\tAs set out above at paragraph 1, this is the Decision, having submitted the Draft Decision under Article 60(3) GDPR to the CSAs, and having taken account of the Article 65 Decision, as explained in the text of the Decision itself.  The purpose of the Draft Schedule and the Preliminary Draft Decision were to allow the parties to make any submissions in respect of my provisional findings set out.  This is the finalised version of the Schedule and Decision, as also explained in further detail in the Decision. \n \n4.\tDecision-Making Process and the Materials Considered \n \n45.\tThe Final Report was transmitted to me on 18 January 2021, together with the Investigator’s file, containing copies of all correspondence exchanged between the Investigator and the Parties; and copies of any submissions made by the Parties, including the submissions made by the Parties in respect of the Investigator’s Draft Report.  A letter then issued to the Parties on 7 April 2021 to confirm the commencement of the decision-making process.   \n \n46.\tAs set out above, a Preliminary Draft was circulated to the Parties for their submissions on 23 December 2021.  The Parties provided the Commission with any such submissions on 4 February 2022.  For the avoidance of doubt, I have had regard to all material contained in the file when preparing this Draft Decision. \n \n47.\tA number of preliminary matters must be considered to ascertain whether the Commission is competent in respect of this Complaint.  In this regard, I must be satisfied that Meta Ireland is the relevant controller for processing in the context of the Instagram service.  If so, I must also be satisfied that the main or single establishment of Meta Ireland is in Ireland (i.e. that the Dublin office of Meta Ireland is the main or single establishment of Meta Ireland) and that the processing in connection with the Instagram service is cross-border in nature.  In addition, I must also be satisfied that NOYB’s mandate is valid in accordance with the requirements of Article 80 GDPR.  \n \na. Meta Ireland as Data Controller \n \n48.\tPursuant to Article 4(7) GDPR, the term “data controller”: \n \n“means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law”. \n \n49.\tThe concept of the “controller” is broadly defined  and encompasses a “functional” or “factual” test.407  In essence, I must be satisfied that, in the context of the specific processing at issue, Meta Ireland is “the entity that actually exerts a decisive influence on the purposes and means of the processing”.   In this regard, I also note that the EDPB is of the view that “special attention” must be given to the controllership assessment when an individual establishment may be processing personal data within a company group.    \n \n50.\tFirst, I note that the Complaint was made against “Facebook Ireland Ltd.” (now known as “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited”), located at “4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland”, as the “operator” of the Instagram application.   NOYB thereby identified Facebook (now Meta Ireland) as the relevant controller for the purposes of this Complaint; this was noted by Meta Ireland in their submissions dated 28 September 2018.    \n \n51.\tIn his assessment of the matter, the Investigator was of the view that Meta Ireland was the appropriate controller in respect of the processing at issue.   In this regard, I note that NOYB, in its submissions dated 19 August 2020 on the Draft Report, reserved its position in respect of controllership and asserted that “the fact that the complaint is filed against Facebook Ireland does not mean that the Complainant ‘recognises the entity as the relevant data controller’”.  \n \n52.\tIn considering the issue of whether Meta Ireland is the controller for the specific processing at issue in this Complaint, i.e. processing in the context of the Instagram application, I have first considered whether Meta Ireland is an appropriate entity as outlined in Article 4(7) GDPR.  I subsequently considered whether Meta Ireland could be said to determine the “purposes and means” of processing the context of the Instagram service. \n \n53.\tI note that “Facebook Ireland Limited” with the address “4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland” was registered with the Companies Registration Office (the “CRO”) as a private company limited by shares on 6 October 2008.414  I further note that, on 5 January 2022, a change of name from “Facebook Ireland Limited” to “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited” was registered with the CRO on 5 January 2022 and effective from 22 December 2021.   Accordingly, I am satisfied that Meta Ireland is a legal person as a matter of Irish law.  I also am satisfied on the information available that the Instagram service is provided via Meta Ireland in the EU/EEA and that Instagram does not exist as an independent entity with separate legal personality from Meta Ireland. \n \n54.\tWith respect to whether Meta Ireland determines the “purposes and means” of processing in the context of the Instagram service, I have had regard to several factors.  First, I note that Meta Ireland informed the Commission on 25 May 2018 that “Facebook Ireland Limited” is the data controller for the Instagram service in the EU.   Meta Ireland reaffirmed this position in their submissions dated 28 September 2018.    \n \n55.\tInstagram’s Data Policy applicable at the date of the date of the Complaint (i.e. the Data Policy last revised 19 April 2018) states that: \n \n“The data controller responsible for your information is Facebook Ireland, which you can contact online, or by mail at: \n \nFacebook Ireland Ltd. \n4 Grand Canal Square \nGrand Canal Harbour \nDublin 2 Ireland”.  \n \n56.\tIn addition, the Instagram Terms of Use at the date of the Complaint states that “Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited”.  \n \n57.\tAs regards the decision-making capacity of Meta Ireland in the context of the Instagram service, I note that in the submissions dated 28 September 2018, Meta Ireland further stated that: \n \n“Facebook Ireland is the service provider of the Instagram service in the EU and also determines the purposes and means of processing EU users’ data. It is the only entity with decision-making power regarding: \n \n•\tSetting polices governing how EU user data is processed; \n•\tDeciding whether and how our products that involve processing of user data will be offered in the EU; \n•\tControlling the access to and use of EU user data; and \n•\tHandling and resolving data-related inquiries and complaints from EU users of the \nInstagram service whether directly or indirectly via regulators”.  \n \n58.\tOn the basis of the above, I am satisfied that Meta Ireland is a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) GDPR for processing in the context of the Instagram service. \n \nb. Competence of the Commission to Act as the Lead Supervisory Authority \n \n59.\tIn accordance with Article 56(1) GDPR, a supervisory authority is competent to act as the LSA where the (1) main or single establishment of the controller is located in the same jurisdiction as that authority and (2) the processing carried out by the controller is cross-border in nature.  In assessing whether the Commission has competence to act as the LSA, I have considered both issues. \nMain or Single Establishment of Meta Ireland  \n60.\tIn determining whether the main or single establishment of Meta Ireland is located in Ireland, I considered two related issues: first, I considered whether Meta Ireland was a controller in respect of the processing at issue and, second, if so, whether Meta Ireland has its main or single establishment in Ireland.  In respect of the first consideration, as outlined above in paragraphs 47 – 57.  I am satisfied that Meta Ireland is a controller for the processing of personal data in the context of the Instagram service. \n \n61.\tAs regards the concepts of main or single establishment, I note that the term “establishment” is not defined in the substantive provisions of the GDPR.  Nonetheless, Recital 22, which acts an interpretative aid, states that: \n \n“Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect”. \n \n62.\tIn respect of “main establishment”, I note that Article 4(16) GDPR defines a controller’s main establishment as its place of “central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union…”. \n \n63.\tThis is further supported by Recital 36 to the GDPR which provides that  \n \n“The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment.” \n \n64.\tIn this regard, I note that the Investigator was satisfied that “the Dublin office of Facebook Ireland \nLimited is (at least) a single establishment of the controller in Ireland for the purposes of the GDPR”.  \n \n65.\tIn submissions dated 28 September 2018, Meta Ireland restated its position that it considers the Dublin office of Meta Ireland to be the main establishment in respect of processing in the context of the Instagram service.   In this regard, Meta Ireland stated that: \n \n“Facebook Ireland’s Dublin office satisfies both strands of the ‘main establishment’ test set out in Article 4(16) of the GDPR as it is Facebook Ireland’s place of ‘central administration’ in the Union and the establishment where ‘decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken’ in relation to the Instagram service. Facebook Ireland’s governance, structures, processes, experience and significant resources means that it clearly ‘has the power to have such decisions implemented’”.  \n \n66.\tI also note that Meta Ireland provided extensive detail as to its personnel numbers in the Dublin office of Meta Ireland and information on the internal structure of Meta Ireland in respect of delivering the Instagram service.   In this regard, Meta Ireland stated: \n \n“Facebook Ireland has more than  personnel in its headquarters in Dublin who manage, among other things, the operations and data processing relating to EU users of Instagram, including the analysis and fulfilment of those users’ rights, information security including user information security, engineering, user support, law enforcement response, data protection and privacy operations and policy and legal teams including, critically, the data protection teams. Facebook Ireland’s senior decision makers operate in cross-functional teams, which include representatives from its Legal, Policy, Law Enforcement Response, Community Operations, Information Security, and Privacy Operations. Many of these teams have designated contact points for issues related to Instagram EU user data, and some have dedicated personnel now specifically responsible for those functions supporting the Instagram service in the EU. For example, the Facebook Ireland data protection legal team and security team both now deal with all relevant issues relating to Instagram user data in the EU. Each of those teams also now have designated contact points for Instagram, who are responsible to ensure that all of the functions provided by those broader teams are leveraged for oversight and management of Instagram EU data. The DPO and his office provide oversight of these teams and their work. On a daily basis, Facebook Ireland’s personnel are responsible for managing the personal data of EU users of the Instagram service and determining the means and purposes of processing this personal data, including collaborating to formulate Instagram user data processing policies and overseeing the implementation of these policies in respect of users of the Instagram service in the EU”.   \n \n67.\tOn the basis of the above, I am satisfied that the Dublin office of Meta Ireland makes decisions as to the purposes and means of processing in the context of the Instagram service.  I further note that nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that the position, in this regard, has changed since I considered it in the context of the preparation of the Preliminary Draft Decision. \n \n68.\tAccordingly, I am satisfied that the Dublin office of Meta Ireland is the main establishment of Meta Ireland for the purposes of the GDPR.  It is my view that Meta Ireland has its main establishment in Ireland in respect of the processing at issue in this Complaint. \nCross-Border Processing \n69.\tI note that the Complaint has been transferred from the Belgian DPA to the Commission on the understanding that the processing at issue is cross-border in nature.  Nonetheless, I consider it necessary, for completeness, to consider the matter. \n \n70.\tArticle 4(23) GDPR defines “cross-border processing” as follows: \n \n“(a) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State;  or \n(b) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State.” \n \n71.\tIn submissions dated 28 September 2018, Meta Ireland stated that it “provides the Instagram service to hundreds of millions of users across the European region and in doing so is engaged in cross-border processing pursuant to Article 4(23) GDPR” and thus processing in this context is cross-border in nature.   Moreover, in both the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy applicable at the date of the Complaint, Meta Ireland stated that the Instagram service is a “Global service”  which is provided “around the world”.   For completeness, I note that the Investigator was of the view that processing in the context of the Instagram service was cross-border in nature. \n \n72.\tOn the basis of the above, I am satisfied that the processing of personal data within the context of the Instagram service is cross-border in nature within the meaning of Article 4(23) GDPR. \n \nConclusion of the Competence of the Commission to Act as LSA \n \n73.\tAs it appears to me that Meta Ireland has its main establishment in Ireland and that the processing of personal data in the context of the Instagram service is cross-border in nature, I am satisfied that the Commission has competence, in accordance with the requirements of Article 56(1) GDPR, to act as the LSA for the purposes of this Complaint.  I further note that nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that the position, in this regard, has changed since I considered it in the context of the preparation of the Preliminary Draft Decision. \n \nc. Issues in respect of Belgian Law \n \n74.\tAnother procedural issue arose which has underpinned NOYB’s submissions in respect of this Inquiry.  In essence, this concerns the issue of which law ought to be applicable in respect of the Complaint.  As outlined above, the Complaint was lodged with the Belgian DPA who subsequently transferred it to the Commission on the basis that the Commission was the competent authority (i.e. the LSA) in respect of this Complaint.   \n \n75.\tIn submissions dated 19 August 2020, NOYB alleged that, as the Complaint had been lodged in Belgium and in accordance with the requirements of Belgian law, “Belgian law remains applicable to the procedure” and the Belgian DPA is the competent authority in respect of this Complaint.429  In support of this argument, NOYB submitted that the provisions of the relevant Belgian legislation  are silent as to whether there is a change in procedure in circumstances wherein a Complaint is transferred from the Belgian DPA to another authority.431  NOYB further alleged that “[t]he GDPR does not provide for the cooperation mechanism to deprive complainants from the procedure applicable in their jurisdiction” and that it would make “little sense” for certain procedural rules  to change after the Complaint has been lodged.433  In essence, NOYB was of the view that, in making a decision in respect of a Complaint which originated in another Member State, I am bound to apply the national administrative and procedural law of that jurisdiction, Belgian law in this particular case.    \n \n76.\tNOYB restated this issue in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft, taking the view that, as the Complainant was bound by certain procedural laws (i.e. Belgian law in this case), the Complaint therefore had to be interpreted by the Commission in accordance with that law.   It is NOYB’s position that the Commission should have cooperated with the supervisory authority in which the Complaint was lodged (i.e. the Belgian DPA) to “properly interpret the Complaint”.    I further note NOYB’s assertion that the Commission “seems to follow an archaic and purely nationalistic idea of international law” and that is incorrect to find that the Commission “must not interpret complaints, contracts or other legally relevant matters under the applicable law of another Member State”.  \n \n77.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, I emphasise that the Commission has cooperated in full with the Belgian DPA throughout this Inquiry. \n \n78.\tIn relation to the possible application of Belgian law, I note that NOYB has not identified any legal authority – either in Irish law or EU law – to support this position.  Moreover, I have stated above that I am satisfied that the Commission is the LSA for the purposes of the GDPR.  I note that each Member State is required by Article 51(1) GDPR to “provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation”.  For completeness, I emphasise that the Belgian DPA has also stated that it considers the Commission to be the LSA for the purposes of this \nInquiry.   I also note Recital 117 GDPR, an interpretive aid to the operative provision, which states that “Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure” [my emphasis]. \n \n79.\tThe 2018 Act governs the establishment of the Commission as a supervisory authority for the purposes of the GDPR.439  The Commission’s functions are outlined in section 12 of the 2018 Act; section 12 does not provide that the Commission is competent as regards national administrative or procedural law other than that in Ireland. \n \n80.\tThe powers of the Commission must be limited to those conferred on it by law.  The Commission is tasked with encouraging, monitoring and enforcing compliance with the GDPR.  In that context it is, like all other public authorities in the State, bound by the administrative law of Ireland and EU law, including EU law on fair procedures and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.  Further, as I stated above, Article 56(1) GDPR sets out that “the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority”.  \n \n81.\tThe Commission therefore derives its legal authority to handle the Complaint from the GDPR and the 2018 Act, and is, in that regard, bound by the legal orders set out above.  The Commission is not bound, nor must it have regard to, the procedural and/or administrative law of Belgium, or of any other jurisdiction, even in circumstances where a Complaint was initially lodged in that jurisdiction.  Moreover, it seems to me that not only does the national procedural and/or administrative law of Belgium not bind the Commission, but that any attempt by the Commission to apply such law would be plainly ultra vires the powers conferred on the Commission by law. \n \nd. Consumer Protection and Competition Authorities \n \n82.\tThe Investigator informed NOYB by letter dated 16 January 2019 that the Commission does not have competence to investigate matters pertaining to competition or consumer law.   Therefore, the Investigator provided the relevant competition  and consumer  law authorities with a partially redacted copy of the Complaint (published on the noyb.eu website) for consideration of matters which may fall within their competence.  \n \n83.\tIn submissions on the Draft Report, NOYB expressed “astonishment” that the Commission had referred matters relating to competition and consumer law to the relevant regulatory authorities.   NOYB sought sight of any and all communication in this respect and submitted that the referral to other regulatory authorities was not appropriate as the Commission had competence to consider the entirety of the Complaint.  \n \n84.\tIn this regard, I emphasise that the Commission’s competence is limited to matters pertaining to data protection.  Accordingly, the Commission cannot consider issues which relate to competition or consumer law.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the Investigator was correct in referring the appropriate matters to the relevant authorities. \n \ne. The Right to be Heard and Access to the Complete File \n \n85.\tIn the course of the Inquiry, NOYB also submitted that “both parties have to receive all files, documents and submissions before a DPA to be able to defend their legal positions”.   In this regard, it should also be noted that NOYB has expressed concern that not “all documents were communicated to noyb”.   In particular, NOYB requested that “all communication with Facebook concerning this case (no matter if in writing or orally) were recorded and disclosed to us”.   This matter is linked to NOYB’s submission that the Commission is bound to apply Belgian administrative and procedural law (which I have considered above) as NOYB relies on Belgian law  to support the argument that NOYB, as a party to the procedure, is entitled to access to the entire file in respect of the Complaint and Inquiry.  \n \n86.\tIn response to NOYB’s request for access to the complete file, the Investigator correctly informed NOYB by way of letter dated 16 January 2019 that “there is no statutory right of access to the complete inquiry file under Irish law” and that the parties to the Complaint would be provided with the material information and documents as appropriate to ensure the right to be heard.   In the Preliminary Draft, I noted my agreement with the Investigator in this matter.   \n \n87.\tIn response to the Preliminary Draft, NOYB wrote to the Belgian DPA on 29 December 2021, alleging that the Commission “is (again) withholding crucial documents from the complainant and thereby violates [the] right to good administration including the right to be heard, and the right to access documents”.   Further, in submissions on the Preliminary Draft dated 4 February 2022, NOYB reiterated these claims and requested “full access to all submissions, exchanges and documentation”.   There is no factual basis for this allegation; as the Commission stated by way of letter dated 17 January 2022, NOYB has been provided with the submissions made by Meta Ireland on all of the substantive issues in this Inquiry.   To this I would add that NOYB has not identified, with any degree of specificity, which provision of Irish law – or indeed EU law – it relies on to support its position that it is entitled to full access to the file.  Rather, as I have noted above, this argument appears to be predicated on Belgian law being applicable in the within proceedings.   \n \n88.\tFor reasons I have outlined above, it cannot be the case that the Commission is bound to apply Belgian law.  As there seems to me to be no authority to the contrary, I am satisfied that the Commission furnished NOYB with sufficient information and material to ensure that they could effectively discharge their right to be heard.   It is on this basis that I agree with the Investigator on this issue and do not propose to consider it further. \n  \nf. Language of the Procedure \n \n89.\tNOYB also expressed concern with the language (i.e. English) in which the Inquiry material was issued to it,  despite the fact that the Complaint lodged with the Belgian DPA contained English, French and German versions.  In essence, NOYB’s position was that, as the Complaint had been lodged with the Belgian DPA in the French language, any Inquiry output should be in French.  As the supervisory authority in which the Complaint was lodged, the issue of translation of the Inquiry output is a matter for the Belgian DPA.  The Belgian DPA informed NOYB on 8 July 2020 that a French translation of the Draft Report would not be provided. \n \n90.\tNOYB also expressed concern about language in the course of the Inquiry.  In this regard, NOYB stated that: \n“noyb was required to file the present submissions in English, although the complaint was filed in French - with an unofficial translation in German and English by noyb for the convenience of the DPAs involved - despite noyb’s request to the DPAs to receive a translation of the inquiry report in French before making its submission. This request was denied by both the DPC and the APD on the basis that some exchanges had already taken place in English with noyb.”.  \n91.\tNOYB further noted that the English version of the Complaint should be considered an “informal” translation as it was a “machine translation”.   NOYB expressed particular concern that the Belgian DPA chose to conduct the procedure in English and did not translate the inquiry reports into the language of the Named Data Subject.   For completeness, I note that I issued the Preliminary Draft to both NOYB and the Belgian DPA in English.  NOYB made additional submissions on this point. \n \n92.\tIndeed, by way of letter to the Belgian DPA on 29 December 2021, NOYB expressed concern that the Preliminary Draft and Schedule were provided in English as “this would cause procedural problems in the case of an appeal before the Belgian courts”.   In this respect, I note that NOYB did not identify with specificity any such “procedural problems”.  NOYB also indicated in its submissions on the Preliminary Draft that this may mean that “this document may not be seen as properly served under the relevant national legislation”.    \n \n93.\tThe Commission responded to these allegations on 17 January 2022, reiterating the position that, as English is the language of the Commission, as LSA, it is also the language of this Inquiry.   Moreover, while the supervisory authority in which the Complaint was first filed may choose to translate any such documents, the Belgian DPA has decided not to do so in this Inquiry.   To this, I would add that the submissions in respect of the service of documents purport to concern Belgian law which, as I have outlined above, the Commission is not competent to apply and interpret. \n \n94.\tIn addition, in respect of the claim that the Commission is required to translate any documents it prepares in the course of an inquiry or decision-making process, I emphasise that, as a public body, the Commission may only be required to provide official publications in English and/or Irish.  Therefore, it was appropriate that the Commission prepared and transmitted the inquiry reports and the Preliminary Draft - and indeed this Draft Decision – in English. \n \ng.  Allegations of Bias \n \n95.\tIn the letter dated 3 December 2018, NOYB raised a number of procedural concerns with the Commission.  In particular, NOYB made an allegation of bias against the Commission.   In this regard, NOYB cited the rule against bias in Irish law and Belgian law  and alleged that the rule had been infringed in this case as Meta Ireland developed the Terms of Use and Data Policy in the course of engagement with the Commission’s consultation functions.   NOYB did not identify, with specificity, the legal authority for these rules as a matter of Irish or Belgian law.  I further note that NOYB did not outline the applicable legal test(s) for bias or explain how these tests have been satisfied in this context.   \n \n96.\tInstead, NOYB alleged that by engaging with Meta Ireland in the course of the consultation functions, the Commission had given “approval” to Meta Ireland as to the lawfulness of the Terms of Use and Data Policy.   To support this claim, NOYB referred to proceedings before the Vienna Regional Court for Civil Matters in Austria, to which the Commission was not party to.   In this regard, NOYB stated that the consultation process  \n \n“does not just raise questions about your claim that you have to “investigate” and “inquire” this matter – when in fact you have already negotiated with the Facebook Group about these legal and factual questions between 2017 and 2018, but raises issues about an obvious bias of a decision maker that has previously approved the criticized mechanism”.  \n \n97.\tNOYB did not substantiate this serious allegation of bias with factual evidence that the Commission approved the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy.  Rather, as I have already stated, this allegation of bias is unfounded as there is a functional separation between the Commission’s consultation, investigative and decision-making functions.  It is made clear to all participants who engage in a consultation exercise(s) with the Commission that such engagement is not an endorsement of GDPR compliance.   The Investigator informed Meta Ireland of this distinction.  \n \n98.\tIn response to the initial allegations of bias, the Investigator correctly informed NOYB that “[a]t no time in the course of its engagement with Facebook - or any other organisation which sought to consult with the DPC in relation to its GDPR preparations - did the DPC approve, jointly develop, endorse, consent to, or negotiate on the processing operations of Facebook”.   The Investigator further stated that the consultation process only provides “high level feedback” to controllers and formed part of the Commission’s statutory obligations in promoting awareness of GDPR obligations.   I am satisfied that the Investigator was correct in his assessment of this matter. \n \n99.\tNOYB made further allegations of bias by the Commission in the Open Letter dated 25 May 2020, alleging that there was “secret cooperation” between the Commission and Meta Ireland and that “the DPC has maneuvered [sic] itself into a situation where it is structurally biased because it is essentially reviewing its own legal advice to Facebook on how to bypass Article 6(1)(a) GDPR”.  \n \n100.\tNOYB restated its allegations of bias in the submissions on the Draft Report dated 19 August 2020.  Indeed, NOYB stated that: \n \n“Since Facebook’s submission explicitly mentions that the Irish DPC discussed the issues at the core of the complaint with Facebook in ten sessions (e.g. page 2 of the Facebook submission of 28 September 2018), the problem of bias and lack of independence of the DPA is once again raised. \n \nIt is impossible to imagine that a DPA would make use of its corrective powers against a controller whose behaviour was already discussed and approved by the same authority. We have strong reservations about the independence of a DPA adopting such practices, which is at odds with Article 52 GDPR and 43 LAPD). \n \nWe do not yet know how the DPC or the APD intend to address this problem and we expressly reserve the right to appeal any decision that would be adopted by the DPC, given that they have met with Facebook and discussed the matter in a secret meeting”.  \n \t \n101.\tFollowing the provision of a copy of the relevant parts of the Preliminary Draft to NOYB on 23 December 2021, NOYB reiterated these allegations of bias.  In particular, NOYB referred to “disclosures” made on its website, noyb.eu, on 4 December 2021 to support its assertion that the “DPC is biased in relation to the case as it (A) met with Facebook more [sic] at least 10 times between November 2017 and the coming into force of the GDPR, (B) the DPC then tried to push the consent bypass into EDPB Guidelines and (C) the DPC then tried to delay the publication of the deadline, once the EDPB rejected the joint approach of Facebook and the DPC”[footnotes omitted].   NOYB also alleged that the position I took in the Preliminary Draft “ignores” both (i) its submissions and (ii) the relevant and reasoned objections made by CSAs in IN-18-05-05 concerning NOYB and Meta Ireland.  \n \n102.\tI will address the latter first.  While I accept that, in the Draft Decision, I had taken a similar approach in IN-18-05-05, this was necessitated by the fact that NOYB submitted a virtually identical complaint in both inquiries and, when considering similar issues, I must ensure consistency and coherence with prior decisions.  I would further add that, given that both complaints concern the same group of companies (i.e. Meta Platforms), a degree of similarity is inevitable.  Notwithstanding this, I strongly refute the allegation that I have “ignored” the positions of either NOYB or the CSAs, as expressed in IN-18-05-05.  Indeed, in preparing the Draft Decision, I carefully considered these submissions. \n \n103.\tIn respect of the serious allegation of bias, NOYB also restated its position that the Commission “has also never provided any evidence, memo or other evidence to substantiate its claims that these meetings did not have the substance that Facebook alleged before the Austrian courts” to support its assertions of bias.   NOYB further stated that the Commission should have demanded a correction from Meta Ireland and implied that the Commission’s failure to do so further supported its allegations of bias.478  It simply cannot be the case that the Commission’s decision to not “demand a correction” is indicative of bias by the Commission.   \n \n104.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that the Commission’s consultation function is distinct from both its inquiry and decision-making functions.  I further emphasise that the consultation functions are not an endorsement or approval of a controller or processor’s compliance with the GDPR.  It is factually not the case that the Commission endorsed or approved the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy that were in place at the time of the Complaint, or indeed of any other organisation.  Moreover, irrespective of any feedback that may or may not have been provided to Meta Ireland, or any other organisation, the Commission always emphasises that the consultation function is entirely distinct from any statutory inquiries, investigations, or decisions of the Commission.  I also emphasise that this decision-making process is also functionally independent of the procedure conducted by the Investigator that led to the Final Report, just as the statutory inquiries are functionally independent from any and all consultations with the Commission.  The factual premise of the allegation is incorrect and the test for bias has not been met.  \n \n105.\tI am therefore satisfied that fair procedures have been followed in this and every regard thus far throughout the Inquiry. \n \n5.\tScope of the Complaint \n \na. Procedural Issues Arising in respect of the Scope of the Complaint \n \n106.\tAs outlined above, the Inquiry is complaint-based and its scope was defined as an examination as to “whether or not Facebook as data controller for Instagram has discharged its obligations in connection with the subject matter of the Complaint and determine whether or not any provision(s) of the Act and/or the GDPR has been contravened by Facebook as data controller for Instagram in this context”.   In this regard, I note that the scope of the Inquiry was defined by reference to the Complaint.  Accordingly, the scope or parameters of the Complaint determined the scope of the resulting Inquiry. \n \n107.\tIn the course of the Inquiry, a disagreement as to the scope of the Complaint arose between NOYB and the Investigator, such that NOYB alleged that the right to fair procedures had not been respected.  In a letter dated 3 December 2018, NOYB stated that the Complaint was “obviously not limited to the issues you [i.e. the Investigator] identified”.   While NOYB accepted that the Commission could prioritise certain aspects of the Complaint, NOYB asserted that “[i]t cannot be the case that a complaint has “one shot”, while the controller can freely maneuver [sic] in the response and does not have to expect any further question or counterargument by the complainant”.  \n \n108.\tBy letter dated 28 March 2018, the Investigator provided further information to NOYB as regards the scope of the Complaint, noting his view that it “primarily relates to the lawful basis for processing personal data in connection with the Instagram service”.   In this regard, the Investigator considered the Complaint to concern two issues: first, whether the processing of personal data in connection with the Instagram Terms of Service and/or Data Policy was consent for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9(2)(a); and second, whether such consent was lawful.    \n \n109.\tIn response, NOYB stated that it “reserve[d] the right to amend our arguments should one of the controllers seek to depart from the factual or legal premises our complaints were based on”.   In respect of the substantive issues identified by the Investigator, NOYB submitted that the “core issue is clearly that the much stricter provisions on valid ‘consent’ under GDPR cannot be bypassed by simply moving the consent element into terms and conditions”.   I note, for completeness, that NOYB raised additional allegations concerning the scope of the Inquiry in the Open Letter on 25 May 2020.   \n \n110.\tIn the Draft Report, the Investigator relied on a statement in the Complaint which read: \n \n“For practical reasons, the scope of this complaint is explicitly limited to any processing operations that are wholly or partly based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. Our current understanding is, that these are used as bases for all processing operations described in the controller’s privacy policy…”   \n \n111.\tHaving outlined the scope, NOYB added that “[n]evertheless, nothing in this complaint shall indicate that other legal bases the controller may rely on are not equally invalid or may not be equally the subject of subsequent legal actions.”   This qualifying remark, while alluding to the fact that NOYB may have other views in relation to other legal bases for data processing carried out by Meta Ireland (within the context of the Instagram service), is evidently not one that describes the character of the Complaint in question.  While such a remark clearly refers to hypothetical positions NOYB may have or take in the future, it cannot alter the limiting character of the preceding statement in and of itself.  It instead clarifies that NOYB reserved its position in respect of any other legal bases on which Meta Ireland may or may not rely. \n \n112.\tThe Investigator, carefully considering the Complaint and taking an objective reading,  identified the following four issues as falling within the scope of the Complaint: \n \n•\tIssue (a): whether the acceptance of the Terms of Use and/or Data Policy was an act of consent; \n•\tIssue (b): whether Meta Ireland could lawfully rely on necessity for the performance of a contract to process data arising out of the data subject’s acceptance of those same documents;  \n•\tIssue (c): Whether Meta Ireland misled and/or misrepresented the legal basis for processing this data; and  \n•\tIssue (d): Whether Meta Ireland failed to provide the necessary information regarding its legal basis for processing this data. \n \n113.\tIn submissions dated 19 August 2020 on the Draft Inquiry, NOYB asserted that (i) a Complainant could “adapt” the Complaint as there “is no prohibition on filing new submissions” and (ii), in the alternative, the contents of those submissions amounted to an “additional supplemental complaint” as provided for in Article 47 GDPR.  \n \n114.\tIn response to NOYB’s allegations, Meta Ireland submitted that: \n \n“The Complainant has stated [in the Complaint] ‘the scope of this complaint is explicitly limited to any processing operations that are wholly or partly based on Article 6(1)(a) and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR’. As a result, processing pursuant to section 1 of the Terms of Service [sic] falls outside of the Complaint and this Inquiry, given it is not based on Article 6(1)(a) or 9(2)(a)”.  \n \n115.\tWhile the Investigator carefully considered these submissions, he did not revise his view as to the scope of the Complaint.   I should also note, in this regard, that Meta Ireland contended that the scope of the Complaint should be limited to a consideration of processing which is objectively based on consent.    The Investigator found that it was not necessary to engage in a factual “wide-ranging trawl” of each one of Meta Ireland’s processing operations, but instead to carry out a legal and factual analysis based on the objective content of the Complaint itself.   This was based simply on an assessment of the content of the Complaint. \n \n116.\tWhile I acknowledge that NOYB made additional submissions on the substantive position I expressed in the Preliminary Draft,   it is appropriate, I think, to assess at this juncture whether NOYB’s specific allegations of procedural unfairness in how this was addressed by the Commission thus far have merit.  In the Open Letter, NOYB alleged (albeit in the context of a related inquiry) that “the Investigator departed from the applications that were made in accordance with [Belgian] procedural law and decided to investigate only certain elements of our complaint and to reinterpret our requests.”495  Taking \na broad reading of NOYB’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft,  NOYB restated this concern in those submissions. \n \n117.\tI do not agree that this is an accurate or fair representation of what has taken place.  As I (and indeed the Investigator) have set out, Belgian – or any other national law other than Irish law – procedural law does not apply in respect of the activities and/or functions of the Commission.  I therefore, do not accept that there is, in principle, a procedural defect in limiting the scope of a complaint-based inquiry to the objective contents of the very Complaint that led the Commission to conduct an Inquiry.  As well as conforming to section 113 of the 2018 Act (set out earlier in this Schedule), this approach is perfectly logical.  \n \n118.\tNOYB’s arguments in relation to any alleged procedural defects in the manner in which the scope of the Complaint is to be determined, i.e. by the objective content of the Complaint, are based on Belgian law, and on the LAPD, in particular.  Insofar as that those arguments are based on Belgian law, for reasons already set out and taking into account the competence of the Commission, the Commission cannot consider those arguments, save to the extent that they raise issues of either Irish or EU law. \n \n119.\tMoreover, the decision to conduct a complaint-based Inquiry arising out of the contents of a Complaint seems to me to be a perfectly logical approach.  The alternative would be an open-ended procedure, where the content of a “complaint” would crystallise at some unspecified future date.  The inherent problem with such an approach is that it would not amount to an inquiry based on the Complaint which was lodged with the Commission, but would instead be an inquiry directed by NOYB, with its subject matter and steps dictated on an evolving and ongoing basis by NOYB.  Furthermore, it is unclear how it could be said that such an approach constitutes a complaint that concerns personal data relating to a complainant.  This would presumably only occur once a complainant is satisfied of receipt of all information they might require, and has been afforded the opportunity to amend the complaint itself based on the submissions of the other party.  \n \n120.\tThe unfairness that could arise from such an approach stems from the fact that it would, in effect, enable a form of post-hoc amendment to an existing complaint over the course of an indefinite period of time, which could only come to an end at a time and in a manner of the complainant’s choosing.  This would not only amount to a fundamentally one-sided approach, but would also alter the character of an inquiry to the extent that it could no longer be described as “complaint-based”, but rather “complainant-led”.  Such a request following a Complaint that the Commission would consider a series of extremely broad requests to fundamentally alter an inquiry and deviate from the initial Complaint it had begun to investigate is therefore procedurally problematic.  NOYB has pointed to no legal provision that mandates this, aside from assertions made in relation to Belgian law that have already been addressed herein. \n \n121.\tI would add that this also applies to aspects of the Complaint that either reserve NOYB’s position or express views on hypothetical investigative and/or corrective powers that, in NOYB’s personal view, the Commission should exercise.  I see no breach of fair procedures in considering the Complaint as a whole in order to determine the exact infringements being alleged.  At this juncture, I note that NOYB may not compel the Commission, or indeed any other supervisory authority, to carry out certain actions or impose particular corrective powers.  Indeed, in this regard, I note that Article 52 GDPR stipulates that each supervisory authority must act with “complete independence” in discharging its functions under the GDPR.  Therefore, while I take account of the parties’ submissions, I am not compelled to act or impose certain corrective powers by virtue of any such submissions. \n \n122.\tNOYB, having lodged the Complaint with the Belgian DPA, responded to the Draft Report, which set out clearly the submissions of Meta Ireland and the Investigator’s views on same.  NOYB were also afforded the opportunity to make submissions on the Preliminary Draft.  No suggestion has been made that the alternative procedure proposed by NOYB is a requirement of Irish law, nor that the procedure that has been followed in relation to the scope breaches any rules of fair procedures in Irish law.  Moreover, I am unaware of any case law or statutory provisions in Irish law or EU law that suggests that such an approach is contrary to NOYB’s right to fair procedures, and NOYB has not referred to any such law in its submissions. \n \nb. Substantive Scope of the Complaint \n \n123.\tAt a general level, this complaint-based Inquiry concerns the requirement under EU data protection law for any entity collecting and processing personal data to establish “a lawful basis” for the processing under Articles 6 GDPR.  This particular Complaint was lodged by reference to the Instagram service (for which Meta Ireland is the controller) and its lawful basis for processing user personal data and “special category” personal data.  I have set out, in summary form, the contents of the Complaint and arguments contained in it at Section 2 of the Draft Decision.  \n \nLegislative Provisions \n124.\t“Personal data” is defined under Article 4(1) GDPR as: \n \n“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”. \n \n125.\tMoreover, Article 4(13) GDPR defines the “genetic data” referred to above as: \n \n“personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question”. \n \n126.\tArticle 4(14) GDPR defines “biometric data” as: \n \n “personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data”. \n \n127.\tFinally, “data concerning health” is defined by Article 4(15) GDPR as: \n \n“personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status”. \n \n128.\tThe other special categories or personal data referred to in Article 9 GDPR are not defined in the GDPR. \n \n129.\tAs set out above, Article 6 GDPR sets out the lawful bases for the processing of personal data. The provisions of Article 6 that arise in this complaint-based Inquiry are the first two lawful basis listed in the Article, in Articles 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) GDPR.  Article 6(1) GDPR states: \n“6. 1 Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n(a)\tthe data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; \n(b)\tprocessing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; \n(c)\tprocessing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; \n(d)\tprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; \n(e)\tprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; \n(f)\tprocessing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. \nPoint (f)f the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.” \n \n130.\tA number of conditions for consent are enumerated in Article 7 GDPR: \n \n“1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. \n \n2.\tIf the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. \n3.\tThe data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. \n4.\tWhen assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.” \n \n131.\tArticle 13(c) GDPR requires data controllers to provide information to data subjects on “the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing”. \n \n132.\tArticle 12(1) GDPR requires that “[t]he controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14…to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language…”. \n \nMy Consideration of the Scope of the Complaint \n \n133.\tThe starting point of the Complaint is that in accepting the Instagram Terms of Use (and, allegedly, its Data Policy), all data processing is purported to have been brought under the lawful basis of consent for the purposes of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. This starting point was rejected in Meta Ireland’s submissions.  The Investigator also rejected this and, for the reasons set out below, I too rejected it in the Draft Decision.  This rejection of the foundational premise of the Complaint has inevitably rendered the overall subject-matter of the Complaint effectively less cohesive.   \n \n134.\tThe Complaint also refers to processing of special category data covered by Article 9 GDPR.  NOYB’s submissions on the Draft Report make further arguments in this regard, focussing on (i) the alleged ability of Instagram to target users on the basis on special category data and (ii) the purported fact that “messages, pictures, and all interaction data, event invitations or postings from other users regularly contain special categories of data (e.g. messages on health or sex life and invitations to political events)”.   I expressed the view that, in the Draft Decision, NOYB did not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate these claims. \n \n135.\tMy view, as expressed in the Draft Decision was that, for the reasons set out above and the additional reasons set out below where I expressed my views, in the Draft Decision, on the scope of the Complaint, the Complaint even taken at its height quite clearly only concerned data processing arising out of the act of acceptance.  In the Draft Decision, I expressed the view that NOYB’s central arguments on “forced consent” were predicated on the assertion by NOYB that the acceptance was forcing consent to personal data processing for the purposes of the GDPR.  \n \n136.\tOn this basis, I did not accept, in the Draft Decision, that the processing of sensitive categories of personal data on the basis of Article 9 GDPR consent fell within the scope of this Inquiry.  I noted, in the Draft Decision, that there was no evidence that Meta Ireland processes special category data at all in respect of the Instagram service.  As set out in paragraph 32 of the Decision, the EDPB has taken a different view, in the Article 65 Decision. \n \n137.\tHaving reviewed and considered all of the material submitted by NOYB, I concluded, in the Draft Decision that the core of the issues raised by NOYB were as follows: \n \na.\tAccepting the Instagram Terms of Use offered by Meta Ireland in May 2018 specifically constituted an act of consent to personal data processing under the GDPR.  The precise extent of the processing complained of is unclear in the Complaint.  A particular focus was, however, placed on both processing in order to deliver behavioural advertising, and on special category data.  NOYB also took issue with any unlawful processing based on this agreement, whatever that agreement’s legal character might be.   \n \nb.\tNOYB argued that 6(1)(a) GDPR, i.e. consent, is the mandatory, default lawful basis for personal data processing where there is a contract or agreement primarily concerned with personal data processing, or where the “declaration of intent” of the parties primarily concerns data processing.  \n \nc.\tConsent under the GDPR is simply an indication of agreement by the data subject according to NOYB.  The necessary attributes of freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous are merely “conditions for its validity”, but not features of objective “consent”. \n \nd.\tAs an alternative to point (a), Meta Ireland is not entitled to rely on the “necessary for the performance of a contract” legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR other than for very limited processing such as friends lists, photo albums, profiles and news.  It therefore cannot rely on \nthis as an alternative legal basis to consent for the acceptance of the Terms of Use as a whole.  In this regard, NOYB argued that the “purpose” of the contract (in this case, the delivery of a social media service) must be considered.  \n \ne.\tOn the basis of the above, NOYB contended that clicking accept was an attempt by Meta Ireland to seek consent under the GDPR but did not constitute not valid consent.  NOYB described this as “forced consent”, in that the only choice a user had in May 2018 was to delete his/her account and stop using the service, and “hidden consent”, in that some of the description of the Instagram service in the Terms of Use implicitly relies on processing of personal data.  \n \nf.\tNOYB contended that Meta Ireland leads data subjects to believe that it relies on consent as lawful basis for personal data processing and/or is not transparent about its lawful bases for processing personal data.  \n \n138.\tOn the other hand, Meta Ireland argued that it forms a contract with its users for the use of its (free) Instagram service.  The Commission observes that this is delivered in the form of a “Click Wrap” agreement that the user signs up to when clicking “Agree to Terms” on the Terms of Use and it looks similar to an industry standard format for such agreements.  According to Meta Ireland, its intention was to rely on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (necessary for the performance of a contract) for processing carried out on foot of the acceptance of the Terms of Use (and, for other separate processing, it would rely on other legal bases). \n \n139.\tIn this regard, Meta Ireland claimed that the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract with the Instagram user.  Meta Ireland further alleged that the Instagram Data Policy further sets out, in more detail, the other legal bases that would be relied on for other processing operations.  Meta Ireland does not agree that it sought to persuade users that consent was the legal basis for all personal data processing. \n \n140.\tThe Investigator analysed the arguments made by NOYB in the original Complaint submitted.  It seemed to me, when preparing the Draft Decision, that this was a sensible and correct approach.  This was not an “own volition” Inquiry where the Commission was entitled to scope matters of risk which it decided warranted investigation.  While it is normally the role of the Investigator to focus on the establishment of facts, to set out what elements of the GDPR are engaged against those facts, to come to a preliminary view on whether there are likely infringements identified which will then be the subject of further legal analysis and ultimately decision-making by the Commission, this case is somewhat different.  \n \n141.\tBy reference to the above approach, the facts to be established are fairly limited and largely relate to the wording of the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, in addition to the User Engagement Flow introduced in May 2018 to guide users through the process of acceptance process.  In fact, it appears \nto me that the Investigator ended up devoting time responding to legal and theoretical assertions of NOYB, such as the argument that consent is a lex specialis and therefore the mandatory legal basis where a contract primarily concerns personal data processing.  Consequently, the Final Report contains more legal analysis and argument than might otherwise have been the case (relative to a draft decision).  I have considered all of the analysis of the Investigator carefully and, in some instances, I adopt it and concur with it.  In other instances, I reject it, replace it, and explain why. \n \n142.\tAnother feature of the Complaint is a section entitled “Applications”. In this section, NOYB requested an investigation of a very specific nature, and sets out the corrective powers that NOYB believed should be imposed i.e. an administrative fine and a prohibition on the “relevant processing operations”. This section asked that the Commission: \n \n“fully investigates this complaint, by especially using its powers under Article 58(1)(a), (e) and (f) of the GDPR, to particularly determine the following facts: \n(i.)\twhich processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the personal data of the data subject, \n(ii.)\tfor which purpose they are performed, \n(iii.)\ton which legal basis for each specific processing operation the controller relies on and \n(iv.)\the/she additionally requests that a copy of any records of processing activities (Article 30 of the GDPR) are acquired.” \n \n143.\tThe right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority is governed by Article 77 GDPR. Article 77(1) states how a complaint may be made: “every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority…if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation” [emphasis added].  Neither the request above, nor a request to impose specified corrective powers, can be considered to constitute part of a complaint made in accordance with Article 77(1) GDPR.  NOYB does not specify any processing operations or any alleged infringements of the GDPR in the above request, but simply asks the Commission to gather information on its behalf.  As I have stated above, neither the GDPR nor the 2018 Act confer a particular right on a Complainant to make such a request, nor to specify what corrective powers should be imposed in circumstances where the supervisory authority is of the view that an infringement has occurred/is occurring.  To the extent that such an approach might be provided for in Belgian law, I have already set out in detail why I do not accept that such law is applicable to the exercise of my functions. \n \n144.\tIn those circumstances, it was for the Investigator, and ultimately for me as decision-maker, to carry out an objective reading of the Complaint.  In so doing, I must consider not only the content of the Complaint, but also the legal framework by which the Commission is bound.  It is also necessary that an inquiry conducted on foot of a complaint must be feasible and workable.  According to Article 77(1) GDPR, a complaint should relate to data processing that, in a complainant’s view, infringes the GDPR.  There is a lack of reasonable specificity in the above request in relation to processing operations or alleged infringements. \n \n145.\tAny request to investigate all processing, or hypothetical processing, particularly a request of such an indefinite nature, does not, in my view, conform to the requirements of Article 77 GDPR.  Such a request does not specify any data processing or any alleged infringement, and would result in a practically unworkable inquiry.  Rather than being a complaint about specific processing operations, the Complaint in this matter has, at times, strayed into the territory of instructing the Commission to conduct an open-ended inquiry, and to direct that inquiry and the Commission’s resources in a manner determined by NOYB.  It is instead for the Commission to decide on the manner in which a reasonably specific Complaint is to be investigated. \n \n146.\tI set out my views as to scope (as outlined above) in the Preliminary Draft.  In response, Meta Ireland submitted that the Complaint was limited to “forced consent” and that the Commission’s analysis and consideration of this Complaint must accordingly be limited to “forced consent”.   In support of this position, Meta Ireland cited the EDPB’s Guidelines 09/2020 on relevant and reasoned objections under Regulation 2016/679 which define a complaint-based inquiry as being one which is “defined by the aspects addressed by the complaint or report”.   In essence, it is Meta Ireland’s position that the Commission ought not have considered matters relating to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Meta Ireland’s compliance with the transparency obligations. \n \n147.\tThe Complaint, as Meta Ireland correctly pointed out, concerns what is referred to as “forced consent”.  In making this Complaint, it is argued that there has been an attempt to mislead on Meta Ireland’s part. Indeed, the Complaint rests on the allegation that Meta Ireland attempted to mislead the Complainant and users generally by informing them that they were required to consent to certain processing in order to remain an Instagram user. Following submissions from Meta Ireland to the effect that it was not relying on consent but instead the performance of the contract as a legal basis, NOYB went on to argue that the agreement had the appearance of consent, and that this in itself was misleading. The Complainant has repeated this argument in the submissions on the Preliminary \nDraft.  \n \n148.\tIn the Draft Decision, I agreed with Meta Ireland to some extent that the Complaint primarily outlined concerns as to “forced consent”, however, I was of the view that the Complaint was not solely limited to consent.  Rather, as I have outlined above, I expressed the view, in the Draft Decision, that the Complaint concerned the legal basis of the processing503 and, where Meta Ireland had not sought to rely on consent as the legal basis, it followed that the Commission was entitled to investigate and consider the legal basis which Meta Ireland has in fact sought to rely on.  In terms of the transparency \nof the information provided, I would emphasise that the Complaint explicitly alleged that the information provided on the legal bases (in the privacy policy) is such that data subjects “can only guess what data is processed, for which exact purpose and on which legal basis. This is inherently nontransparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c)”.   I expressed the view, in the Draft Decision, that this clearly concerned the transparency of the information provided and, accordingly, I was of the view that it fell within the scope of the Complaint. \n \n149.\tAccordingly, I was satisfied, as outlined in the Draft Decision, that the Complaint did raise issues relating to (i) legal basis more generally and (ii) transparency in providing such information. \n \n150.\tThe Decision (incorporating this Schedule) therefore reflects the outcome of my determination on the matters relating to the procedural and scope issues.  The conclusions on scope reflected in this Schedule 1 must read in conjunction with both Section 2 of this Decision as well as the corresponding assessment and determination of the scope of the Complaint made by the EDPB in the Article 65 Decision, as summarised at paragraph 32 of the Decision. \n \n \t  \nAppendix 2 – The Article 65 Decision \n \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.907788454Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/EDPB-Final-IG-Dec-22":{"title":"","content":"**Binding Decision 4/2022 on the dispute submitted by the Irish SA on Meta Platforms Ireland Limited and its Instagram service (Art. 65 GDPR)**\n\n\n**Adopted on 5 December 2022**\n\nAdopted\n Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure (hereinafter “EDPB RoP”)3(#ftn3),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)                     The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “**EDPB**”) is to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it follows from Article 60 GDPR that the lead supervisory authority (hereinafter “**LSA**”) shall cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned (hereinafter “**CSAs**”) in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs shall exchange all relevant information with each other, and that the LSA shall, without delay, communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned.

The decision concerns the dispute arisen following a draft decision (hereinafter “**Draft Decision**”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission”, hereinafter the “**IE SA**”, also referred to in this context as the “**LSA**”) and the subsequent objections expressed by a number of CSAs (“Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde” hereinafter the “**AT SA**”; “ Der Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit” also on behalf of other German SAs[[4]](#_ftn4), hereinafter the “**DE SAs**”; “Agencia Española de Protección de Datos”, hereinafter the “**ES SA**”; “Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman”, hereinafter the “**FI SA**”; “Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés\", hereinafter the “**FR SA**”; “Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, hereinafter “**HU SA**”; “Garante per la protezione dei dati personali\", hereinafter the “**IT SA**”; “Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”, hereinafter the “**NL SA**” ; “Datatilsynet”, hereinafter the “**NO SA**”; and “Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten”, hereinafter the “**SE SA**”). \n\n2.             The Draft Decision at issue relates to a “complaint-based inquiry” which was commenced by the IE SA on 20 August 2018 into the Instagram social media processing activities (hereinafter “**Instagram service”**) of Facebook Ireland Limited, a company established in Dublin, Ireland. The company has subsequently changed its name to “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited” and hereinafter it is referred to as “**Meta IE**”. Any reference to Meta IE in this Binding Decision means a reference to either Facebook Ireland Limited or Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, as appropriate. \n\n3.             The complaint was lodged on 25 May 2018 with the Belgian supervisory authority (“Autorité de protection des données”), hereinafter the “**BE SA**” by a data subject who requested the non-profit NOYB - European Center for Digital Rights (hereinafter, “NOYB”) to represent them under Article 80(1) GDPR (both hereinafter referred to as the “**Complainant**”). The Complainant alleged a violation of the right to data protection and especially infringements of “_all the particular requirements set out in Article 4(11), Article 6(1)(a), Article 7 and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR_”, by arguing that the controller relied on a “_forced consent_”, as well as alleging misrepresentations of the controller with regard to consent and the legal basis for the processing, and consequently, an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR[[5]](#_ftn5). The complaint articulated its requests into a request to investigate, and a request to impose corrective measures[[6]](#_ftn6).  \n\n4.             On 31 May 2018, the BE SA transferred the complaint to the IE SA. The IE SA stated in its “Schedule to the Draft Decision”7 that it was satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning of the GDPR, for Meta IE, as controller, for the purpose of the cross-border processing of personal data in the context of the Instagram service.  \n\n5.             The following table presents a summary timeline of the events part of the procedure leading to the submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism:\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n|20.08.2018|The scope and legal basis of the inquiry were set out in the notice of commencement of inquiry that the IE SA sent to the parties on 20 August 2018.

The request\n\nwas made to allow the EDPB to come to a fully informed decision on the objections raised by some CSAs on the scope and conduct of the investigation. From the schedule to the Draft Decision, the EDPB Secretariat concluded that both Meta IE and the Complainant were given access to the documents requested and invited the IE SA to confirm this was indeed the case. \n\n9.             The IE SA declined the request, as it considered that the material already provided as sufficient to enable the EDPB to determine the objections referred to it,  as the draft decision provides information about the scope of the inquiry commenced for the purpose of examining the complaint, the procedural steps taken in the inquiry, the information that was collected during the course of the inquiry process, the allegations that were put to the data controller, the submissions made by the parties to the inquiry and the assessments and views of the IE SA. Further, the IE SA expressed its concern over the possibility of the EDPB concluding its decision on the basis of material which was never put to the controller concerned as part of the formulation of any allegation of potential wrongdoing. Finally, the IE SA underlined that, in accordance with Article 11(2) of the EDPB RoP, they would provide documents the Board deems necessary. \n\n10.          A matter of particular importance that was scrutinised by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Further details on this are provided in Section 2 of this Binding Decision.\n\n11.          On 5 October 2022, the decision on the completeness of the file was taken, and it was circulated by the EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB.\n\n12.          The Chair of the EDPB decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) EDPB RoP, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on account of the complexity of the subject-matter\n\nDPC's reply to NOYB of 16/01/2019\n\nDPC letter to Meta of 30/01/2019 outlining views on the scope; \n\nMeta IE response to DPC of 05/02/2019, raising procedural questions;\n\nDPC's response to Meta of 08/02/2019;\n\nEmail exchanges between DPC and Meta on 08/02 and 15/02/2019 regarding scope and procedural issues raised by NOYB;\n\nMeta IE’s Submissions of  22/02/2019 including Meta Submission of 28/09/2018 (marked up copy, of which parts\n\nMeta considered out of scope of complaint); \n\nDPC letter to NOYB of 28/03/2019 which included an update on the scope;\n\nLetter from NOYB to the IE SA dated 19 April 2019 which included further submissions on the scope\n\nNOYB's letter to DPC of 24/02/2020 raising procedural issues; \n\nDPC's reply to NOYB of 23/03/2020;\n\nDraft Inquiry report of 20/05/2020; \n\nDPC letter to NOYB  of 20/05/2020;\n\nNOYB's response to DPC of 03/06/2020;\n\nNOYB submissions on the Draft Inquiry Report of 19/08/2020;\n\nMeta IE’s Submissions on the Draft Inquiry Report of 22/06/2020;\n\nFinal Inquiry report of 18 January 2021;\n\nNOYB’s Submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision in IN-18-08-05 dated 11 June 2021; NOYB’s submission to the IE SA containing the Gallup study in attachment.  \n\n# 2 THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION\n\n13.          The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular Article 41 (right to good administration). This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB RoP. Further details were provided in the EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR[[10]](#_ftn10).   \n\n14.          The EDPB Decision “_shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the supervisory authorities concerned and binding on them_” (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is not aiming to address directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possible need for the EDPB to offer the right to be heard at the EDPB level to Meta IE, the EDPB assessed if Meta IE was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the procedure led by the LSA and the subject matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB. In particular, the EDPB assessed if all the documents containing the matters of facts and law used by the EDPB to take its decision had been previously shared with Meta IE.  \n\n15.          The EDPB notes that Meta IE has received the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard regarding all the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered by the EDPB in the context of this decision and provided its written observations[[11]](#_ftn11), which have been shared with the EDPB by the LSA. \n\n16.          Considering that Meta IE has been already heard by the IE SA on all matters of facts and of law addressed by the EDPB in its decision, the EDPB is satisfied that the Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has been respected.\n\n17.          The EDPB considers that the Complainant is not likely to be adversely affected by this Binding Decision, and consequently does not meet the conditions to be granted a right to be heard by the EDPB in line with Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, applicable case law, and Article 11 of the EDPB RoP. This is without prejudice to any right to be heard or other related rights the Complainant may have before the competent national supervisory authority(/-ies).\n\n# 3 CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION\n\n18. The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4) and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR[[12]](#_ftn12).\n\n## 3.1 Objection(s) expressed by several CSA(s) in relation to a Draft Decision\n\n19. The EDPB notes that several CSAs (AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, IT, NL, NO and SE SAs) raised objections to the Draft Decision via IMI. The objections were raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR. \n\n## 3.2 The IE SA finds the objections to the Draft Decision not relevant or reasoned and does not follow them \n\n20.          On 1 July 2022, the IE SA provided to the CSAs an analysis of the objections raised by the CSAs in the Composite Response. \n\n21.          The IE SA concluded that it would not follow the objections, as it did not consider them “_relevant_” and/or “_reasoned_”, within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR for the reasons set out in the Composite Response and below[[13]](#_ftn13).\n\n## 3.3 Admissibility of the case\n\n22.          The case at issue fulfils the elements listed by Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, since several CSAs raised objections to a draft decision of the LSA (the IE SA) within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, and the IE SA has not followed objections or rejected them for being, in its view, not relevant or reasoned. \n\n23.          The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that the current Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution should be suspended due to pending preliminary ruling proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU (hereinafter, “**CJEU**”)[[14]](#_ftn14). Meta IE refers in particular to cases C-252/21[[15]](#_ftn15) and C-446/21[[16]](#_ftn16). Following its assessment, the EDPB decides to **continue** its proceedings on this Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution, as there is no explicit legal basis for a stay of the dispute resolution procedure in EU law, nor are existing CJEU rulings on the matter conclusive for the situation of the EDPB[[17]](#_ftn17). Also, the EDPB takes into consideration the data subjects’ right to have their complaints handled within a “_reasonable period_” (Article 57(1)(f) GDPR), and to have their case handled within a reasonable time by EU bodies (Article 41 Charter). Moreover, ultimately there are remedies available to the affected parties in case of a discrepancy between the EDPB Binding Decision and CJEU rulings in the aforementioned cases[[18]](#_ftn18). \n\n24.          Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the  EDPB is competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of\n\nthe relevant and reasoned objection(s), i.e. whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR [[19]](#_ftn19). \n\n25.          The EDPB recalls that its current Decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s).\n\n## 3.4 Structure of the Binding Decision\n\n26.          For each of the objections raised, the EDPB decides on their admissibility, by assessing first whether they can be considered as a “_relevant and reasoned objection_” within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR as clarified in the Guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection[[20]](#_ftn20). \n\n27.          Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections it deems relevant and reasoned[[21]](#_ftn21). \n\n# 4 ON WHETHER THE LSA SHOULD HAVE FOUND AN INFRINGEMENT FOR LACK OF APPROPRIATE LEGAL BASIS \n\n## 4.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n28.          The IE SA concludes that the GDPR, the jurisprudence and the EDPB Guidelines do not preclude Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to carry out the personal data processing activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service[[22]](#_ftn22). Finding 2 reads “_I find the Complainant’s case is not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by Meta Ireland on 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Use[**[23]**](#_ftn23)_”  \n\n29.          The IE SA states that it does not have competence to consider substantive issues of contract law and, accordingly, its analysis is limited to the specific contract entered into by the complainant and Meta IE in respect of the Instagram service[[24]](#_ftn24). \n\n30.          The IE SA understands the complainant’s allegations as[[25]](#_ftn25):  being that, firstly, they were given a binary choice: i.e. either accept the Instagram Terms of Use and the associated Data Policy by selecting the “accept” button, or deleting their Instagram account[[26]](#_ftn26), lack of clarity on which specific legal basis Meta IE relies on for each processing operation[[27]](#_ftn27), and their concern on Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use[[28]](#_ftn28). \n\n31.          While the IE SA acknowledges that the EDPB considers in its Guidelines 2/2019[[29]](#_ftn29) that, as a general rule, processing for online behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online service under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[30]](#_ftn30), in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, IE SA concluded that Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) as legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users[[31]](#_ftn31).  Further, the IE SA states that while the examples provided in any form of EDPB guidance are helpful and instructive, they are not necessarily conclusive of the position in any specific case and indeed do not purport to be[[32]](#_ftn32). \n\n32.          The IE SA disagrees with what it defines as a “_strict threshold of ‘impossibility’ in the assessment of necessity_” proposed by the complainant and the EDPB[[33]](#_ftn33). By “_impossibility_”, IE SA refers to the argument put forward that a particular term of a contract (here, behavioural advertising) is not necessary to deliver an overall service or contract36. The IE SA is of the view that “_it is not for an authority such as the Commission, tasked with the enforcement of data protection law, to make assessments as to what will or will not make the performance of a contract possible or impossible_” and that the general principles set out in the GDPR and explained by the EDPB in the guidelines must be applied on a case-by-case basis[[34]](#_ftn34). The IE SA considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted as requiring that it is impossible to perform the contract without the data processing operations in question[[35]](#_ftn35).   \n\n33.          The IE SA refers to Meta IE’s position that in the specific context of the Instagram service, personalised advertising may constitute a distinguishing feature of said service which is an “_exact rationale_” and one of the “_essential elements of the Terms of Use_” for which the ordinary user would reasonably expect their personal data to be processed so as to receive the Instagram service as advertised39. Further, the IE SA refers to Meta IE’s submission regarding whether the necessity test encompasses an impossibility threshold, and Meta IE’s argument that were impossibility an aspect of necessity, it\n\nwould not, in any case operate as a “_blanket prohibition_” on relying on Article (1)(b) GDPR as the legal basis for the processing in this context[[36]](#_ftn36).\n\n34.          The IE SA considers personalised advertising a core part of the service offered to and accepted by the users, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by Meta IE and the user[[37]](#_ftn37). The IE SA points out that the nature of the service being offered to Instagram users is set out in the Terms of Use which describe the Instagram service as being “_personalised_” and connects users with brands, including by means of providing “_relevant_” advertising and content[[38]](#_ftn38). \n\n35.          The IE SA considers this as the Instagram service is advertised in the Terms of Use as being predicated on personalised advertising, any reasonable user would understand and expect that this is part of the core bargain that is being struck with Meta IE, even if they might prefer that the market would offer them better alternative choices[[39]](#_ftn39). \n\n36.          The IE SA considers that as personalised advertising forms part of the core bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users, any processing necessary for the delivery of such advertising is deemed to fall within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[40]](#_ftn40).\n\n37.          The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the delivery of a service based on behavioural advertising of the kind provided for under the contract between Meta IE and Instagram’s users[[41]](#_ftn41).\n\n38.          The IE SA clarified that, having regard to the scope of the complaint and its inquiry, the above conclusion ought not to be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on users’ personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR [[42]](#_ftn42). \n\n39.          The IE SA also notes that other provisions of the GDPR such as transparency act to strictly regulate the manner in which this service is to be delivered and the information that should be given to users and decides to address it separately in its Draft Decision[[43]](#_ftn43).The IE SA considers that there have been significant failings of transparency in relation to the processing 48. \n\n40.          The IE SA considers that these failings of transparency, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, do not, in principle prevent Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of the Instagram service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users[[44]](#_ftn44).\n\n## 4.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs\n\n41.          The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs  object to **Finding 2 of the draft decision** and the assessment leading up to it. \n\n42.          The AT, ES, FI, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs[[45]](#_ftn45)  consider that, **the IE SA should have found** **an infringement of** **Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR**, in line with the EDPB’s interpretation of this provision[[46]](#_ftn46). The DE and FR SAs argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR [[47]](#_ftn47). \n\n43.          The DE SAs, in their objection, further argue that the IE SA should find an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and make use of corrective powers of Article 58(2)(f) and (i) GDPR and order to erase the unlawfully processed personal data, impose a ban of the respective processing of data for the purpose of behavioural advertising until a valid legal basis is in place and impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR [[48]](#_ftn48).\n\n44.          The FI SA, in its objection, also argues that the finding that Meta IE was not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for all the processing operations in the scope of the Instagram Service should lead to the conclusion that corrective powers pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR must be exercised to bring the processing operations of Meta IE into compliance with the GDPR[[49]](#_ftn49). Furthermore, the FI SA considers that this additional infringement should be properly reflected in the amount of the administrative fine imposed pursuant to Article 83 GDPR[[50]](#_ftn50).\n\n45.          The FR SA notes that reversing the findings concerning the infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR also affects the scope of the corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative fine[[51]](#_ftn51).\n\n46.          The HU SA, in its objection, argues that in light of the infringement, the legal consequences of Article 58(2) (d) (order to bring processing operations into compliance) GDPR should be applied, and the controller should be instructed to indicate another alternative legal basis57.\n\n47.          The NO SA, in its objection, also argues that the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures. More specifically, the NO SA considers that the IE SA should order Meta IE to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, unless those data were also collected for other purposes with a valid legal basis, as well as order Meta IE to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising\n\nor abstain from such processing activities and impose an administrative fine against Meta IE for unlawfully processing personal data in the context of online behavioural advertising[[52]](#_ftn52). \n\n48.          The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs put forward several **factual and legal arguments** for the proposed change in legal assessment[[53]](#_ftn53). Specifically they argue that Meta IE cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process an Instagram user’s data for behavioural advertising.\n\n49.          In addition, in the context of their objection, the AT and FR SAs argue that the factual background of **the Draft Decision does not include all relevant facts**. They request amending the factual background to include a definition of “_behavioural advertising”_[[54]](#_ftn54). The AT SA suggests mentioning also the technical possibilities Meta IE uses to conduct it, such as collecting data from other group services, third-party websites, apps, cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the user’s computer or mobile device and linking that data with the user’s Instagram account[[55]](#_ftn55). The AT SA also suggests including the fact that on 25 May 2018 Meta IE switched its legal basis to process data for behavioural advertising from consent to contractual performance[[56]](#_ftn56).  \n\n50.          The DE and NL SAs[[57]](#_ftn57) question the **validity of the contract** between Meta IE and the Instagram service’s user to ground the said processing on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in light of the transparency issues identified by the IE SA [[58]](#_ftn58). The DE SAs question whether the parties reached an agreement if the user did not know that they would enter into a contract, because Meta IE did not clearly communicate in a transparent manner that the use of its services would in the future be based on a contract[[59]](#_ftn59). The NL SA argues that, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of a contract in order to willingly enter into it[[60]](#_ftn60) and considers that “_the established serious lack of transparency on behalf of the controller, leads, at the very least, to a reasonable doubt whether data subjects have indeed been able to enter into a contract with the controller both willingly and sufficiently informed_\"[[61]](#_ftn61). The DE and NL SAs therefore considered that Meta IE’s statement that it relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in combination with documents with general descriptions of the service provided, and the IE SA’s reference to the controller’s right to choose its own legal basis to process data are insufficient to accept the performance of a contract as a legal basis[[62]](#_ftn62). \n\n51.          The DE SAs contend that the IE SA is competent to assess the validity of contracts in the context of the GDPR, which is a prerequisite for controllers to base the processing of personal data on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[63]](#_ftn63). Would that not be the case, the assessment of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR would practically be deducted from Supervisory Authorities’ tasks provided for in Article 57(1)(a) GDPR[[64]](#_ftn64). The DE and NL SAs argue that the IE SA should assess whether a valid contract is in place as required under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[65]](#_ftn65).\n\n52.          Without prejudice to any arguments made on the existence of a valid contract above, the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs are not satisfied by the assessment of necessity in the Draft Decision[[66]](#_ftn66) . They assert that the **data processing for the delivery of personalised advertising is objectively not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s contract with the data subject to deliver the Instagram service and it is not an essential or core element of it**. To highlight the unnecessity of behavioural advertising to perform the contract with the Instagram user, the AT, DE, NL and SE SAs argue that this contract of providing personalised advertisement is a contract between Meta IE and a specific advertiser, in which Meta IE would presumably have this obligation towards the advertisers, yet not towards Instagram users that are not party to this contract[[67]](#_ftn67). The DE SAs support this assertion by pointing out that there is no obligation to offer personalised advertising to the user, and contractual sanctions for the failure to provide it, as it can be seen from the terms of use[[68]](#_ftn68). The AT, DE, HU, FI, FR, HU, NO and SE SAs consider, while referring to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that the business models to offer “_free_” services and in return generate income by behavioural and personalised advertisement, inter alia, to support the service, cannot be necessary to perform a contract and fail to comply with data protection regulations[[69]](#_ftn69). The DE, FR and HU SAs also cite the EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 to underscore that processing cannot be rendered lawful by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR simply because such advertising indirectly funds the provision of the service and that while personalisation of content, may, in certain circumstances, constitute an intrinsic and expected element of certain online services, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of targeting of social media users is hardly applicable[[70]](#_ftn70). The AT, ES and SE SAs argue that advertisements can still be displayed on Instagram using alternative methods to behavioural advertising not involving profiling and tracking[[71]](#_ftn71). The SE SA adds that some degree of targeting for increased relevance is possible, such as geography, language and context 78. \n\n53.          In addition, the AT, ES, FI, FR, HU, NO and SE SAs argue, also while referring to EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that the IE SA should have considered the EDPB’s argument that behavioural advertising cannot be “necessary” within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR while a data subject can object to the processing of his/her personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time without any reason, in accordance with Article 21(2) GDPR [[72]](#_ftn72). \n\n54.          The AT, DE, FR, NO, NL and SE SAs  also point out some arguments on **data subjects’ expectations about the processing** of their personal data for personalised advertising as a necessary element of the contract entered into between users and Meta IE[[73]](#_ftn73). The AT, DE, NL, and SE SAs contend that data subjects do not reasonably expect that their data is being processed for personalised advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to it in the Instagram Terms of Use[[74]](#_ftn74). The NO SA takes into account how Meta IE markets its Instagram platform towards potential users (“_A simple, fun \u0026 creative way to capture, edit \u0026 share photos, videos \u0026 messages with friends \u0026 family_”) and considers that Instagram users (including those with prior knowledge of data protection, technical means for profiling or the ad tech industry) should not be deemed to reasonably expect online behavioural advertising, especially to the extent as it is carried out by Meta IE[[75]](#_ftn75). The FR and NO SAs consider that the particularly massive and intrusive nature of the processing of the users’ data cannot meet the reasonable expectations of the users[[76]](#_ftn76). The AT, NL and SE SAs also consider that the Draft Decision is inconsistent in finding that information on specific processing operations should have been provided, linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described in an unambiguous manner, while considering that data subjects had a perspective or expectation or were well informed that their data was being processed for behavioural advertising[[77]](#_ftn77). \n\n55.          In addition to the arguments made above on the existence of a valid contract and the necessity of behavioural advertising for the performance of that contract, several SAs raise other considerations in their objections. \n\n56.          The NO SA argues that the IE SA’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) is contrary to the fairness principle, since data subjects face the dilemma of approving contractual terms possibly entailing intrusive and harmful processing practices, and being excluded from services on which they are _de facto_ dependent, due to a lack of realistic alternatives to them[[78]](#_ftn78). \n\n57.          On the **risks** posed by the Draft Decision, the AT, DE, ES, HU, FI, NL, NO and SE SAs explain that the proposed interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR leads to a situation where data protection principles are either undermined or bypassed entirely with regards to data subjects using the Instagram service[[79]](#_ftn79) . \n\n58.          Specifically, the AT, DE and NO SAs point to the conditions of consent pursuant to Article 7 GDPR as being bypassed[[80]](#_ftn80). The NL SA considers that the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to engage in online behavioural advertising in a way that bypasses informed consent of data subjects[[81]](#_ftn81). The NO SA considers that users ‘_would face a dilemma between approving (though not by way of valid consent) contractual terms possibly entailing intrusive and harmful processing practices, and being excluded from services’_, which ultimately would also _‘adversely affect data subjects’ freedom of expression and information’ [**[82]**](#_ftn82)_. The FI, FR and NO SAs considered that the Draft Decision poses a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, insofar as using the legal basis of the contract for the processing of the personal data for personalised advertising, would prevent European users of the social network to have control over their data [[83]](#_ftn83)_._\n\n59.          Further, the AT SA sees the risk materialise as in its view Article 25(2) GDPR (privacy by default) is not applied, “_since Meta Ireland – at least in its contract – declares that behavioural advertising is ‘necessary’ for the contractual performance_”[[84]](#_ftn84).\n\n60.          The DE SAs argue the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to “_bypass the requirements of a valid legal basis for the processing that cannot be based on contract performance”_ [[85]](#_ftn85). The NL SA considers the Draft Decision lowers the threshold for legality of data processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) severely [[86]](#_ftn86). The NO SA considers that the Draft Decision erodes the lawfulness principle, as in the Draft Decision “_it is not the legislation which sets the boundaries for lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, but instead the individual contract”,_ which is incompatible with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR [[87]](#_ftn87).\n\n61.          FR, HU, NL and SE SAs take the view that the Draft Decision, as it stands, sets a dangerous precedent contrary to the GDPR[[88]](#_ftn88).  The FR SA notes that it could be understood as reflecting the common position of the European supervisory authorities on this matter, since it is issued following the cooperation procedure among SAs[[89]](#_ftn89). Moreover, the AT, DE, FI, HU and SE SAs raise that this interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could essentially be used by every controller and therefore endanger the rights of nearly every data subject within the EEA[[90]](#_ftn90). \n\n62.          The DE SAs specify that the risks concern the complainant in person but it argues that there is also a significant risk as regard the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Meta IE’s users in the European Union that their personal data are processed without any legal basis[[91]](#_ftn91); the FI SA adds that the risks include fundamental right and freedom of data subjects whose personal data might be processed in the future[[92]](#_ftn92).\n\n63.          Finally, the AT, DE, FI, NL and NO SAs explain that the Draft Decision creates a loophole, allowing Meta IE and any other controllers to make lawful virtually any collection and reuse of personal data by, as long as they declare that it is processed for the performance of a contract[[93]](#_ftn93).\n\n## 4.3 Position of the LSA on the objections\n\n64.          The IE SA considers that the objections above are not relevant and/or not reasoned for the purpose of Article 60(4) GDPR and decides not to follow them[[94]](#_ftn94). \n\n65.          The IE SA contends that a broad, direct competence in contract law to assess **the validity of contracts** cannot be inferred from the GDPR tasks of supervisory authorities. It argues that this inference would create a very extensive power for SAs to regulate private law, without an appropriate basis in EU law[[95]](#_ftn95). \n\n66.          The IE SA argues that the core or fundamental aspects of the Terms of Use, including behavioural advertising processing, reflects the mutual expectations of the parties on contractual performance. The IE SA contends that a reasonable user would have had sufficient understanding that the Instagram service was provided on the basis of personalised advertising, based also on a “_recognised public awareness_” of behavioural advertising as a form of processing [[96]](#_ftn96).\n\n67.          On the **necessity of the processing to perform the contract**, the IE SA considers that it does not adopt a merely formal approach to Article 6(1)(b) that relies only on the textual content of the Terms of Use. The IE SA states that it does not take the view that all written contractual terms are necessary for the performance of the contract. The IE SA contends that it focuses in its Draft Decision on the fundamental purpose or core function of the contract that is necessary for its performance[[97]](#_ftn97).\n\n68.          The IE SA argues that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not prohibit behavioural advertising processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR if it falls within the core or essential aspects of the service[[98]](#_ftn98). In relation to Meta IE’s processing of personal data, the IE SA differs from the SAs in that it considers online behavioural advertising as necessary for the performance of the contract (as described in the Instagram Terms of Use) between Instagram and the data subject[[99]](#_ftn99).  \n\n69.          The IE SA also disagrees with the interpretation of Article 21 GDPR making behavioural advertising optional and not indispensable[[100]](#_ftn100). The IE SA argues that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is not limited to aspects of contractual performance which are expressly mandatory and unconditional obligations of the parties[[101]](#_ftn101). The IE SA contends that the CJEU has in the past held that processing which exceeds the most minimal level of processing possible may be regarded as necessary, where it renders a lawful objective “_more effective_”. The IE SA  affirms that the necessity in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be assessed by reference to hypothetical alternative forms of the Instagram service and that it is not the role of SAs to impose specific business models on controllers[[102]](#_ftn102).  \n\n70.          The IE SA considers EDPB Guidelines as not binding on supervisory authorities, yet it acknowledges that they should be taken into account[[103]](#_ftn103). However, the IE SA argues that the EDPB has not been provided with the legal power to mandate that certain categories of processing must be based on consent, to the exclusion of any other legal bases for processing.  The IE SA’s view is that such a power is properly exercised from time to time by the EU legislator, in the form of specific legislative measures.  The IE SA is therefore not satisfied that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be construed as a binding and specific prohibition on processing for online behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b)GDPR. The IE SA considers that under these Guidelines, where processing for behavioural advertising is a distinguishing characteristic of the service in question, it can support the business objectives and interests of the controller and be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA considers that to be the case regarding Meta IE’s processing with reference to the Instagram service[[104]](#_ftn104). \n\n71.          The IE SA  argues that compliance with GDPR transparency obligations under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR involves a separate and different legal assessment to that required in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA acknowledges that the necessity test under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR may require considering contractual terms and other relevant information, and that the information provided under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR could, in some cases,  inform a data subject’s expectations as to a contractual service. However, in the present case, the IE SA considers that the transparency infringements it proposes for its Draft Decision do not impact its findings on the legal basis, as it considers that the expectations and understanding of the parties on the Terms of Use include personalised advertising[[105]](#_ftn105). \n\n## 4.4 Assessment of the EDPB\n\n### 4.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned\n\n72.          The objections raised by the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs concern “_whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”_[[106]](#_ftn106). \n\n73.          The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR[[107]](#_ftn107). Meta IE’s primary argument is that _“it is not open to the EDPB to now decide on the lawfulness of Meta Ireland’s actual processing as the Objections suggest. Such an assessment is not within the scope of the Inquiry as defined by the DPC115.”_ In Meta IE’s view, “_the EDPB cannot expand the scope of the Inquiry in the manner suggested by the CSAs through Objections_\n\n_that are not relevant to the substance of the Complaint_.” and “_such objections ‘ought to be disregarded in their entirety by the EDPB”_[[108]](#_ftn108). In this context, Meta IE cites EDPB Binding Decision 2/2022, adopted on 28 July 2022 (hereinafter, “EDPB Binding Decision 2/2022”), and in particular, the EDPB’s analysis of some of the objections in that case, which were found to be not relevant or reasoned, due to the fact that these objections _“fail[ed] to establish a direct connection with the specific legal and factual content of the draft decision”_[[109]](#_ftn109)_._  \n\n74.          Contrary to Meta IE’s position on relevance, as described above, objections can have bearing on the _“specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision”_, despite not aligning with the scope of the inquiry as defined by an LSA[[110]](#_ftn110). \n\n75.          In essence, Meta IE argues that CSAs may not, under any circumstance, express disagreement with the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection. The EDPB does not share this reading of Article 65 GDPR, as is explicitly stated in the EDPB RRO Guidelines[[111]](#_ftn111). \n\n76.          Further, Meta IE states that “_several CSAs now propose to expand the scope of the Inquiry even further to include many other unrelated issues_.” and that in this regard Meta IE “_agrees with the DPC’s position in the Composite Memo that these unrelated issues raised by the CSAs are irrelevant to the resolution of this Inquiry and that expanding the scope of the Inquiry at this point would seriously infringe Meta Ireland’s procedural rights under both Irish and EU law120_.” Meta IE also agrees with the IE SA’s position in the Composite Response that “_expanding the scope of the Inquiry at this point as the CSAs propose would seriously infringe Meta Ireland’s legitimate expectations, right to fair procedures (including the_  \n\n_right to be heard) and rights of defence_[[112]](#_ftn112)_”_. Despite claiming it this has been explained “_clearly”_ in the Composite Response, Meta IE does not demonstrate in which manner its procedural rights would be inevitably breached by the mere fact that the EDPB finds specific objections admissible[[113]](#_ftn113). Admissibility determines the competence of the EDPB, but not the outcome of the dispute between the LSA and the CSAs. Likewise, Meta IE does not explain how the mere act of considering the merits of admissible objections inevitably and irreparably breaches the procedural rights cited by Meta IE [[114]](#_ftn114).  Accepting Meta IE’s interpretation would severely limit the EDPB possibility to resolve disputes arising in the one-stop-shop, and thus undermine the consistent application of the GDPR. \n\n77.          The objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs all have a direct connection with the LSA Draft Decision and refer to a specific part of the Draft Decision, i.e. Finding 2. All of those objections concern _“whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”_ as they argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6, 6(1) or (1)(b) of the GDPR. As the LSA considered that Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR was not breached, the objections entail a need of a change of the LSA decision leading to a different conclusion. Consequently, the EDPB finds that the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs objections relating to the infringement of Article 6, 6(1) or 6(1)(b) GDPR are **relevant**. \n\n78.          As regards the part of the DE SAs’ objection arguing that the IE SA should find an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and impose the erasure of unlawfully processed personal data and the ban of the processing of data for the purpose of behavioural advertising until a valid legal basis is in place, the part of the FI SA objection asking that the infringement of Article 6(1) be properly reflected in the amount of the administrative fine, as well as the part of the NO SA objection arguing the IE SA should order Meta IE to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as well as order Meta IE to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising or from now on abstain from such processing activities, the EDPB notes that these parts of the objections concern _“whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR_.” These parts of the objections are linked to the IE SA’s Finding 2 with regard to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Therefore, they are directly connected with the substance of the Draft Decision and, if followed, would lead to a different conclusion. Thus, the EDPB considers that these parts of the DE, FI and NO SAs objections are **relevant**.\n\n79.          The objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs on the finding of an infringement are **reasoned** because they all include clarifications and arguments on legal/factual mistakes in the LSA’s Draft Decision that require amending. More specifically, the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs provide detailed arguments to challenge the Draft Decision’s consideration of behavioural advertising as a **necessary**, core or fundamental aspect of a contract leading to the need to change the decision and to find an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[115]](#_ftn115). Some of them provide detailed arguments challenging the validity of the contract on which the use of Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis depends and which the IE SA accepts[[116]](#_ftn116). \n\n80.          Some SAs recall, while referring to the terms of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that it is the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose, which justifies that the processing is necessary[[117]](#_ftn117). This purpose is not only based on the controller’s perspective but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract and thus on _“the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract”._ The AT, NL, and SE SAs contend that data subjects do not reasonably expect that their data is being processed for personalised advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to it in the Instagram Terms of Use[[118]](#_ftn118).  The FR and NO SAs also support this finding and add that data subjects cannot be presumed to be aware of the particularly massive and intrusive nature of this processing[[119]](#_ftn119). Several SAs also consider that the Draft Decision is inconsistent in finding that information on specific processing operations should have been provided, linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described in an unambiguous manner, while considering that data subjects had a perspective or expectation or were well informed that their data was being processed for behavioural advertising[[120]](#_ftn120). \n\n81.          The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs objections also identify risks posed by the Draft Decision, in particular an interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) that could be invoked by any controller and would undermine or bypass data protection principles, and thus endanger the rights of data subjects within the EEA[[121]](#_ftn121). \n\n82.          Meta IE’s contends that in terms of risk, the objections must “demonstrate the likelihood of a direct negative impact of a certain significance of the Draft Decision on fundamental rights and freedoms under the Charter and not just any data subject rights[[122]](#_ftn122).” Meta IE thus adds a condition to Article 4(24) GDPR, which is not supported by the GDPR[[123]](#_ftn123). \n\n83.          As regards the parts of the DE and NO SAs’ objections requesting the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and the parts of the DE, FI and NO SAs’ objections requesting specific corrective measures under Article 58 GDPR for the infringement of Article 6(1) or 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely the imposition of an administrative fine, a ban of the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and an order to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising or to abstain from such processing activities, the EDPB considers that these parts of the objections do not sufficiently elaborate the legal or factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision leading to the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR or to the imposition of the specific corrective measures mentioned above. Likewise, the significance of the risk for the data subjects, which stems from the IE SA’s decision not to conclude on the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and not to impose the requested corrective measures, is not sufficiently demonstrated. \n\n84.          Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs are relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR. \n\n85.          However, the parts of the DE and NO SAs’ objections concerning the additional infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the imposition of specific  corrective measures, namely the imposition of an administrative fine, a ban on the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and an order to identify a valid legal basis for future behavioural advertising or to abstain from such processing activities are not reasoned and do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR Similarly, the part of the FI SA’s objection concerning the imposition of a specific corrective measure, namely an administrative fine is not reasoned and does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n### 4.4.2 Assessment on the merits\n\n86.          In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR. \n\n87.          The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it rejects the Complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its offering of the Instagram Terms of Use[[124]](#_ftn124). When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions.\n\n##### Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions\n\n88.          In its submissions, Meta IE argues that the objections lack merit. Meta IE considers that they are based on incorrect factual assumptions and are legally flawed[[125]](#_ftn125). Meta IE states that its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not ‘bypass’ the GDPR. Nor would it, according to Meta IE, jeopardise data subject rights, be limited to individually negotiated agreements or be affected by Meta IE’s purported preGDPR legal basis for processing conducted pre-GDPR[[126]](#_ftn126).  \n\n89.          Meta IE argues that there is a lack of factual material and evidence on the issues on which the CSAs raise objections, including on its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the specific processing operations it conducts in its Instagram service for the purposes of behavioural advertising[[127]](#_ftn127). Meta IE notes that in its inquiry, the IE SA “_only addresses the issue of whether Meta Ireland may_ in principle _rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for purpose of behavioural advertising, but not the issue of whether Meta Ireland_\n\n_may in fact rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which would have required a detailed factual assessment of all of Meta Ireland’s data processing_. [[128]](#_ftn128)“\n\n90.          At the same time, Meta IE contends that, to address the complaint, the IE SA did not have to reach any conclusions as to whether the actual processing conducted by Meta IE to deliver behavioural advertising based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was lawful. 138 Meta IE supports the IE’s position that “_it would not be appropriate to undertake substantial factual findings for an open-ended assessment of all processing operations by Meta Ireland.[**[129]**](#_ftn129)”_\n\n91.          Meta IE thus agrees with the finding the IE SA reached on Meta IE’s not being precluded from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of data necessary to deliver behavioural advertising upon the IE SA’s review of the Instagram Terms of Use and the nature of the Instagram service as described in those terms140. \n\n92.          Meta IE defends that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be relied on as a legal basis for behavioural advertising[[130]](#_ftn130). Meta IE argues that its application requires the assessment of whether a given data processing operation, when properly investigated and analysed, is actually necessary for the performance of a contract[[131]](#_ftn131). Meta IE notes that the provision of a personalised experience, including in the form of behavioural advertising, is “_core_” to the Instagram Service (as per the Terms of Use which govern the contractual relationship between Meta IE and Instagram users)[[132]](#_ftn132). \n\n93.          Meta IE argues that the Terms of Use make clear that users will be shown advertising personalised to their interests under the heading _“Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about”_[[133]](#_ftn133)_._ Meta IE supports the DPC’s finding, based on its review of the Instagram Terms of Use and that Instagram is “_promoted as such_”, that an average user who accepts the Terms of Use would have the expectation that personalisation, including in the form of behavioural advertising, forms a core and integral part of the Instagram of Service[[134]](#_ftn134). Meta IE backs this argument with a reference to a survey and a study conducted by a private entity and a digital industry association[[135]](#_ftn135). Meta IE considers that its compliance with the GDPR’s transparency obligations involves a separate and different legal assessment from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[136]](#_ftn136). Meta IE considers demonstrated in this case that Meta IE and its users have a mutual expectation that personalisation, including in the form of behavioural ads, is core to its Terms of Use148. \n\n94.          Meta IE recalls that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not categorically prohibit reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for behavioural advertising[[137]](#_ftn137). Meta IE further adds, referring to the CJEU’s _Huber_ judgment, that _“processing beyond the most minimal required to achieve the processing purpose could still be deemed ‘necessary’ if it allowed the relevant processing purpose to be ‘more effectively’ achieved”_[[138]](#_ftn138). Meta IE submits that even if Article 6(1)(b) GDPR required the processing to be absolutely essential to perform the contract, it would be impossible to provide the Instagram Service in accordance with the Term of Use without providing behavioural advertising[[139]](#_ftn139). Meta IE states that the EDPB may not dictate the nature of the services Meta IE provides. Meta IE would view this as a violation of Article 16 of the Charter on the freedom to conduct a business, enabling service providers to determine what measures to take in order to achieve the result they seek, based on their resources, abilities, and compatibility with other obligations and challenges they may encounter in the exercise of their activity[[140]](#_ftn140). \n\n95.          Meta IE further argues that its reliance on the contractual necessity legal basis does not jeopardise data subject rights[[141]](#_ftn141). Meta IE considers that these would also be protected by contract and consumer protection legislations in the EU Member States[[142]](#_ftn142). Meta IE defends that the contractual necessity legal basis is not limited to individually negotiated agreements and can also be used for standard form contracts[[143]](#_ftn143). Meta IE further adds that it would be improper for CSAs and the EDPB to analyse the validity of Instagram Terms of Use under applicable laws of contract or to draw inferences from them[[144]](#_ftn144). In response to what Meta IE considers mischaracterisations in certain objections of national contract law Meta IE provides expert reports on the validity of its Terms of Use in 10 Member States[[145]](#_ftn145). \n\n96.          Meta IE concludes its arguments in support of its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR stating that its preGDPR legal basis for data processing does not affect its flexibility to rely on other legal bases post GDPR if it complies with the relevant requirements[[146]](#_ftn146). Meta IE also distinguishes behavioural advertising on the Instagram Service from direct marketing pursuant to Article 21(2) GDPR and thus considers this provision not applicable to behavioural advertising [[147]](#_ftn147). \n\n##### The EDPB’s assessment of the merits\n\n97.          The EDPB considers it necessary to begin its assessment on the merits with a general description of the practice of behavioural advertising carried out in the context of the Instagram service before determining whether the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is appropriate for this practice in the present case, based on the Instagram Terms of Use and the nature of its products and features as described in those terms. The requests for preliminary rulings made to the CJEU in the cases C-252/21 and C-446/21 to which some of the documents in the file refer contain helpful descriptions of Meta’s behavioural advertising practices in the context of its Facebook services[[148]](#_ftn148)[[149]](#_ftn149). Given that behavioural advertising is also carried out in the context of the Instagram service, and given the similarities between the two services, relying on the same Data Policy[[150]](#_ftn150), the EDPB considers that these cases are also useful in gaining an understanding of the practice of behavioural advertising in relation to the Instagram service. Furthermore, in the request for a preliminary ruling in case C-252/21, it is mentioned that if the CJEU answers the question 7 positively (regarding the competence of a Member State national competition authority to determine, when assessing the balance of interests whether data processing and their terms comply with the GDPR) that the questions 3 to 5 must be answered in relation to data from the use of the group’s Instagram service. [[151]](#_ftn151) In addition, Meta IE makes reference to both of these requests for preliminary rulings in its submissions, and therefore clearly considers them relevant to this case[[152]](#_ftn152).\n\n98.          These requests for preliminary rulings mention that Meta IE collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device[[153]](#_ftn153). According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its  \n\nusers free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way. \n\n99.          The EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook service, as well as off the Facebook service itself, through third party websites and apps which are connected to Facebook.com via programming interfaces (“Facebook Business Tools”), including the Instagram service[[154]](#_ftn154). Furthermore, among the aspects described in the Instagram Terms of Use is “_Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products_.” which involves “_shar[ing] technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you_.” It is therefore clear that personal data is shared between Facebook companies (”_We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads (...)_”\n\n100.      These are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and expect behavioural advertising when they accept the Instagram Terms of Use and perceive it as necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service[[155]](#_ftn155).  Accordingly, the EDPB further considers that the IE SA could have added to its Draft Decision a description of behavioural advertising that Meta IE conducts through the Instagram service to appropriately substantiate its reasoning leading to its acceptance of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for that practice in accordance with the IE SA’s duty to state the reasons for an individual decision[[156]](#_ftn156). \n\n101.      Notwithstanding the EDPB’s considerations above, the EDPB considers that there is sufficient information in the file for the EDPB to decide whether the IE SA needs to change its Draft Decision insofar as it rejects the complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its offering of the Instagram service, based on its Terms of Use.\n\n102.      As described above in section 4.1., the IE SA concludes in Finding 2 of its Draft Decision that the Complainant’s case was not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by Meta IE on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Use, neither Article 6(1)(b) GDPR nor any other provision of the GDPR precludes Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to deliver\n\na service, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service[[157]](#_ftn157). The IE SA considers that, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its Instagram service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of its service offered to and accepted by its users[[158]](#_ftn158). The IE SA considers the core of the service offered by Meta IE is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising [[159]](#_ftn159). The IE SA considers a reasonable user would understand and expect this having read the Terms of Use[[160]](#_ftn160). Meta IE supports this conclusion of the IE SA[[161]](#_ftn161).\n\n103.      To assess these claims of the IE SA and Meta IE, the EDPB considers it necessary to recall the general objectives that the GDPR pursues, which must guide its interpretation, together with the wording of its provisions and its normative context[[162]](#_ftn162).\n\n104.      The GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the TFEU, which constitute EU primary law[[163]](#_ftn163). As the CJEU clarified_, “an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law”[**[164]**](#_ftn164)_. In the face of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and sharing, the GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control of their own personal data[[165]](#_ftn165). By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection throughout the EU, the GDPR seeks to ensure the free movement of personal data within the EU[[166]](#_ftn166). The GDPR acknowledges that the right to data protection needs to be balanced against other fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to conduct a business, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and has these considerations integrated into its provisions[[167]](#_ftn167). The GDPR, pursuant to EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to a data subject and his/her dignity, and not as a commodity data subjects can trade away through a contract[[168]](#_ftn168). The CJEU provided additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests[[169]](#_ftn169). \n\n105.      The principle of lawfulness of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to the protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process the personal data of individuals if it is able to rely on one of the bases found in the exhaustive and restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR[[170]](#_ftn170). \n\n106.      The principle of lawfulness goes hand in hand with the principles of fairness and transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller[[171]](#_ftn171). \n\n107.      The EDPB agrees with the IE SA and Meta IE that there is no hierarchy between these legal bases[[172]](#_ftn172). However, this does not mean that a controller, as Meta IE in the present case, has absolute discretion to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller may only rely on one of the legal bases established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the processing at stake[[173]](#_ftn173). A specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet its requirements set by the GDPR and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data[[174]](#_ftn174). The legal basis will not be appropriate if its application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect _“effet utile”_ pursued by the GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR [[175]](#_ftn175). These criteria stem from the content of the GDPR and the interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given thereto described in paragraph 104 above [[176]](#_ftn176).\n\n108.      The GDPR makes Meta IE, as a data controller for the processing at stake, directly responsible for complying with the Regulation’s principles, including the processing of data in a lawful, fair and transparent manner, and any obligations derived therefrom[[177]](#_ftn177). This obligation applies even where the practical application of GDPR principles such as those of Article 5(1)(a) and Article (5)(2) GDPR is inconvenient or runs counter to the commercial interests of Meta IE and its business model. The controller is also obliged to be able to demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations derived therefrom, such as that it meets the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis[[178]](#_ftn178).  \n\n109.      The first condition to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process the data subject’s data is that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, has to be able **to demonstrate that (a) a contract exists and (b) the contract is valid** pursuant to applicable national contract laws[[179]](#_ftn179).\n\n110.      Both the IE SA and Meta IE consider that the Terms of Use make up the entire agreement between the Instagram user and Meta IE and that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document setting out information to fulfil the GDPR transparency obligations[[180]](#_ftn180). The IE SA thus considers that the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR takes place, is the Terms of Use[[181]](#_ftn181).  \n\n111.      The IE SA and Meta IE argue that the GDPR does not confer a broad and direct competence to supervisory authorities to interpret or assess the validity of contracts[[182]](#_ftn182). \n\n112.      The EDPB agrees that SAs do not have under the GDPR a broad and general competence in contractual matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks that the GDPR bestows on SAs imply a limited competence to assess a contract’s general validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment of their tasks under the GDPR. Otherwise, the SAs would see their monitoring and enforcement task under Article 57(1)(a) GDPR limited to actions such as verifying whether the processing at stake is necessary for the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a processor under Article 28(3) GDPR and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate safeguards pursuant to the GDPR. Pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation, the SAs would thus be obliged to always consider a contract valid, even in situations where it is manifestly evident that it is not, for instance because there is no proof of agreement between the two parties, or because the contract does not comply with its Member State’s rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child[[183]](#_ftn183). \n\n113.      As the DE and NL SAs[[184]](#_ftn184) argue, the validity of the contract for the Instagram service between Meta IE and the complainant is questionable, given the strong indications that the Complainant was unaware of entering into a contract, and (as the IE SA establishes with its Finding 3 of its Draft Decision) serious transparency issues in relation to the legal basis relied on. In contract law, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of the contract and the obligations of both parties to the contract in order to willingly enter into such contract.\n\n114.      Notwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB, refers to its previous interpretative guidance on this matter to provide below its **analysis on whether behavioural advertising is objectively necessary** for Meta IE to provide its Instagram service to the user based on its Terms of Use and the nature of the service[[185]](#_ftn185).  \n\n115.      The EDPB recalls[[186]](#_ftn186) that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, _“[i]t is important to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance”_[[187]](#_ftn187). As the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject199.\n\n116.      Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract[[188]](#_ftn188).\n\n117.      The IE SA accepts the EDPB’s position that, as a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services[[189]](#_ftn189). However, the IE SA considers that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the Instagram service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users[[190]](#_ftn190). \n\n118.      The IE SA views behavioural advertising as “_the core of both Meta Ireland’s business model and the bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users_” [[191]](#_ftn191). In support of this consideration, the IE SA refers to the ”_first and sixth clauses_” of “_the specific contract entered into between Meta IE and Instagram users_”[[192]](#_ftn192). The IE SA considers that from the text of these “_clauses_” it is “_clear that the core of the service offered by Meta Ireland is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising_._205_” The IE SA considers that this position is supported by the fact that “_the Terms of Use describe the Instagram service as being ‘personalised’ and connects users with brands, including by means of providing ‘relevant’ advertising and content._” Based on this, the IE SA is of the view that “_It is clear that the Instagram service is advertised as offering a 'personalised' experience, including by way of the advertising it delivers to users[**[193]**](#_ftn193)_.” The IE SA considers that as the Instagram service is “_advertised_” in its Terms of Use “_as being predicated on personalised advertising (...) any reasonable user would expect and understand that this is part of the core bargain that is being struck (...)” but acknowledges that “users may prefer that the market offer alternative choices_[[194]](#_ftn194).”\n\n119.      On this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under EU law. It must be interpreted in a manner that fully reflects the objective pursued by an EU instrument, in this case, the GDPR[[195]](#_ftn195). Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision and the GDPR’s general objective of protecting the right to the protection of personal data or contradicts Article 8 of the Charter[[196]](#_ftn196). On the processing of data in the Facebook services, Advocate General Rantos supports a strict interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR among other legal bases, particularly to avoid any circumvention of the requirement for consent[[197]](#_ftn197). Given the similarities between the Facebook and Instagram services, as explained above in paragraph 97, and the fact that this case may concern the legal basis for processing of personal data for the Instagram service[[198]](#_ftn198).\n\n120.      As the IE SA states in its Draft Decision, “_Instagram is a global online social network service which allows registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video calls and video chats, and by sending images and video file_s_212_.” Meta IE promotes among its prospective and current users the perception that the main purpose of the Instagram service and for which it processes its users’ data is to enable them to share content and communicate with others. Meta IE presents its Instagram service on its “_About_” page of its website as a platform which “_give[s] people the power to build community and bring[s] the world closer together[**[199]**](#_ftn199)_.” At the beginning of its Terms of Use, Meta IE presents its mission for the Instagram service as “_To bring you closer to the people and things you love_[[200]](#_ftn200).” The description of the aspects of the service includes “_Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate_.”\n\n121.      The fact that the Terms of Use do not provide for any contractual obligation binding Meta IE to offer personalised advertising to the Instagram users and any contractual penalty if Meta IE fails to do so shows that, at least from the perspective of the Instagram user, this processing is not necessary to perform the contract[[201]](#_ftn201). Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation between\n\nMeta IE and the specific advertisers that pay for Meta IE’s targeted display of their advertisements in the Instagram service to Instagram users, but it is not presented as an obligation towards the Instagram users. \n\n122.      Nor does Meta IE’s business model of offering services, at no monetary cost for the user to generate income by behavioural advertisement to support its Instagram service make this processing necessary to perform the contract. Under the principle of lawfulness of the GDPR and its Article 6, it is the business model which must adapt itself and comply with the requirements that the GDPR sets out in general and for each of the legal bases and not the reverse. As the Advocate General Rantos stressed recently in his opinion on Meta IE’s processing in Facebook, based on Article 5(2) GDPR, it is the controller (Meta IE) in this case who is responsible for demonstrating that the personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR216. \n\n123.      As the EDPB provided in its guidance, “_Assessing what is ‘necessary’ involves a combined, fact-based assessment of the processing ‘for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared to other options for achieving the same goal’. If there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not ‘necessary’. Article 6(1)(b) will not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service or for taking relevant pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes._ 217”\n\n124.      On the question of whether here there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives to behavioural advertising that make this processing not “_necessary_”218, the EDPB considers that there are. The AT and SE SAs mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, which do not involve intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users219. In his recent opinion on Facebook, Advocate General Rantos also refers to the Austrian Government’s “_pertinent_” observation that in the past, Meta IE allowed Facebook users to choose between a chronological presentation and a personalised presentation of newsfeed content, which, in his view, proves that an alternative method is possible220. By considering the existence of alternative practices to behavioural advertising that are more respectful of the Instagram users’ right to data protection, the EDPB, as the Advocate General did in relation to Facebook users, aims to assess if this processing is objectively\n\nsection which is headed with _“Your Commitments”_. While Instagram itself only _“offers”_ various services, it makes clear that the Instagram Terms of Use unilaterally impose duties and obligations on the user. Otherwise, the user may face suspension or termination of their account, as described under “_Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account_” of the Instagram Terms of Use. No (contractual) sanctions appear to apply in the event that Meta IE fails to provide or poorly performs one or more of these services.\n\n216  C-252/21 Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf request, Opinion of the Advocate General on 20 September 2022, ECLI:EU:C:2022:704, paragraph 52.\n\n217  EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, paragraph 25.\n\n218  In _Schecke_, the CJEU held that, when examining the necessity of processing personal data, the legislature needed to take into account alternative, less intrusive measures. Judgement of the Court of Justice of 9 November 2010, Volker und Markus Schecke GbR, C-92/09 and C 93/09, ECLI:EU:C:2010:662, (hereinafter ‘Case C-92/09 and C 93/09 Schecke’), paragraph 52. This was repeated by the CJEU in the Rīgas case where it held that _“As regards the condition relating to the necessity of processing personal data, it should be borne in mind that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary”_. Judgement of the Court of Justice of 4 May 2017, Valsts policijas Rīgas reģiona pārvaldes Kārtības policijas pārvalde v Rīgas pašvaldības SIA ‘Rīgas satiksme’, C 13/16, ECLI:EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 30..\n\n219  AT SA Objection, p.5; SE SA Objection, p.3. \n\n220  C-252/21 Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf request, Opinion of the Advocate General on 20 September 2022, ECLI:EU:C:2022:704, footnote 80.\n\nnecessary to deliver the service offered, as perceived by the Instagram user whose personal data is processed, and not to dictate the nature of Meta IE’s service or impose specific business models on controllers, as Meta IE and the IE SA respectively argue[[202]](#_ftn202). The EDPB considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes[[203]](#_ftn203). \n\n125.      The EDPB considers that the absolute right available to data subjects, under Article 21(2)(3) GDPR to object to the processing of their data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes further supports its consideration that, as a general rule, the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary to perform a contract. The processing cannot be necessary to perform a contract if a data subject has the possibility to opt out from it at any time, and without providing any reason.\n\n126.      The EDPB finds that a reasonable user cannot expect that their personal data is being processed for behavioural advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to this processing in its Instagram Terms of Use (which Meta IE and the IE SA consider as constituting the entirety of the contract), or because of the _“wider circumstances”_ or _“recognised public awareness of this form of processing”_ derived from its _“widespread prevalence of OBA processing”_ to which the IE SA refers223. Behavioural advertising, as briefly described in paragraph 98 above, is a set of processing operations of personal data of great technical complexity, which has a particularly massive and intrusive nature. In view of the characteristics of behavioural advertising, coupled with the very brief and insufficient information that Meta provides about it in the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy (a separate document that the IE SA and Meta IE do not even consider part of the contractual obligations), the EDPB finds it  extremely difficult to argue that an average user can fully grasp it, be aware of its consequences and impact on their rights to privacy and data protection, and reasonably expect it solely based on the Instagram Terms of Use. The EDPB recalls its Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in which it argues that the expectations of the average data subject need to be consider in light, not only of the terms of service but also the way this service is promoted to users[[204]](#_ftn204). Advocate General Rantos expresses similar doubts where he says in relation to Facebook behavioural advertising practices _“I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for”[**[205]**](#_ftn205)_ and adds in a footnote that he does not “_believe that the collection and use of personal data outside Facebook are necessary for the provision of the services offered as part of the Facebook profile”[**[206]**](#_ftn206)._\n\n127.      The EDPB notes that the mission of the Instagram service, as expressed in its Terms of Use, is formulated in a vague and broad manner (“_To bring you closer to the people and things you love._”) When using the Instagram service, a user is primarily confronted with the possibility of viewing photographs and videos by people or organisations that they follow, as well as sharing such content with their followers. This is acknowledged by the IE SA which provides the following description of the Instagram service in its Draft Decision: “_Instagram is a global online social network service which allows registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video calls and video chats, and by sending images and video files[**[207]**](#_ftn207)_.”\n\n128.      Based on the considerations above, the EDPB considers that the main purpose for which users use Instagram and accept its Terms of Use is to share content and communicate with others, not to receive personalised advertisements. \n\n129.      Meta IE infringed its transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR by not clearly informing the complainant and other users of the Instagram Service specific processing operations, the personal data processed in them, the specific purposes they serve, and the legal basis on which each of the processing operations relies, as the IE SA concludes in its Draft Decision[[208]](#_ftn208)[[209]](#_ftn209). The EDPB considers that this fundamental failure of Meta IE to comply with its transparency obligations contradicts the IE SA’s finding that Instagram users could reasonably expect online behavioural advertising as being necessary for the performance of their contract (as described in the Instagram Terms of Use) with Meta IE229.  \n\n130.      The EDPB recalls that “_controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis is_” and that this is “_particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects_”, because _“[d]epending on the circumstances, data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR when signing a contract or accepting terms of service_”[[210]](#_ftn210). Article 6(1)(b) GDPR requires the existence, validity of a contract, and the processing being necessary to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the Parties (in this case the data subject) is not provided with sufficient information to know that they are signing a contract, the processing of personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes and on which legal basis, and how this processing is necessary to perform the services delivered. These transparency requirements are not only an additional and separate obligation, as the IE SA seems to imply, but also an indispensable and constitutive part of the legal basis231.\n\n131.      The risks to the rights of data subjects derived from this asymmetry of information and an inappropriate reliance on this legal basis are higher in situations such as in the present case, in which the Complainant and other Instagram users face a “_take it or leave it”_ situation resulting from the standard contract pre-formulated by Meta IE and the lack of few alternative services in the market. The EU legislator has regularly identified and aimed to address with multiple legal instruments these risks and the imbalance between the parties to consumer contracts. For example, Directive 93/13/EEC\n\non unfair terms in consumer contracts[[211]](#_ftn211) mandates, as the transparency obligations under the GDPR, the use of plain, intelligible language in the terms of the contracts offered to consumers[[212]](#_ftn212). This Directive even provides that where there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail[[213]](#_ftn213). Processing of personal data that is based on what is deemed to be an unfair term under this Directive will generally not be consistent with the requirement under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that the processing is lawful and fair[[214]](#_ftn214).\n\n132.      Advocate General Rantos concludes in reference to Meta IE that the fact that an undertaking providing a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social network for private users “_does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it[**[215]**](#_ftn215).”_ In line with the logic of this argument, the EDPB considers that the dominant position of Meta IE also plays an important role in the assessment of Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for its Instagram service and its risks to data subjects, especially considering how deficiently Meta IE informs the Instagram users of the data it strictly needs to process to deliver the service.\n\n133.      Given that the main purpose for which a user uses Instagram service is to share and receive content, and communicate with others237, and that Meta IE conditions their use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the behavioural advertising they include, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue[[216]](#_ftn216). The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and 7 and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.\n\n134.      The EDPB agrees with the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs that there is a risk that the Draft Decision’s failure to establish Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation of it, nullifies this provision and makes lawful theoretically any collection and reuse of personal data in connection with the performance of a contract with a data subject[[217]](#_ftn217). Meta IE currently leaves the complainant and other users of the Instagram service with a single choice. They may either contract away their right to freely determine the processing of their personal data and submit to its processing for the obscure, and intrusive purpose of behavioural advertising, which they can neither expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information Meta IE provides to them. Or, they may decline accepting Instagram Terms of Use and thus be excluded from a service that enables them to communicate, share content with and receive content from millions of users and for which there are currently few realistic alternatives. This exclusion would thus also adversely affect their freedom of expression and information. \n\n135.      This precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There would be the risk that some controllers argue some connection between the processing of the personal data of their consumers and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as possible and advance their economic interests at the expense of the safeguards for data subjects. Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis, instead of others such as consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) and legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). As a result, owing to the number of users of the Instagram service, the market power, and influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive business model, the risks derived from the current findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the Complainant and the millions of users of Instagram service in the EEA and affect the protection of the hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR[[218]](#_ftn218).  \n\n136.      The EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs 241 to Finding 2 of the Draft Decision in that the **behavioural advertising performed by Meta IE in the context of the Instagram service is objectively** **not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s alleged contract with data users for the Instagram service and is not an essential or core element of it**. \n\n137.      In conclusion, the EDPB decides that the Meta IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the complainant’s personal data in the context of Instagram Terms of Use and therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data for the purposes of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has not relied on any other legal basis to process personal data in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use for the purposes of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has consequently infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing personal data. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering\n\nof the Instagram Terms of Use and to include an infringement of Article 6 (1) GDPR based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified. \n\n# 5 ON WHETHER THE LSA’S DRAFT DECISION INCLUDES ENOUGH ANALYSIS AND EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE THAT META IE IS NOT OBLIGED TO RELY ON CONSENT TO PROCESS THE COMPLAINANT’S PERSONAL DATA\n\n## 5.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n138.      The IE SA concludes as a matter of fact, in its Draft Decision that Meta IE did not rely, and did not seek to rely, on the complainant’s consent to process personal data in connection with the Terms of Use[[219]](#_ftn219) and is not legally obliged to rely on consent to do so[[220]](#_ftn220). \n\n139.      The IE SA accepts that Meta IE never sought to obtain consent from users through the clicking of the “_Agree to Terms_” button, based also on Meta IE’s confirmation thereto[[221]](#_ftn221). \n\n140.      The IE SA distinguishes between agreeing to a contract (which may involve the processing of data) and providing consent to personal data processing specifically for the purposes of legitimising that personal data processing under the GDPR[[222]](#_ftn222). The IE SA observes that, as noted by the EDPB, these are entirely different concepts which “_have different requirements and legal consequences_”246.\n\n141.      The IE SA also emphasises that there is no hierarchy between the legal basis that controllers may use to process personal data under the GDPR[[223]](#_ftn223). The IE SA further argues that neither Article 6(1) GDPR nor any other provision in the GDPR require that the processing of data in particular contexts must necessarily be based on consent[[224]](#_ftn224). The IE SA argues the GDPR does not provide that the specific nature and content of a contract, freely entered into by two parties, requires a higher category or “_default_” legal basis. The IE SA includes reference to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR which assert that where data processing is necessary to perform a contract, consent is not an appropriate lawful basis on which to rely249. \n\n142.      The IE SA considers Article 7 GDPR and its conditions do not in and of themselves indicate the legal basis on which a controller should rely on in a particular context. The IE SA contends that these conditions would only be relevant where the controller relies upon consent as the legal basis for its processing, which it views as not being the case for the processing of data by Meta IE in question[[225]](#_ftn225).\n\n## 5.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs\n\n143.      The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs object to the assessment in the Draft Decision on consent, leading to Finding 1 of the IE SA[[226]](#_ftn226). These SAs put forward several factual and legal arguments for the changes they propose to the Draft Decision. \n\n144.      The SE SA holds that if the EDPB were to find that the processing can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the investigation needs to encompass whether special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) GDPR are processed, since the performance of a contract is not an exemption pursuant to Article 9(2) GDPR. Since the SE SA presents its objection as being contingent on whether the EDPB finds that the data processing in Instagram, based on its Terms of Use, can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[227]](#_ftn227) and the EDPB finds that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (see above in Section 4.4.2), the SE SA objection is no longer applicable.  \n\n#### _Arguments on the finding of the LSA that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent_\n\n145.      The AT, DE and NL SAs consider that the IE SA has not included enough analysis, evidence and research in the Draft Decision to conclude that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process the complainants’ data[[228]](#_ftn228). \n\n146.      The AT SA points out that the IE SA limits its facts and its legal assessment to the general question whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be used as legal basis, specifically for behavioural advertising. The Draft Decision does not clarify which data categories are being used for behavioural advertising and where Meta IE relies on Articles 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b) GDPR for behavioural advertising. Also unaddressed is, if and to which extent Meta IE relies on Article 9(2)(a) GDPR for behavioural advertising as far as sensitive data are concerned and whether Meta IE respected the GDPR conditions (for example, Article 7 GDPR) when obtaining the consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. The AT SA argues that the Draft Decision did not address the part of the complaint on the differences between “_consent_” and “_contractual performance_” and regarding Article 9 GDPR[[229]](#_ftn229). \n\n147.      Even though the DE SAs share the IE SA’s finding that Meta IE did not rely on consent for the processing of data as described in the Instagram Terms of Use, the DE SAs objects against the IE SA’s assessment that in the specific case at issue Meta IE was not legally obliged to obtain consent from the Complainant[[230]](#_ftn230). The DE SAs further add, also in relation to the potential use of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis, that further investigations on the specific processing activities, purposes and their risks for rights and freedoms of the Complainant would be necessary to conclude an assessment on the applicable legal basis[[231]](#_ftn231). \n\n148.      The NL SA notes its view that there is lack of any substantive investigation into what kind of personal data is being processed besides relying on information submitted by the controller[[232]](#_ftn232). The NL SA considers that there are clear indications that consent is legally required for (parts of) the processing operations of the controller, and that the IE SA could thus draw a different conclusion on the basis of further inquiries and analysis[[233]](#_ftn233). The NL SA considers that the Draft Decision should be amended if a further inquiry by the IE SA establishes that the reliance on consent as a legal ground is mandatory[[234]](#_ftn234).\n\n149.      In addition, the DE and FR SAs consider that even if Meta IE had relied on consent, it would not have met the requirements of Article 7(1) GDPR as being “_freely given_”, as it is conditional on the use of their services as a whole (“_take it or leave it_”). Nor would consent meet the requirements of Article 7(2) GDPR since, as the IE SA finds, information on the processing of data as described in the Terms of Use, is not provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language[[235]](#_ftn235).  \n\n#### _Arguments on the possible breach of the obligation to rely on consent to process special categories of_ _personal data (Article 9 GDPR)_\n\n150.      The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs  consider that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of Instagram Terms of Use[[236]](#_ftn236). The DE SAs conclude that Meta IE processes the complainant’s special categories of data in breach of Article 9 (1) GDPR[[237]](#_ftn237). The AT, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs take the view that the IE SA should broaden the scope of its investigation and examine whether the conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data have been met by Meta IE[[238]](#_ftn238).\n\n151.      The AT, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs consider that the factual background of the Draft Decision misses facts on whether Meta IE relies on Article 9(1)(a) GDPR to process special categories of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising and whether Meta IE respects the requirements of the GDPR, such as those of Article 7, in obtaining consent to that end[[239]](#_ftn239).\n\n152.      The FR and NL SAs argue that the data that Meta IE processes may include special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR[[240]](#_ftn240). The DE SAs contend that nothing indicates that Meta IE excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes266. \n\n153.      The FR SA notes that Instagram users can provide various sensitive data about themselves, including their sexual orientation, religious views and political opinions in the description of their profile. The FR SA considers that the IE SA cannot simply state that it has no evidence that Meta IE processes such data in the context of the Instagram service. In order to deal with the complaint, the FR SA asks for further investigation, in particular it asks the LSA to examine whether sensitive data are processed by the controller and, if so, whether one of the conditions of Article 9(2) GDPR is met in this case[[241]](#_ftn241). \n\n154.      The NL SA argues that there is strong indication that some data processed in the context of the Instagram service actually belongs to a special category of data considering “_photographs and other images that are, or were, potentially processed with use of facial recognition technology and other artificial intelligence technologies in the context of Facebook services_”[[242]](#_ftn242). The NL SA highlights that according to the CJEU ruling in case C-136/17 the mere indexing of certain data could already suffice to conclude that Article 9 GDPR applies[[243]](#_ftn243). \n\n155.      The DE and NL SAs recall that only consent may be used in this context among the exceptions that Article 9 (2) GDPR lays down to the general prohibition of processing special categories of data[[244]](#_ftn244). The FI SA recalls that the performance of a contract is not an exception pursuant to Article 9(2) GDPR[[245]](#_ftn245).  \n\n#### _Arguments on other types of data requiring consent_\n\n156. The NL SA identifies as another indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation to seek consent the fact that the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has been collected through cookies for online advertising purposes and of location data[[246]](#_ftn246). \n\n#### _Risks_\n\n157.      On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs consider that, as the subject of the complaint was the processing as described in the Instagram Terms of Use there is also a significant risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Instagram users in the European Union that their personal data, including data of special categories are processed without any legal basis[[247]](#_ftn247). The AT SA also considers that the compliance of Meta IE with the GDPR rules on the processing of special categories of data goes beyond the case at stake and affects hundreds of millions of data subjects within the EEA, as Meta IE is the provider of the biggest media network in the world[[248]](#_ftn248).\n\n158.      The AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs argue that the IE SA’s conclusion that consent is not required affects the rights of data subjects and their control over their personal data[[249]](#_ftn249). \n\n159.      The AT SA argues that the first risk is that the data subject’s right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because the IE SA did not handle the complaint in its entire scope, including sensitive data pursuant to Article 9 GPDR. The AT\n\nSA argues that this is not in line with the CJEU ruling in case C-311/18, which provides that the supervisory authority must handle complaints with all due diligence[[250]](#_ftn250). \n\n160.      The FR SA argues that the Draft Decision poses a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, according to Article 4(24) GDPR, insofar as the legal basis of contractual performance to process the personal data of Instagram users to send them targeted advertising does not allow the European users to have control over the fate of their data[[251]](#_ftn251). The FR SA also notes that since the Draft Decision will be taken at the end of a cooperation procedure and made public, it could be interpreted as reflecting the common position of the European supervisory authorities on this issue, and setting a precedent for accepting that a company may use the legal basis of the contract to process its users’ data for targeted advertising purposes when such processing is particularly massive and intrusive[[252]](#_ftn252). \n\n161.      The NL SA specifies the protections from which the data subjects would be deprived due to the IE SA’s conclusion that consent is not required, such as the right to data portability (Article 20(1) GDPR); the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right to be forgotten[[253]](#_ftn253). \n\n162.      The AT, DE, FI and NL SAs note as an additional risk that sensitive personal data falling within the scope of Article 9 GDPR is processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9(2) GDPR[[254]](#_ftn254). \n\n163.      The FI SA highlights that the will of the legislator has been to protect the Article 9 GDPR special category data with a duty of care and if there is any reasonable doubt that Meta IE has no legal basis for processing operations of such sensitive data of the Instagram users, the said claim needs to be properly investigated or otherwise the lack of investigation would negatively affect hundreds of millions of Instagram users within the EEA and undermine their right to privacy and data protection281.\n\n164.      The NL SA underlines the risk that allowing the bypassing of legal provisions requiring consent to process data creates legal uncertainty that hampers the free flow of personal data within the EU[[255]](#_ftn255).\n\n165.      The NL SA also argues that not assessing the processing in a sufficiently thorough manner could create a precedent for controllers to exclude from their privacy policies or terms of service processing operations that must be based on consent. This would risk leaving data subjects with a reduced degree of transparency283.  \n\n## 5.3 Position of the LSA on the objections\n\n166.      The IE SA considers the objections not reasoned and does not follow them[[256]](#_ftn256). \n\n167.      The IE SA argues that the scope of the inquiry is appropriate and relates to the issues raised in the complaint. It also argues that finding of additional infringements which have not been fully investigated or put to the controller would impose a risk of procedural unfairness by depriving the controller of its right to be heard in response to a particularised allegation of wrongdoing[[257]](#_ftn257).  \n\n168.      The IE SA notes that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry, taking into account the scope of the written complaint as lodged. The IE SA argues that it would not have been possible to assess each discrete processing operation by Meta IE, without first resolving the fundamental dispute between the parties on the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR. The IE SA considers that it would have been inappropriate and disproportionate for it to undertake an open-ended assessment of all of Meta IE’s processing operations related to the Instagram Terms of Use to handle the complaint[[258]](#_ftn258).  \n\n169.      The IE SA argues that its analysis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not preclude the possibility that certain discrete processing operations by Meta IE may fall outside the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA finds it reasonable and practical to set the scope of the inquiry, focusing on the principled issues of dispute, which it considers as not prejudicing the operation of more specific data protection rules[[259]](#_ftn259). \n\n170.      The IE SA considers that the reference to Article 9 GDPR processing by Meta IE is an element of what it views as the Complainant’s fundamental allegation, i.e. that the agreement to the Terms of Use was a form of GDPR consent to processing of personal data, including consent to the processing of special categories of data. The IE SA argues that since the scope of its inquiry addresses this issue, it is not necessary for it to also conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of Meta IE’s processing that may otherwise fall within the scope of Article 9 GDPR [[260]](#_ftn260).\n\n171.      The IE SA notes that under Irish national law, there would be a very significant risk of procedural unfairness to Meta IE if the IE SA assumed, without any further factual examination, that Meta IE unlawfully processes special categories of personal data[[261]](#_ftn261).\n\n172.      According to the IE SA, the CSAs objecting to the Draft Decision intend to maximise the complainant’s rights by requiring consent-based processing for certain processing operations and thus prioritising it over other legal basis. The IE SA considers that very extensive data protection rights also apply under the GDPR where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The IE SA contends that the variation in the extent of data subject rights and protections, depending on the applicable legal basis, is an inherent element of the legislative scheme of the GDPR. The IE SA considers that Article 6 GDPR does not provide that the “_appropriate_” data subject rights determine the legal basis for processing. The IE SA notes that separate to the user’s acceptance of the Terms of Use, Meta IE\n\nrelies on different “_acts_” of consent for specific aspects of the service, including personalised advertising based on users’ off-Instagram activities. In this regard, the IE SA states that the complaint in this case was about the agreement to the Terms of Use and the processing it entails once accepted[[262]](#_ftn262). \n\n173.      The IE SA argues that the objections are inconsistent with the principle of legal certainty, as cited in Recital 7 GDPR. The IE SA indicates that it is not satisfied that the GDPR requires the limitation of processing for the purposes of behavioural advertising to situations where processing is based on data subject consent[[263]](#_ftn263). The IE SA contends that interpretative approach of the CSAs raising objections would result in the arbitrary application of more restrictive data protection rules for reasons that are not found in the GDPR. The IE SA also states that this approach does not take due account of the extensive data protection rights which apply to all legal bases under the GDPR. The IE SA asserts that it is not open to the supervisory authorities to create additional binding limitations on the applicable legal basis for the processing of data for behavioural advertising. The IE SA states that it is the legislator, not the supervisory authorities, which has defined the conditions for lawful processing 292. \n\n## 5.4 Assessment of the EDPB\n\n### 5.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned\n\n174.      The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s primary arguments to the contrary in Section 4.4.1 above[[264]](#_ftn264).\n\n175.      The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs objections analysed in this section have a direct connection with the Draft Decision and refer to a specific part of the Draft Decision, i.e. Finding 1. The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs argue that the IE SA has not carried out enough investigation and legal analysis in the Draft Decision to conclude that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process the complainants’ data[[265]](#_ftn265)[[266]](#_ftn266)94. According to these CSAs, the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data in Instagram Terms of Use[[267]](#_ftn267). The NL SA argues that processing operations concerning location data and the use of tracking technologies on users devices should have investigated and assessed by the IE SA as well[[268]](#_ftn268). The AT, FI, FR and NL SAs consider that the IE SA should broaden the scope of its investigation and examine whether the conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data have been met by Meta IE in relation to the Instagram service[[269]](#_ftn269). The DE, FR and NL SAs argue that the data that Meta IE’s processes may include special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR [[270]](#_ftn270). They contend that nothing indicates that Meta IE excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes. The AT, DE, ES, FI and FR SAs highlight that the issue falls within the remit of the complaint since the complainant alleged a potential violation of Article 9 GDPR and should therefore be investigated and assessed by the LSA[[271]](#_ftn271). The AT, DE, ES, FI and FR SAs challenge the reasoning underling the conclusion reached by the LSA. This assessment could lead to a different conclusion insofar as the IE SA would fully cover the complaint and include facts and a legal assessment on the Instagram’s service processing operations to which Article 6(1)(a), Articles 7 and 9 GDPR may apply, which may reveal an infringement by Meta\n\nIE[[272]](#_ftn272). \n\n176.      Consequently, the EDPB finds that the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs objections relating to Finding 1, which states that Meta IE is not required to rely on consent to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use and its underlying reasoning, are **relevant**[[273]](#_ftn273).\n\n177.      The AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs objections are **reasoned** because they include clarifications and arguments on legal/factual mistakes in the LSA’s Draft Decision that require amending. The AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs consider that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing of **special categories of personal data** under Article 9 GDPR in the context of Instagram Terms of Use[[274]](#_ftn274).  In particular, the DE, FR and NL SAs argue that the data that Meta IE processes may include special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR and that nothing indicates that Meta IE excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes[[275]](#_ftn275). The AT, DE, ES, FR and NL SAs recall that only consent may be used in this context among the exceptions that Article 9 (2) GDPR lays down to the general prohibition of processing special categories of data[[276]](#_ftn276). The FI SA recalls that EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR state that the WP29 has observed that Article 9(2) GDPR does not recognise “_necessary for the performance of a contract_” as an exception to the general prohibition to process special categories of data[[277]](#_ftn277). The NL SA identifies as another indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation to seek consent the fact that the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has been collected through cookies for online advertising purposes and of location data[[278]](#_ftn278). The NL SA also argues that the IE SA should have investigated more into the safeguards that are implemented by the controller to address the specific interests of children[[279]](#_ftn279). Lastly, the NL SA states that the information shared by users on Instagram may contain personal data concerning the health of individual users and mentions the ruling of the CJEU in case C-136/17 stating that the mere indexing of certain data could already suffice to conclude that Article 9 of the GDPR applies[[280]](#_ftn280).\n\n178.      On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs explain that the IE SA’s Finding 1 providing that consent is not required puts at risk the rights of data subjects and their control over their personal data[[281]](#_ftn281). The AT SA mentions the risk that the data subject’s right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because the IE SA does not handle it in its entire scope, including special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR[[282]](#_ftn282). The FR SA argues that the Draft Decision could set a precedent for accepting the use of the contractual performance legal basis to process users’ data for targeted advertising purposes, which it views as particularly massive and intrusive[[283]](#_ftn283). The NL SA specifies that the data subjects could be deprived of the following protections derived from the use of consent: the right to data portability (Article 20(1) GDPR); the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right to be forgotten[[284]](#_ftn284). The AT, DE, FI and NL SAs also note as an additional risk that special categories of personal data falling within the scope of Article 9 GDPR are processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9 (2) GDPR[[285]](#_ftn285). The NL SA also underlines the data protection deficits that are foreseeable with a switch from consent to contract legal basis and the risk that this conclusion would create legal uncertainty that hampers the free flow of personal data within the EU[[286]](#_ftn286). The NL SA further adds the risk that the decision could create by setting a precedent for controllers to exclude from their privacy policies or terms of service processing operations based on consent, thus undermining the principle of transparency[[287]](#_ftn287). The ES SA does not describe any risk on this specific topic in their objection316.\n\n179.      On the basis of the above considerations, the EDPB finds that the objections raised by the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs concerning the conclusions in the Draft Decision about the fact that Meta IE is not obliged to rely on consent to process the complainant’s data, are **relevant and reasoned** objections under Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n180.      However, the part of the NL SA objection asking the IE SA to include in its Draft Decision the elements concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices under ePrivacy legislation falls outside the scope of the EDPB’s mandate[[288]](#_ftn288). \n\n181.      Finally, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the ES SA regarding the potential infringement of Article 9 GDPR is not sufficiently reasoned with reference to the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision at stake and, therefore, the objection of the ES SA does not meet the threshold provided for by Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n### 5.4.2 Assessment on the merits\n\n182.      In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR. \n\n183.      The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection[[289]](#_ftn289) require an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed on its Finding 1, which concludes that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use and (b) is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so. When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions.\n\n##### Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions\n\n184.      In its submissions, Meta IE supports the IE SA’s conclusion that Meta IE does not rely on consent for the purposes of behavioural advertising and is not required to rely on it[[290]](#_ftn290). \n\n185.      Meta IE states that it does not seek or rely on consent as its legal basis for purposes of processing personal data to provide behavioural advertising, except in limited circumstances where Meta IE separately obtains consent, yet not through users’ acceptance the Terms of Use[[291]](#_ftn291). Meta IE claims that it explains in its Data Policy to data subjects that Meta IE relies on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR “_[f]or using data that advertisers and other partners provide us about [users’] activity off of Meta Company Products, so we can personalise ads we show [them] on Meta Company Products and on websites, apps and devices that use our advertising services”_ and that it has a separate process for obtaining this consent in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Article 4(11) and Article 7 GDPR and which is “_entirely separate from any interaction by users with the Terms of Use or Data Policy, is not part of the Complaint and has not been examined”_ in the IE SA’s inquiry[[292]](#_ftn292). Meta IE submits that the Complaint is limited to the question of whether Meta IE seeks forced consent to data processing through acceptance of the Terms of Use. Meta IE then asserts that since it does not seek, obtain, or rely on consent as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process user data via acceptance of the Terms of Use, the inquiry should end there and all unrelated assertions in the objections should be disregarded[[293]](#_ftn293). \n\n186.      Meta IE alleges that some CSAs suggest that behavioural advertising must in all cases be based on consent, and in doing so, the CSAs suggest an approach that mandates Meta IE to rely on consent for “_its data processing for purposes of behavioural advertising (or any other purpose)_”[[294]](#_ftn294). Meta IE agrees with the IE SA’s assertion that any approach limiting the legal basis on which a controller could rely would not be consistent with the principle of legal certainty[[295]](#_ftn295). Meta IE considers that the GDPR was drafted in a way that protects data subjects while affording flexibility to controllers and that its application is highly dependent on facts and circumstances underlying the relevant processing and the nature of the service providers[[296]](#_ftn296). Meta IE contends that the GDPR contains no express references to behavioural advertising and establishes no specific limitations on the available legal basis for such processing; it is technology neutral and does not include specific derogations or rules for any one specific industry326.\n\n187.      With regard to the consideration that consent as a legal basis provides more extensive data protection rights, Meta IE argues that in defining the conditions for lawful processing, the EU legislature has ensured that appropriate data protection rights would be afforded to data subjects no matter what legal basis is relied on and extensive data protection rights apply to all legal bases[[297]](#_ftn297). Meta IE supports the IE SA’s view that Article 6(1) GDPR does not require legal bases to be determined by reference to the applicable data subject rights for each basis[[298]](#_ftn298).\n\n##### EDPB’s assessment on the merits\n\n188.      The EDPB notes that the IE SA’s Draft Decision submitted via the Article 60 GDPR procedure results from an inquiry that the IE SA conducted based on a complaint from a data subject and Instagram user[[299]](#_ftn299). The BE SA forwarded this complaint to the IE SA as LSA in the case, given Meta IE’s main establishment in Ireland. \n\n189.      In this complaint, the Complainant alleges that Meta IE violated Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 GDPR. The Complainant argues that it is unclear to what the data subject has consented when the data subject agreed to Instagram Terms of Use and Privacy Policy330. More specifically, the Complainant points out that it remains unclear which exact processing operations the controller chooses to base on each specific legal basis under Articles 6 and 9 GDPR[[300]](#_ftn300). The Complainant argues that the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy also include special categories of data under Article 9(1) GDPR because the data subject, as an Instagram user, has interacted with various groups and individuals, which would accordingly reveal the data subject’s political affiliation, sexual orientation, health condition, etc[[301]](#_ftn301). The Complainant claims that the controller also allows to target such information for advertisement[[302]](#_ftn302). The Complainant considers that it would be necessary for the SA to investigate the concrete subject of the alleged consent and the legal basis for all processing operations and to request the record of processing activities under Article 30(4) GDPR[[303]](#_ftn303).\n\n190.      Based on the scope of the IE SA’s investigation into this complaint, the EDPB considers that the IE SA decided to limit the scope of its Draft Decision to the following legal issues:\n\no   Issue 1 – Whether clicking on the “_Agree to Terms_” button constitutes or must be considered consent for the purposes of the GDPR and, if so, whether it is valid consent for the purposes of the GDPR.\n\no   Issue 2 – Whether Meta IE could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for processing of personal data in the context of Terms of Use and/or Data Policy. \n\no   Issue 3 – Whether Meta IE provided the requisite information on the legal basis for processing on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and whether it did so in a transparent manner. [[304]](#_ftn304)  \n\n191.      The IE SA argues that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry taking into account the scope of the written complaint as lodged[[305]](#_ftn305). The IE SA considers that it would not have been possible to undertake an assessment of each discrete processing operation by Meta IE without first resolving the fundamental dispute between the parties on the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR[[306]](#_ftn306). In relation to the processing of Article 9 GDPR categories of data, the IE SA considers that the inquiry has addressed the fundamental issue of principle on which the complaint depends, and this makes it unnecessary to conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of processing falling within the scope of this Article[[307]](#_ftn307). The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use and (b) is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so, based on the submissions of the Parties and Instagram Terms of Use[[308]](#_ftn308). The IE SA warns CSAs on the legal risks derived from asking through the objections to expand the material scope of the inquiry and thus cover infringements outside of the complaint and Draft Decision that the IE SA has not investigated (pursuant to its own decision to limit the scope of the inquiry) and put to Meta IE[[309]](#_ftn309).\n\n192.      The EDPB notes that the Complaint makes plain the confusion of the Instagram user over which of the user’s special categories of data are processed, for which purposes and on which basis. \n\n193.      The Instagram Terms of Use themselves note in general terms “_Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products_”[[310]](#_ftn310) (service which includes “_Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share_” and “_Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about_”[[311]](#_ftn311)). The Instagram Terms of Use include a reference to a separate document “_the Data Policy_”[[312]](#_ftn312), which lists under the heading “_Things you and others do and provide_”: “_Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events, about your religious views, political views, who you are ‘interested in’ or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) is subject to special protections under EU law_”[_**[313]**_](#_ftn313). The Data Policy describes the purposes for which these data are processed in very general terms such as “_Provide, personalize and improve our products_” and “_to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you_”[_**[314]**_](#_ftn314) with no specific reference to the specific processing operations and categories of data each purpose would cover. Meta IE thus seems to acknowledge in its Data Policy[[315]](#_ftn315) that it uses special categories of data for behavioural advertising purposes, without specifying the “_special protections under EU law_” that it would apply to such processing. Meta IE only includes a general reference to consent among other legal basis in the same page[[316]](#_ftn316), which includes a link to a separate facebook.com page mentioning the use of consent on data with special protection and referring to the Instagram Settings[[317]](#_ftn317).\n\n194.      The IE SA finds that the way in which Meta IE provides, in relation to processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is relied upon, this information and the lack of information on the specific processing operations, the data involved, their purposes and legal basis constitute an infringement of transparency obligations under the GDPR (Article 5(1)(a), Article 12 (1), and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR)[[318]](#_ftn318). The IE SA considers the complaint in this case to be limited to the Terms of Use and the processing it entails once accepted[[319]](#_ftn319). In these circumstances, the IE SA accepts at face value Meta IE’s submission on its reliance on different _“acts”_ of consent for discrete aspects of the service separately from the user’s acceptance of the Terms of Use351.  The IE SA does not engage into any further examination or verification on how consent is sought in the case of processing carried out to provide discrete aspects of the service.  The IE SA also does not examine or verify whether special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR are processed in the context of the Instagram service and, if so, whether they are subject to these _“acts”_ of consent and thus effectively treated outside the scope of the Terms of Use\n\nand the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on which the Terms of Use purportedly rely, or whether some special categories of personal data, as defined by the GDPR and EU case-law[[320]](#_ftn320), are treated under the Instagram Terms of Use. \n\n195.      The CJEU asserted recently that the purpose of Article 9(1) GDPR is to ensure an enhanced protection of data subjects for processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter[[321]](#_ftn321). The CJEU adopts a wide interpretation of the terms _“special categories of personal data”_ and _“sensitive data”_ that includes data liable indirectly to reveal sensitive information concerning a natural person[[322]](#_ftn322). Advocate General Rantos reiterates the importance for the protection of data subjects of Article 9 GDPR and applies the same interpretation to the data processing in social network services for behavioural advertising by stating that _“the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data may include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network consisting in the collection of a user’s data when he or she visits other websites or apps or enters such data into them, the linking of such data to the user account on the social network and the use of such data, provided that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, make it possible to profile users on the basis of the categories that emerge from the listing in that provision of types of sensitive personal data”[**[323]**](#_ftn323)._ \n\n196.      Therefore, the GDPR and the case-law pay especial attention to the processing or potential processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR to ensure the protection of the data subjects. In this connection, the Complainant alleges in the Complaint, among others, a violation of Article 9 GDPR and expressly requests the IE SA to investigate Meta IE’s processing operations in the context of the Instagram service covered by this Article[[324]](#_ftn324). In a subsequent submission on the Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant criticises the scope that the IE SA decided to give to the Complaint and its lack of investigation of Meta IE’s processing activities and alleges that the IE SA failed to give due consideration to processing under Article 9 GDPR and other cases in which it relies on consent[[325]](#_ftn325).  \n\n197.      In the present case, the IE SA limited its facts and legal assessment in the Draft Decision to the general question of whether Meta IE has (a) sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use and (b) if it is legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so. The IE SA categorically concludes on these questions. At the same time, the IE SA acknowledges a serious lack of transparency by Meta IE, as regards the information provided concerning the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and does not clarify which data categories are being processed for behavioural advertising, if Meta IE processes special categories of data, and if it does, if\n\nMeta IE complies with the conditions of Article 9 GDPR and others relevant to the application of this provision (for example, Articles 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR).\n\n198.      By deciding not to investigate, further to the Complaint, the processing of special categories of personal data in the context of the Instagram service, the IE SA leaves unaddressed the risks this processing poses for the Complainant and for Instagram users. First, there is the risk that the Complainant’s special categories of personal data are processed within the Instagram service to build intimate profiles of them for behavioural advertising purposes without a legal basis and in a manner not compliant with the GDPR and the strict requirements of its Article 9(2) GDPR and other GDPR provisions relevant thereto. Second, there is also the risk that Meta IE does not consider as special categories of personal data (in line with the GDPR and the CJEU case-law[[326]](#_ftn326)) certain categories of personal data it processes and consequently, that Meta IE does not treat them accordingly. Third, the Complainant and other Instagram users whose special categories of are processed may be deprived of certain special protections derived from the use of consent, such as the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right to be forgotten[[327]](#_ftn327). Fourth, given the great size and dominant market share of Meta IE in the social media market, leaving unaddressed its current ambiguity in the processing of special categories of personal data, and its limited transparency vis-à-vis Instagram users, may set a precedent for controllers to operate in the same manner and create legal uncertainty hampering the free flow of personal data within the EU. \n\n199.      The EDPB further considers, also in view of these risks to the Complainant and to other Instagram users, that the IE SA did not handle the Complaint with all due diligence[[328]](#_ftn328). The EDPB sees the lack of any further investigation into the processing of special categories of personal data as an omission, and in the present case finds it relevant that the Complainant alleged infringements of Article 9 GDPR in the Complaint361. The EDPB contends that in the present case, the IE SA should have verified on the basis of the contract and the data processing actually carried out on which legal bases each data processing operation at issue relies.\n\n200.      The EDPB also highlights that by limiting excessively the scope of its inquiry despite the scope of the complaint in this cross-border case and systematically considering all the objections raised by CSAs not relevant and/or reasoned and thus denying their formal admissibility, the IE SA as LSA in this case, constrains the capacity of CSAs to act and tackle the risks to data subjects in sincere and effective cooperation. As ruled by the CJEU, the LSA must exercise its competence within a framework of close cooperation with other supervisory authorities concerned and cannot “_eschew essential dialogue with_\n\n_and sincere and effective cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned_”[[329]](#_ftn329). The limited scope the IE SA gave to the inquiry and its consideration of all the objections made as inadmissible for being not relevant or reasoned also impairs the EDPB’s capacity to conclude on the matter pursuant to Article 65 GDPR and thus ensure a consistent application of EU data protection law, especially considering that the complaint was introduced more than four years ago. \n\n201.      As a result of the limited scope of the inquiry and the fact that the IE SA did not verify and assess in the Draft Decision Meta IE’s processing of special categories of personal data in its Instagram service, the EDPB does not have sufficient factual evidence on Meta IE’s processing operations to enable it to make a finding on any possible infringement by Meta IE of its obligations under Article 9 GDPR and other GDPR provisions relevant thereto. \n\n202.      In conclusion, the EDPB decides that the IE SA cannot categorically conclude at this stage through its Finding 1 that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to carry out the personal data processing activities involved in the delivery of the Instagram Service, including behavioural advertising as set out in the Instagram Terms of Use without further investigating its processing operations, the categories of data processed (including to identify special categories of personal data that may be processed), and the purposes they serve. \n\n203.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its Instagram service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and complies with the relevant obligations under the GDPR, to the extent that this new investigation complements the findings made in the IE SA’s Final Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding Decision, and based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft dDecision in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR [[330]](#_ftn330). \n\n# 6 ON THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS \n\n## 6.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n204. The IE SA in its Draft Decision addresses the Complainant’s allegations that the unclear and misleading nature of the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, together with the mode of acceptance of the Terms of Use, have made Instagram users believe that all processing operations were based on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and thus constituted a breach of the Meta IE’s transparency obligations under Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR[[331]](#_ftn331). The IE SA analyses the submissions provided by the Meta IE and, noting the Complaint’s focus on the alleged “_forced consent_”[[332]](#_ftn332), concludes that Meta IE has breached Article 5(1)(a), Article 13(1)(c) and Article 12(1) GDPR due to the lack of transparency in relation to the processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has been relied on[[333]](#_ftn333). The IE SA explains that, while an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR does not necessarily or automatically flow from findings of infringement under Articles 12 and/or 13 GDPR, there is an important link between these provisions[[334]](#_ftn334). Nevertheless, the IE SA takes the view that “_[t]he factual question of whether the data subject was misled as to the legal basis is therefore part of the broader question as to whether there was compliance with transparency requirements and should not be considered in isolation of this broader issue”_368. The IE SA points out that Article 5(1)(a) GDPR links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of the controller[[335]](#_ftn335) and concludes on the breach of this provision in relation to the infringement of the transparency obligations[[336]](#_ftn336).\n\n## 6.2 Summary of the objection raised by the CSA\n\n205.      The IT SA objects to the scope of Finding 3 of the Draft Decision and to the assessment leading up to it. The IT SA agrees to a large extent with the Draft Decision’s Finding 3 on the infringement of Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency[[337]](#_ftn337). However, the IT SA argues that Meta IE has also failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, which, in the view of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically to transparency[[338]](#_ftn338). \n\n206.      According to the IT SA, the relationship between Meta IE and Instagram users is markedly and significantly unbalanced[[339]](#_ftn339) and an infringement of the fairness principle resulted, first of all, from the misrepresentation of the legal basis for processing by the controller[[340]](#_ftn340), considering that “_Meta presented its service to users in a misleading manner_” and “_without taking due account of users’ right to the protection of their personal data_”[[341]](#_ftn341).  The IT SA argues that “_the controller leaves its users in the dark as they are expected to tell or actually ‘figure out’, from time to time, the possible connections between purpose sought, applicable legal basis and relevant processing activities_”376.  \n\n207.      Secondly, such infringement also stems from the “_high-level and all-encompassing reference to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as relied upon to enable the massive collection of personal data [...] and their reuse for multifarious, distinct purposes_”, considering the “_pervasive as well as prolonged analysis of [the users’] online behaviour_” amounting to a disproportionate interference with their private lives compared to the pursuit of freedom of enterprise[[342]](#_ftn342). \n\n208.      The IT SA thus considers that the IE SA should have found an infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to the infringement of the transparency obligations derived\n\nfrom this provision, without any need for supplementary investigations[[343]](#_ftn343). According to the IT SA, should the objection be followed, it would also impact the exercise of by corrective powers by the IE SA, i.e. the measures to be imposed on the controller in order to bring the processing into conformity with the GDPR[[344]](#_ftn344).\n\n## 6.3 Position of the LSA on the objection\n\n209.      The IE SA does not consider the IT SA objection to be relevant and reasoned and does not follow it[[345]](#_ftn345). The IE SA examines it together with the other objections relating to the scope and conduct of the inquiry and contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to the parties would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry[[346]](#_ftn346). \n\n210.      The IE SA highlights the legal consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning infringements outside of the Complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would succeed in arguing before the Irish Courts that it has been denied an opportunity to be heard on additional and extraneous findings that are adverse to it[[347]](#_ftn347). The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE was never invited to be heard in response to an allegation that it had infringed the fairness principle set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The IE SA notes, in this regard, that a respondent has the right to be heard in response to the particulars of the case being made against it and that this is a core element of a fair procedure pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view that expanding the material scope of the inquiry is neither necessary, nor could be reconciled with the controller’s right to a fair procedure[[348]](#_ftn348).\n\n## 6.4 Analysis of the EDPB\n\n### 6.4.1 Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned\n\n211.      The IT SA objection concerns “_whether there is an infringement of the GDPR_”[[349]](#_ftn349). \n\n212.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the objections categorised by the IE SA as relating to the scope and conduct of the inquiry, among which the IT SA objection regarding the infringement of the fairness principle, are “_irrelevant to the resolution of this Inquiry_” and, if accepted, would seriously infringe Meta IE’s procedural rights under both Irish and EU law[[350]](#_ftn350). According to Meta IE, “_the EDPB cannot expand the scope of the Inquiry in the manner suggested by the CSAs through Objections that are not relevant to the substance of the Complaint_” and in relation to this Meta IE refers to the EDPB Binding Decision 2/2022[[351]](#_ftn351). \n\n213.      Meta IE further contends that the IT SA objection is not reasoned as it provides broad and unsubstantiated allegations without presenting facts or evidence in this regard[[352]](#_ftn352) and fails to address the significance of the risk to fundamental rights and freedoms posed by the Draft Decision[[353]](#_ftn353).\n\n214.      As it was previously explained, the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree with the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection[[354]](#_ftn354).The EDPB recalls that an objection could go as far as identifying gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation by the LSA, for example in situations where the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised by the complainant[[355]](#_ftn355). In this regard, the EDPB observes that, in their complaint, the Complainant alleges that the information provided in Meta IE’s Privacy Policy “_is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c) GDPR_”[[356]](#_ftn356). In addition, the Complainant alleges that “_Asking for consent to a processing operation, when the controller relies in fact on another legal basis is fundamentally unfair, misleading and nontransparent within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR_”[[357]](#_ftn357). Therefore, the EDPB disagrees with the IE SA’s finding that assessing Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness would amount addressing matters “_which fall outside of the scope of the underlying complaint_”[[358]](#_ftn358).\n\n215.      The EDPB notes that the IT SA agrees with the IE SA’s finding with regard to the infringement of the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR[[359]](#_ftn359)[[360]](#_ftn360). As this finding is not subject to a dispute, the EDPB will not examine this matter. \n\n216.      After analysing the IT SA objection, the EDPB finds that the objection is **relevant**, as it refers to a specific part of the Draft Decision (Finding 3395), and if followed would lead to the conclusion that there is an infringement of the general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to the breach of the separate requirements relating to transparency under this provision396. The objection, if followed, would also entail the exercise of corrective powers, i.e. the measures to be imposed on the controller in order to bring the processing into conformity with the GDPR [[361]](#_ftn361).\n\n217.      The IT SA objection is also **reasoned** because it includes several specific legal and factual arguments in support of finding an additional infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR[[362]](#_ftn362). For example, the IT SA explains that “[_t]ransparency and fairness are two separate notions_” and that “_transparency relates to clarity of the information provided to users via the ToS and the privacy policy_”, while “_fairness relates to how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with its social networking service_”[[363]](#_ftn363). The IT SA contends that the “_overall relationship between Meta and Instagram users is markedly as well as significantly unbalanced_”[[364]](#_ftn364). According to the IT SA, the first way in which Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness is by misrepresenting the legal basis for processing in order to pursue its business model “_without taking due account of users’ right to the protection of personal data_” and leaving “_its users in the dark_” [[365]](#_ftn365). Further, in the IT SA’s view, Meta IE has breached the fairness principle, by justifying via the broad reference to the legal basis of performance of contract a massive collection of personal data and their reuse for a wide range of purposes, disproportionately interfering with users’ private life[[366]](#_ftn366). \n\n218.      The IT SA objection also identifies the risks posed by the absence in the Draft Decision of a finding on the infringement of the fairness principle, namely setting a dangerous precedent for future decisions concerning other digital platform operators - more generally, other controllers belonging to the same business sector - and markedly weakening the safeguards that must be provided through the effective implementation of the data protection framework on account of the comprehensive disregard of the fairness of the processing principle403.\n\n219.      Therefore, the EDPB considers that the IT SA objection is **relevant and reasoned** (cf. Article 4(24) GDPR).\n\n### 6.4.2 Assessment on the merits\n\n220.      In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.\n\n221.      The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it contains no finding of infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objection and its submissions.\n\n222.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection lacks merit as it goes beyond the scope of the inquiry[[367]](#_ftn367). The EDPB also notes that Meta IE links the issue of the potential infringement of the principle of fairness, raised in the IT SA objection, with the question of the competence of CSAs or the EDPB to assess the validity of contracts in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and, when responding to the merits of the IT SA objection, Meta IE refers to its submissions on application of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR with respect to standard form contracts[[368]](#_ftn368). While taking note of Meta IE’s view on this matter, the EDPB considers the question of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be distinct from the question of the choice of the appropriate legal basis (although a connected one, as explained below) and proceeds with its respective assessment below. \n\n223.      Firstly, the EDPB recalls that the basic principles relating to processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as such, be infringed[[369]](#_ftn369). This is apparent from the text of Article 83(5)(a) GDPR which subjects the infringement of the basic principles for processing to administrative fines of up to 20 million euros, or in the case of undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\n\n224.      The EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Article 6(2) and Article 6(3)(b) GDPR refer to  lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing.\n\n225.      On the basis of the above consideration, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s view that “_Article 5(1)(a) links transparency to the overall fairness of the activities of a controller_”407 but considers that the principle of fairness has an independent meaning and stresses that an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of transparency does not automatically rule out the need for an assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness too. \n\n226.      The EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights[[370]](#_ftn370). The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect of the principle of fairness in the context of processing personal data. For example, the EDPB has previously opined in its Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “_[f]airness is an overarching principle which requires that personal data should not be processed in a way that is unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject_”[[371]](#_ftn371). \n\n227.      Among the key fairness elements that controllers should consider in this regard, the EDPB has mentioned autonomy of the data subjects, data subjects’ expectation, power balance, avoidance of deception, ethical and truthful processing[[372]](#_ftn372). These elements are particularly relevant in the case at hand. The principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR underpins the entire data protection framework and seeks to address power asymmetries between the data controllers and the data subjects in order to cancel out the negative effects of such asymmetries and ensure the effective exercise of the data subjects’ rights. The EDPB has previously explained that “_the principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller”_[[373]](#_ftn373)_._ \n\n228.      The EDPB recalls that a fair balance must be struck between, on the one hand, the commercial interests of the controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of the data subjects under the GDPR[[374]](#_ftn374). A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR refers to pursuing “_power balance_” as a “_key objective of the controller-data subject relationship_”[[375]](#_ftn375), especially in the context of online services provided without monetary payment, where users are often not aware of the ways and extent to which their personal data is being processed[[376]](#_ftn376). Consequently, lack of transparency can make it almost impossible in practice for the data subjects to exercise an informed choice over the use of their data[[377]](#_ftn377) which is in contrast with the element of “_autonomy_” of data subjects as to the processing of their personal data[[378]](#_ftn378). \n\n229.      Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is particularly important to ensure that data subjects are protected from any form of abuse and deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal\n\ndata. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into account the particular service that is being provided and the characteristics of their users, serves as a shield from the danger of abuse and deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries. \n\n230.      The EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to the principles of fairness and purpose limitation[[379]](#_ftn379). In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users via the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, compliance with the principle of fairness also relates to “_how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with its social networking service”[**[380]**](#_ftn380)._ Thus the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness requires also an assessment of the consequences that the choice and presentation of the legal basis entail for the users of the Instagram service. In addition, that assessment cannot be made in the abstract, but has to take into account the specificities of the particular social networking service and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising[[381]](#_ftn381). \n\n231.      The EDPB notes that in this particular case the breach of Meta IE’s transparency obligations is of such gravity that it clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of the Instagram users by confusing them on whether clicking the “_Agree to Terms_” button results in giving their consent to the processing of their personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance with the principle of fairness is avoiding deception i.e. providing information “_in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design_”[[382]](#_ftn382).  \n\n232.      As outlined in the Draft Decision, the Complainant argues that Meta IE relied on “_forced consent_” as a result of being led to believe that the legal basis for processing the controller was relying upon was consent[[383]](#_ftn383). The Complaint demonstrates the confusion suffered by the Complainant both due to the (lack of) information presented to Instagram users in the context of their “_agreement_”[[384]](#_ftn384) and the circumstances of how the act of “_agreement_” was sought by Meta IE[[385]](#_ftn385). The EDPB considers that the LSA should have taken into account such Meta IE’s practices in relation to the principle of fairness, regardless of its finding that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use[[386]](#_ftn386).  \n\n233.      In addition, and as recognised by the LSA itself, further to its assessment of the information provided concerning processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “_it is impossible for the user to identify with any degree of specificity what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of_\n\n_the specified lawful bases_”[_**[387]**_](#_ftn387). Considering this, in the EDPB’s view, there are clear indications that Instagram users’ expectations with regard to the applicable legal basis have not been fulfilled[[388]](#_ftn388). Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Instagram users are left “_in the dark_”[[389]](#_ftn389) and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful[[390]](#_ftn390) because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, which ultimately restricts the Instagram users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights.\n\n234.      Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the extensive analysis by the IE SA with regard to the issue of legal basis and transparency in relation to the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is closely linked to the issue of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness. Considering the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Instagram users in a misleading manner[[391]](#_ftn391), which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that the IE SA’s finding of breach of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to the principle of transparency[[392]](#_ftn392) should extend to the principle of fairness too.  \n\n235.      This is all the more supported by the fact that, in the circumstances of the present case as demonstrated above[[393]](#_ftn393), the overall effect of the infringements by Meta IE of the transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and the infringement of Article\n\n6(1)(b) GDPR432 further intensifies the imbalanced nature of the relationship between Meta IE and the Instagram users brought up by the IT SA objection. The combination of factors, such as the asymmetry of the information created by Meta IE with regard to the Instagram service users, combined with the “_take it or leave it_” situation that they are faced with due to the lack of alternative services in the market and the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular processing under the contract with Meta IE, systematically disadvantages the Instagram service users, limits their control over the processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under Chapter III of the GDPR. \n\n236.      Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include a finding of an infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE, in addition to the infringement of the principle of transparency under the same provision, and to adopt the appropriate corrective measures, by addressing, but without being limited to, the question of an administrative fine for this infringement as provided for in Section 9 of this Binding Decision. \n\n# 7 ON THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF PURPOSE LIMITATION AND DATA MINIMISATION \n\n## 7.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n237.      The IE SA refers to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR[[394]](#_ftn394) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR[[395]](#_ftn395) when analysing the extent of the controller’s obligation under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and whether Meta IE has infringed this provision. More specifically, the IE SA highlights that Article 13 GDPR requires that the purposes and legal bases must be specified in respect of the intended processing and cannot just be cited in the abstract[[396]](#_ftn396). After explaining why Meta IE’s view that there is no specific obligation for the legal basis to be mapped to the purpose of processing cannot be reconciled with a literal reading of the GDPR, the IE SA, for completeness, also engages in a systemic reading based on the legislator’s objective and the contents of the GDPR as a whole[[397]](#_ftn397).\n\n238.      In this context, the IE SA points out that the six principles laid down under Article 5 GDPR are interconnected and operate in combination to underpin the whole GDPR[[398]](#_ftn398). However, the IE SA does not assess whether Meta IE’s processing activities entail a separate infringement of the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.\n\n## 7.2 Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs\n\n239.      According to the IT SA, there is an additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on account of Meta IE’s failure to comply with the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles. It considers that such infringement should be found without the need for any further investigation and should result into a substantial increase of the proposed administrative fine[[399]](#_ftn399).\n\n240.      The IT SA puts forward several factual and legal arguments for the proposed change to the Draft Decision. First, it points out that the IE SA confines its assessment to only one of the contracts purposes (the provision of online behavioural advertising), while the Instagram service would actually be composed of several processing activities pursuing several purposes[[400]](#_ftn400). According to the IT SA, the fact that Meta IE inappropriately based its multifarious processing activities only on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR entails an infringement of the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles440. The IT SA stresses the relevance of these principles in online services contracts, as they are not negotiated on an individual basis, and refers to pages 15 and 16 of the WP29 Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation[[401]](#_ftn401). The IT SA also refers to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and recalls that, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently, the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be assessed for each of those services separately[[402]](#_ftn402). \n\n241.      On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the IT SA refers to the risk identified by the WP29 in its Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation[[403]](#_ftn403), namely that “_data controllers may seek to include processing terms in contracts to maximise the possible collection and uses of data without adequately specifying those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations_”[[404]](#_ftn404). In addition, in the IT SA’s view, the failure to specify and communicate the purposes of the processing to the data subject creates a risk of artificially expanding the types of processing or the categories or personal data considered necessary for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which would nullify the safeguards afforded to data subjects under data protection law[[405]](#_ftn405).\n\n## 7.3 Position of the LSA on the objection\n\n242. The IE SA does not consider that the IT SA’s objection is relevant and reasoned[[406]](#_ftn406). Categorising the objection as relating to the scope and conduct of the inquiry, the IE SA adopts the same approach as with regard to the alleged infringement of the principle of fairness. More specifically, the IE SA contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to the parties would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry[[407]](#_ftn407). It highlights the legal consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning infringements outside of the complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would succeed in arguing before the Irish Courts that it has been denied an opportunity to be heard on additional and extraneous findings that are adverse to it[[408]](#_ftn408). The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE was never invited to be heard in response to an allegation that it had infringed the fairness principle set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The IE SA notes, in this regard, that a respondent has the right to be heard in response to the particulars of the case being made against it and that this is a core element of a fair procedure pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view that expanding the material scope of the inquiry is not possible under Irish procedural law[[409]](#_ftn409). It further notes that a very significant risk of procedural unfairness, under Irish national law, would result from the proposal to assume, without any further factual examination, that Meta IE has infringed the purpose limitation principle[[410]](#_ftn410).\n\n## 7.4 Analysis of the EDPB\n\n### 7.4.1 Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned\n\n243.      The IT SA’s objection concerns “_whether there is an infringement of the GDPR_”[[411]](#_ftn411).\n\n244.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA’s objection does not meet the relevant and reasoned thresholds because it falls outside the defined scope of the inquiry[[412]](#_ftn412). As previously explained, the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree with the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection[[413]](#_ftn413). \n\n245.      Meta IE points out that the objection concerns matters that have not been investigated and relates to theoretical findings on legal bases[[414]](#_ftn414). Meta IE further argues that even if the objection satisfied the abovementioned thresholds, it should be disregarded because otherwise Meta IE’s right to fair procedures under both Irish and EU law would be contravened[[415]](#_ftn415). \n\n246.      The EDPB considers that the IT SA objection is **relevant** as it refers to specific parts of the Draft Decision, namely Finding 2 and Finding 3[[416]](#_ftn416), and argues that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR which lay down the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation. \n\n247.      The objection also includes arguments on legal and factual mistakes in the IE SA’s Draft Decision that require amending. According to the IT SA, the IE SA’s reasoning is inconsistent because the high-level, rather unclear information provided to the data subjects is a major criticality that should have led the IE SA not only to question the features of the information notice, but also to verify, in detail, the application of the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation from a substantive perspective[[417]](#_ftn417). More specially, the IT SA takes the view that the IE SA should have had regard to the actual configuration of the processing operations performed in order to assess whether the controller had abided by the obligation to process personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes both when collecting those data and thereafter[[418]](#_ftn418).\n\n248.      As regards the risk posed by the Draft Decision, the EDPB takes note of the IT SA’s reference to paragraph 16 of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and reiterates the particular relevance of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1) (c) GDPR in the context of contracts for online services, in view of the risk that data controllers may seek to include general processing terms in contracts in order to maximise the possible collection and uses of data, without adequately specifying those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations[[419]](#_ftn419). Nevertheless, the EDPB stresses that a mere reference to the EDPB Guidelines is not sufficient to demonstrate the risks posed by the Draft Decision in this specific case and in these specific circumstances. \n\n249.      The IT SA also considers that the purposes for the processing “_must be clearly specified and communicated to the data subject, in line with the controller’s purpose limitation and transparency obligations_”, otherwise there is “_a risk that other data protection obligations might be evaded by artificially expanding the types of processing or the categories of personal data that are considered to_\n\n_be ‘necessary’ for performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR - which would in turn nullify the safeguards afforded to data subjects by personal data protection law_”[[420]](#_ftn420).\n\n250.      The EDPB recalls that the objection must put forward arguments or justifications concerning the consequences of issuing the decision without the changes proposed in the objection, and how such consequences would pose significant risks for data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms[[421]](#_ftn421). The CSA needs to advance sufficient arguments to explicitly show that such risks are substantial and plausible462. In addition, the demonstration of the significance of the risks cannot be implied from the legal and/or factual arguments provided by the CSA, but has to be explicitly identified and elaborated in the objection[[422]](#_ftn422). \n\n251.      The EDPB considers that the IT SA’s objection fails to meet these requirements as it does not demonstrate the significance of the risk stemming from an omission in the Draft Decision of a finding that the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation have been infringed by Meta IE. The risk, as described by the IT SA objection, is not substantial and plausible enough. Moreover, the risk relates to the IE SA’s decision not to conclude on the inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for Meta IE’s processing activities but fails to establish a clear link with the LSA’s decision not to make a finding on the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.  \n\n252.      Therefore, the EDPB considers that the abovementioned objection by the IT SA is **not reasoned** (cf. Article 4(24) GDPR) and will not assess it on the merits. \n\n# 8 ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES OTHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE FINES\n\n## 8.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n253.      The IE SA considers that an order to bring processing into compliance (Art. 58(2)(d) GDPR) should be imposed on Meta IE, requiring them to bring their Data Policy and Terms of Service into compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards processing carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR within three months of the date of notification of any final decision [[423]](#_ftn423). \n\n254.      The LSA considers an order is necessary and proportionate, contrary to the controller’s position[[424]](#_ftn424). Regarding the necessity, the IE SA explains that this order is the only way to guarantee that Meta IE amends the infringements outlined in the Draft Decision, which is essential for the protection of data subjects’ rights[[425]](#_ftn425). Concerning the proportionality, the LSA points out that the proposed measure is the minimum action required to ensure the future compliance of the controller. Further, the IE SA recalls Meta IE’s available resources, the specificity of the LSA’s order, and the importance of the data subject’s rights concerned to conclude that such measure is proportionate[[426]](#_ftn426).\n\n## 8.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs\n\n255.      The NL SA objects to the choice of the corrective measures of the LSA in their Draft Decision[[427]](#_ftn427). The NL SA notes that the IE SA is proposing to impose an order pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR alongside an administrative fine, and that this objection concerns the first of these two measures[[428]](#_ftn428). More specifically, the NL SA objects to the order to bring processing into compliance (Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) within three months proposed by the LSA, arguing that it is not appropriate, not necessary, nor proportionate to ensure compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, as well as the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR raised in its objection470. The NL SA takes the view that the proposed order is insufficient to remedy the serious situation of non-compliance arising from these infringements, since it does not remedy the illegality of the conduct carried out during the transition period (i.e. the time between the issuance of the decision and the expiration date of the order), bearing in mind that every day the service continues operations as described in the Terms of Use and Data Policy, it does so in an illegal way harming the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA[[429]](#_ftn429). According to the NL SA, the Draft Decision should be modified to include a temporary ban on Meta IE’s processing of personal data for the duration necessary for the controller to bring its processing into compliance with the GDPR (Article 58(2)(f) GDPR), as this would be appropriate, necessary and proportionate taking into account the circumstances of the case472, and would be the only measure suitable to make sure that the expansive violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects is not continued[[430]](#_ftn430). The NL SA also argues that the breaches of the GDPR established by the LSA, combined with the additional breaches put forward by the NL SA, are of a very grave nature and justify halting processing operations during the time the controller needs to remedy its severe lack of compliance[[431]](#_ftn431). In essence, the NL SA identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision in that it allows the company to resume operations as usual while amending the compliance deficits (with regard to transparency), which they argue essentially deprives data subjects of their rights during a transition period[[432]](#_ftn432).\n\n256.      The FI SA also argues that the IE SA should “_exercise effective, proportionate and dissuasive corrective powers_” and order Meta IE to “_bring its processing operations into compliance with the provision of Article 6(1) GDPR and prohibit to process users’ personal data for behavioural advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as laid down in Article 58(2)(d) GDPR_”[[433]](#_ftn433). The HU SA reaches the same conclusion, proposing to apply the legal consequences under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR and to instruct the controller to indicate a different legal basis477. On the risks, both the FI and the HU SAs state that the absence of appropriate and necessary corrective powers would amount to a dangerous precedent, sending a deceiving message to the market and to data subjects whose fundamental rights and freedoms would ultimately jeopardise[[434]](#_ftn434). Moreover, the FI SA notes that the Draft Decision affects all data subjects within the EEA and that, therefore, the consequences of not making use of the corrective measures pursuant Article 58(2) would be enormous[[435]](#_ftn435). \n\n257.      The AT SA requests that the LSA makes use of its corrective measures pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR in relation to the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[436]](#_ftn436), in order to bring the processing operations of the controller in line with the GDPR [[437]](#_ftn437) and remedy the infringement[[438]](#_ftn438). According to the AT SA, the IE SA should exercise ‘_’corrective powers’’_ so as to ensure that Meta IE could not continue to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of users’ personal data for behavioral advertising[[439]](#_ftn439). More specifically, the AT SA suggests that the IE SA prohibits Meta IE “_the processing of a user’s data for behavioural advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR_”[[440]](#_ftn440). In the absence of additional corrective measures, the AT SA considers that if corrective measures are not imposed, there is a risk “_that_ [Meta IE] _continues to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of a user’s data for behavioural advertising and continues to undermine or bypass data protection principles’’ [**[441]**](#_ftn441)_, which would affect millions of data subjects within the EEA and bear vast consequences[[442]](#_ftn442). \n\n258.      The FR SA notes that reversing the findings concerning the infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR also affects the scope of the corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative fine[[443]](#_ftn443)\n\n259.      Finally, according to the NO and DE SAs, the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures in relation to the additional infringement of Meta IE with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely to order Meta IE to delete personal data that has been unlawfully processed on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and to prohibit the use of this legal basis for such processing activities[[444]](#_ftn444).\n\n## 8.3 Position of the LSA on the objections\n\n260. The IE SA does not consider the objections above to be relevant and/or reasoned and does not follow them[[445]](#_ftn445).  Given that these objections were premised upon the requirement for the Draft Decision to include a finding of infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on which the IE SA expressed its disagreement, the IE SA does not consider the objections requesting the exercise of a corrective power in response to a finding of infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as being relevant and reasoned[[446]](#_ftn446). \n\n## 8.4 Assessment of the EDPB\n\n### 8.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned\n\n261.      The objections raised by the AT, DE, FI, FR, HU, NL and NO SAs concern “_whether the action envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR_”[[447]](#_ftn447). \n\n262.      In addition to the primary argument levelled against all CSA’s objections, Meta IE provides additional arguments on whether these are relevant and/or reasoned[[448]](#_ftn448). \n\n263.      Meta IE argues the AT and NL SAs’ objection cannot be considered relevant because they are dependent on another objection, which Meta IE deems inadmissible and without merit[[449]](#_ftn449). On the same basis, Meta IE refutes that the AT SA’s objection is adequately reasoned[[450]](#_ftn450).  As stated above, in Section 4.4.1, the EDPB finds the AT and NL SAs’ objections on the subject of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR relevant and reasoned[[451]](#_ftn451). \n\n264.      Additionally, Meta IE argues that the AT and NL SAs’ objections fail to set out how the Draft Decision would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms. First, Meta IE refers to their arguments put forward in response to the AT and NL SAs’ objections on the matter of compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[452]](#_ftn452). The EDPB has taken this line of reasoning into consideration above in Section 4.4.1[[453]](#_ftn453). Second, Meta IE puts forward that the AT and NL SAs appear to consider that the Draft Decision provides “_a mandate for Meta Ireland to unlawfully process data”_[[454]](#_ftn454). Meta IE points out that no such inference can be drawn from the Draft Decision, going on to draw the conclusion that “_as the Draft Decision does not in any way give a blanket approval for any unlawful processing based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, there is no direct and significant risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms_”[[455]](#_ftn455). As to this second line of reasoning, the EDPB fails to see wording by which the AT SA or NL SA might have suggested it understands the Draft Decision as a mandate for Meta Ireland to unlawfully process data, thus limiting future investigations. \n\n265.      The NL SA disagrees with the corrective measure chosen by the IE SA in addition to the administrative fine, arguing a temporary ban on processing (Article 58(2)(f) GDPR) should have been included in the Draft Decision instead of an order to bring processing into compliance. If followed, this objection would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objection to be **relevant**. \n\n266.      The NL SA argues that an order to bring processing into compliance entails that Meta IE would maintain its illegal conduct while they amend their compliance deficits[[456]](#_ftn456). Conversely, a temporary ban on Meta IE’s processing of data would ensure that data processing is halted during the time needed for the company to change its practices to comply with the GDPR[[457]](#_ftn457). In terms of risk, the NL SA puts forward that _‘’not temporarily banning this processing would undermine the effectiveness of the GDPR_’’, and would continue to deprive data subjects of their rights during the transition period[[458]](#_ftn458). The NL SA considers the risk significant, as the controller provides the Instagram service to hundreds of millions of users across Europe and because the processing involves special categories of personal data[[459]](#_ftn459). Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be **reasoned** and to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision.\n\n267.      The AT SA disagrees with a specific part of the IE SA’s Draft Decision, namely Chapter 8 ‘’_Order to bring processing into compliance’’_, arguing that the LSA should have included corrective measures in order to remedy an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[460]](#_ftn460). More specifically, the AT SA suggests that the IE SA prohibits Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[461]](#_ftn461). Therefore, if followed, this objection would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures[[462]](#_ftn462).  In consequence, the EDPB considers the objection to be **relevant**. \n\n268.      Furthermore, the AT SA argues that when an infringement is found - notably in light of other objections raised in the current case in relation to additional infringement of Articles 6(1)(b) - the supervisory authority is under an obligation to issue appropriate corrective measures pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR. In terms of risk, the AT SA argues that without this amendment of the Draft Decision, Meta IE “_could simply continue to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and to undermine data protection principles”_ which would continue to affect millions of data subjects within the EEA[[463]](#_ftn463). Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be **reasoned** and to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision.\n\n269.      Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional and/or alternative specific corrective measures to be imposed are **relevant** and **reasoned** pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.  \n\n270.      In addition, the EDPB recalls the analysis made in Section 4.4.1 above concerning the objections in relation to the additional breach by Meta IE of its lawfulness obligation made by the FR SA (requesting to take appropriate corrective measures), and by the FI and HU SAs (asking the LSA to take corrective measures under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR), which were found to be **relevant** and **reasoned.** \n\n271.      The EDPB recalls that the DE and NO SAs called on the LSA to take specific corrective measures in the event the EDPB followed their objection on compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The EDPB considers these to be reflections upon how, in their view, the LSA should give full effect to the binding direction(s) as set out in the EDPB’s decision[[464]](#_ftn464). In the absence of legal or factual arguments that would justify including these specific corrective measures in the Draft Decision as opposed to others, the EDPB does not consider this aspect of the DE and NO SAs’ objections to meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR as they **are not sufficiently reasoned**.    \n\n### 8.4.2 Assessment on the merits\n\n##### Preliminary matters \n\n272.      The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed in respect of the corrective measures proposed. More specifically, the EDPB needs to assess the request to impose a ban of processing for both the infringements of the transparency obligations found by the LSA and the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR established above in Section 4.4.2, and the connected issue of the corrective measure to be imposed for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objection and its submissions. \n\n273.      By way of introduction, the EDPB highlights that the analysis carried out in this section does not refer to the content of the Draft Decision and of the objections in respect of the imposition of administrative fines, which are covered below in Section 9. \n\n##### Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions\n\n274.      Meta IE considers the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement[[465]](#_ftn465) and that the EDPB lacks competence to determine or adopt decisions on appropriate corrective measures[[466]](#_ftn466). \n\n275.      While Meta IE acknowledges that “_Article 65(1) GDPR allows the EDPB to consider reasoned objections as to whether the envisaged corrective measures comply with the GDPR_”, it argues that CSAs are strictly limited to criticism of the corrective measures already put forward in the Draft Decision by the LSA. Therefore, according to Meta IE, “_should the EDPB find an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR [...], the appropriate course would be to refer the matter back to the LSA (i.e. the DPC) to determine whether to impose any appropriate corrective measures. To do otherwise, including direct the DPC to make a specific order in the terms proposed by certain Objections, would exceed the EDPB’s competence under Article 65 GDPR”_[[467]](#_ftn467). \n\n276.      With respect to the issue of the corrective measure to be imposed for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, if any, Meta IE argues that a temporary ban is neither necessary, nor proportionate to achieve the objective of ensuring compliance with the GDPR, as there exists alternative, less onerous measures to bring its processing operation into compliance with the GDPR512. In addition, Meta IE contends that it would be both unfair and disproportionate to order an immediate ban given that it relied upon a good faith understanding as to what it considered to be a valid legal basis[[468]](#_ftn468). Further, Meta IE considers there is no urgent necessity for a ban based on other decisions taken under the Article 60 GDPR cooperation mechanism in similar circumstances[[469]](#_ftn469). Finally, Meta IE puts forward the significant impact of a temporary ban not only on its activities but also on third parties’ business, such as small and medium sized businesses across Europe, relying on the platform for behavioural advertising 515.\n\n##### EDPB’s assessment on the merits\n\n277.      First of all, according to the EDPB, the views of Meta IE amount to a misunderstanding of the GDPR one-stop-shop mechanism and of the shared competences of the CSAs. The EDPB recalls that the GDPR requires supervisory authorities to cooperate pursuant to Article 60 GDPR to achieve a consistent interpretation of the Regulation[[470]](#_ftn470). The fact that the LSA will be the authority that can ultimately exercise the corrective powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR cannot neither limit the role of the CSAs within the cooperation procedure nor the one of the EDPB in the consistency procedure[[471]](#_ftn471). \n\n278.      More specifically, when raising an objection on the existing or missing corrective measure(s) in the Drafting Decision, the CSAs should indicate which action they believe would be appropriate for the LSA to undertake and include in the final decision[[472]](#_ftn472). In case of disagreement on these objections, the dispute resolution competence of the EDPB covers ‘_’all the matters which are subject of the relevant and reasoned objection_’’ (emphasis added)[[473]](#_ftn473). Therefore, contrary to Meta IE’s views, the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application by the supervisory authorities of their corrective powers, taking into account the range of powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR [[474]](#_ftn474), when a relevant and reasoned objection questions the action(s) envisaged by the Draft Decision vis-a-vis the controller/processor, or the absence thereof. \n\n279.      In addition, the EDPB finds that Meta IE misunderstands the AT SA’s objection when it argues that it does acknowledge that it is for the LSA alone to decide which corrective measures are appropriate and necessary, by citing paragraph 112 of the Schrems II CJEU judgment[[475]](#_ftn475). In fact, the AT SA does no such thing: in its objection it stated ‘’_a complainant does not have a subjective right to request from the respective supervisory authority (in this case: the DPC) the exercise of a specific corrective power and it is for the supervisory authority alone to decide which action is appropriate and necessary (see C_‑_311/18, point 112)_’’ [[476]](#_ftn476) and did not engage in an interpretation of how Article 58(2) GDPR is to be understood in cross-border cases in the sections referred to. The cooperation and consistency mechanism of the GDPR is not addressed in CJEU ruling C-311/18 (Schrems II) either. \n\n280.      Moving on to the analysis of the issue of corrective measures as required by the objections found to be relevant and reasoned above, the EDPB recalls that when a violation of the GDPR has been established, competent supervisory authorities are required to react appropriately to remedy this infringement in accordance with the means provided to them by Article 58(2) GDPR[[477]](#_ftn477). Article 58(2) GDPR provides a wide choice of effective tools for the authorities to take action against infringements of the Regulation and which can be imposed in addition to or instead of a fine. According to Recital 129 GDPR, every corrective measure applied by a supervisory authority under Article 58(2) GDPR should be ‘‘_appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with the Regulation’’_ in light of all the circumstances of each individual case. Recital 148 GDPR shows the duty for supervisory authorities to impose corrective measures that are proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement[[478]](#_ftn478).  This highlights the need for the corrective measures and any exercise of powers by supervisory authorities to be tailored to the specific case525.\n\n281.      Considering the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR established above in Section 4.4.2, as well as the number of data subjects affected, the EDPB shares the view of the AT, FI,\n\nFR, HU and NL SAs that it is particularly important that appropriate corrective measures be imposed, in addition to a fine, in order to ensure that Meta IE complies with this provision of the GDPR.  \n\n282.      In respect of which measure should be imposed, as stated, the NL SA argues that the IE SA's proposal to order Meta IE to comply with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within a period of three months is not appropriate, considering these breaches in conjunction with the gravity of the additional breaches of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR identified in its objection[[479]](#_ftn479). Instead, the NL SA is of the opinion that only a temporary ban imposed in respect of all these infringements can effectively protect the rights of the data subjects during the transition period in which the controller remedies to these violations[[480]](#_ftn480). The FI SA considers that the IE SA should “_exercise effective, proportionate and dissuasive corrective powers_” and, taking into account the nature of the infringement, order Meta IE to “_bring its processing operations into compliance with the provision of Article 6(1) GDPR and prohibit to process users’ personal data for behavioural advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as laid down in Article 58(2)(d) GDPR_”[[481]](#_ftn481). The HU SA proposes to apply the legal consequences under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR in relation to violation of Article 6(1) GDPR by Meta IE and to instruct the controller to indicate a another alternative legal basis[[482]](#_ftn482). In addition, the AT SA calls on the IE SA to use its corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR in order to bring the processing operations of Meta IE into line with the GDPR, and suggests ‘’_that the DPC prohibits Facebook the processing of a user’s data for behavioural advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b)’_ stating that ‘_otherwise, Facebook could simply continue to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR’_’ [[483]](#_ftn483). \n\n283.      Meta IE argues that a temporary ban would not be necessary as less onerous measures could be imposed and that it would be unfair and disproportionate, also considering its impact on third parties[[484]](#_ftn484). \n\n284.      The EDPB agrees with the observations made by the NL SA that the infringement found in the case at hand constitutes a “_very serious situation of non-compliance_”[[485]](#_ftn485) with the GDPR, in relation to processing of “_extensive amounts of [...] data, which is essential to the controller’s business mode”’[**[486]**](#_ftn486)_, thus harming “_the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA_”[[487]](#_ftn487). As a result, the EDPB shares the NL SA’s concern that the corrective measure chosen in the circumstances of this case should aim to bring the processing into compliance with the GDPR thus minimising the potential harm to data subjects created by the violations of the GDPR. \n\n285.      In addition, the EDPB recalls that contrary to Meta IE’s contention, it is not necessary to establish an ‘_urgent necessity’[**[488]**](#_ftn488)_ for imposing a temporary ban, in that nothing in the GDPR limits the application of Article 58(2)(f) GDPR to exceptional circumstances[[489]](#_ftn489).\n\n286.      At the same time, the EDPB notes that in assessing the appropriate measure to be applied, Recital 129 GDPR provides that consideration should be given to ensuring that the measure chosen does not create ‘’_superfluous costs’’_ and ‘’_excessive inconveniences’’_ for the persons concerned in light of the objective pursued. When choosing the appropriate corrective measure, there is a need to assess whether the chosen measure is necessary to enforce the GDPR and achieve protection of the data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data, which is the objective being pursued[[490]](#_ftn490). Compliance with the principle of proportionality requires ensuring that the chosen measure does not create disproportionate disadvantages in relation to the aim pursued.\n\n287.      The EDPB takes note of the elements raised by the objections, particularly the NL SA, to justify the need for imposing a temporary ban, consisting in essence in the need to halt the processing activities that are being undertaken in violation of the GDPR until compliance is ensured in order to avoid further prejudicing data subject rights. However, the EDPB considers that the objective of ensuring compliance and bringing the harm to the data subjects to an end can, in this particular case, be adequately met also by amending the order to bring processing into compliance envisaged in the Draft Decision to reflect Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR identified in Section 4.4.2 of this Binding Decision. In addition to the fines that will be imposed, this measure would require Meta IE to put in place the necessary technical and operational measures to achieve compliance within a set timeframe. \n\n288.      In respect of the imposition of an order to bring processing into compliance, Meta IE submits that any such order should ‘’_afford a reasonable opportunity’’_ to Meta IE to comply[[491]](#_ftn491). When determining the transition period for bringing Meta IE’s processing into compliance with GDPR, the EDPB requests that the IE SA gives due regard to the harm caused to the data subjects by the continuation of Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR during this period. More specifically, the order should require Meta IE to restore compliance within a short period of time. In this respect, the EDPB notes that, in response to Meta IE’s submission, the IE SA considered the three-month deadline for compliance for the infringements of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR necessary and proportionate in light of the potential for harms to the data subjects rights that such a measure entails, considering that the interim period for compliance ‘’_will involve a serious ongoing deprivation of their rights_’’[[492]](#_ftn492). The LSA also points out the significant financial, technological, and human resources, as well as the\n\nclear instructions provided to Meta IE to comply with GDPR[[493]](#_ftn493). The EDPB considers that this line of reasoning applies all the more to the corrective measures imposed in relation to Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. \n\n289.      Finally, the EDPB recalls that non-compliance with an order issued by a supervisory authority can be relevant both in terms of it being subject to administrative fines up to 20 million euros or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year in line with Article 83(6) GDPR, and in terms of it being an aggravating factor for the imposition of administrative fines[[494]](#_ftn494). In addition, the investigative powers of supervisory authorities allow them to order the provision of all the information necessary for the performance of their tasks including the verification of compliance with one of their orders542. \n\n290.      The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Instagram services into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months.\n\n291.      In addition,  the EDPB notes that the current wording of the order “_to bring the Data Policy and Terms of Use into compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR_”’ should be modified in order to reflect the EDPB’s findings in Section 4.4.2 that Meta IE is not allowed to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising. Therefore, the EDPB instructs the LSA to adjust its order to Meta IE to bring its Instagram Data Policy and Terms of Use into compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months, to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also on data processed for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of Instagram services (to reflect the finding of the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 that for this processing the controller cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).  \n\n# 9  ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINE \n\n292. The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines[[495]](#_ftn495). \n\n## 9.1 On the determination of the administrative fine for the transparency infringements\n\n### 9.1.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\nThe application of the criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR\n\n293. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA explains how it considered the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and to determine its amount in the circumstances of this case [[496]](#_ftn496). The most pertinent criteria for the present dispute are summarised below.\n\n##### The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)\n\n294.      The IE SA explains that it assesses the infringements of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR identified in the Draft Decision simultaneously in the context of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria [[497]](#_ftn497). Further, the IE SA explains that ‘_’the processing concerned’’_ refers to “_all of the processing operations that_ [Meta IE] _carries out in the context of the Instagram service on the personal data under its controllership for which it relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR_”, in line with the scope of the inquiry (permissibility in principle of processing personal data for behavioural advertising)[[498]](#_ftn498). \n\n295.      In terms of the **nature of the infringements,** the IE SA explains that they concern a cornerstone of data subject rights, namely the right to information. The IE SA argues that ”_the provision of the information concerned goes to the very heart of the fundamental right of the individual to protection of personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to share their personal data in a voluntary situation such as this. If the required information has not been provided, the data subject has been deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision as to whether they wish to use a service that involves the processing of their personal data and engages their associated rights. Furthermore, the extent to which a data controller has complied with its transparency obligations has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the other data subject rights. If data subjects have not been provided with the prescribed information, they may be deprived of the knowledge they need in order to consider exercising one of the other data subject rights_”[[499]](#_ftn499). Further, the IE SA points out that the breach of the transparency principle by Meta IE has the potential to undermine other fundamental data protection principles sur as the principles of fairness and accountability[[500]](#_ftn500). Finally, the IE SA notes that the European legislator included infringements on the right to information and Article 5 GDPR in Article 83(5) GDPR, which carries the highest maximum fine[[501]](#_ftn501).\n\n296.      In terms of the **gravity of the infringements**, the IE SA explains that Meta IE is found to also have infringed Article 12(1) and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR because the company has not provided the required information in the required manner under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. The IE SA adds that this _“represents a significant level of non-compliance, taking into account the importance of the right to information, the consequent impact on the data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects potentially affected_”[[502]](#_ftn502). \n\n297.      With regards to the **nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned**, the IE SA considers that the “_processing carried out by_ [Meta IE] _in the context of the Instagram service pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive._ [Meta IE] _processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a ‘personalised’_ _experience, including by way of serving personalised advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered, and, for this reason, the provision of compliant information in relation to that processing becomes even more important. This, indeed, may include location and IP address data_”[[503]](#_ftn503). \n\n298.      With reference to the **number of data subjects affected**, the IE SA points out that, as Meta IE confirmed, _’’as of the date of the commencement of the Inquiry, i.e. 31 August 2018,_ [Meta IE] _had approximately_  _monthly active accounts and, as of December 2021, it had approximately_   _monthly active users in the European Economic Area_” [[504]](#_ftn504). While noting the figures provided by Meta IE incorrectly excluded the number of UK active accounts to which the GDPR was applicable at the date of the Complaint, the LSA considered that, when measuring these figures by reference to the total population of the EEA (including the UK), a ‘_’significant portion of the population of the EEA seems to have been impacted by the infringements_’’ [[505]](#_ftn505).\n\n299.      In terms of **damages suffered** by affected data subjects, the IE SA finds that “_failure to provide all of the prescribed information undermines the effectiveness of the data subject rights and, consequently, infringes the rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned. A core element of transparency is empowering data subjects to make informed decisions about engaging with activities that cause their personal data to be processed, and making informed decisions about whether to exercise particular rights, and whether they can do so. This right is undermined by a lack of transparency on the part of a data controller_”554.  \n\n300.      On Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, the IE SA concludes that _“_[the] _infringements are serious in nature. The lack of transparency goes to the heart of data subject rights and risks undermining their effectiveness by not providing transparent information in that regard. While the infringements considered here relate_\n\n_to one lawful basis, it nonetheless concerns vast swathes of personal data impacting millions of data subjects. When such factors are considered, it is clear that the infringements are serious in their gravity_”[[506]](#_ftn506). The IE SA further notes the impact of the infringement on a ‘_’significant portion of the population of the EEA’’_, as well as on _‘’data subject’s ability to be fully informed about their data protection rights, or indeed about whether in their view they should exercise those rights’’_ 556.\n\n301.      The IE SA does not attach significant weight to the duration of the infringements557, considering that the complaint - and therefor the Inquiry - was made against a specific set of documents (Instagram’s Data Policy and Terms of Use) and that more recent versions of the relevant documents are outside the scope of the Inquiry[[507]](#_ftn507). \n\n##### The intentional or negligent character of the infringements (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)\n\n302. The IE SA notes the complainants view that the infringement arose from ‘’[Meta IE] _made a deliberate and calculated decision to present the information in a particular manner such as to mislead data subject’_’ [[508]](#_ftn508) but states that there is no evidence that Meta IE ‘_’made a deliberate decision to present the information to data subject in a particular way_’’ [[509]](#_ftn509). The IE SA further notes that the EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines ‘_’recognise that an intentional breach generally only occurs where there is a deliberate act to infringe the GDPR_’’, and that, in this regard, ‘_’a finding of intentionality is predicated on knowledge and wilfulness as to characteristics of an offence_’’. The IE SA finds there was no evidence of an intentional and knowing breach of a provision of the GDPR.  The IE SA however finds that the infringement was negligent, taking into account ‘_’the failure of an organisation of this size to provide sufficiently transparent materials in relation to the core of its business mode_”561.\n\n##### The action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects (Article 83(2)(c) GDPR)\n\n303. The IE SA notes Meta IE’s position that “_has discharged its transparency obligations in respect of the Instagram service and, accordingly, complies fully with the GDPR in this respect_.” Notwithstanding their disagreement with this position, the IE SA “_accept_[s] _that it represents a genuinely held belief on_ [Meta IE’s] _part_’’. On that basis, the IE SA notes that ‘_’there has not been an effort to mitigate the damage to data subjects, as it was [Meta IE’s] position that data subjects were incurring no such damage_”[[510]](#_ftn510). The IE SA is not swayed by Meta IE’s argument that their efforts to comply with the GDPR should be taken into consideration, as - in general - compliance with the GDPR is a duty imposed on each controller. In the present case, the IE SA finds this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating insofar as “_beyond simply complying with the GDPR, there are no obvious mitigating steps that could have been taken_”[[511]](#_ftn511). Notwithstanding this, the IE SA identifies a mitigating factor in Meta IE’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the conclusion of the inquiry[[512]](#_ftn512).\n\n##### The degree of responsibility of the controller taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR)\n\n304.      The IE SA does mention this factor as an aggravating factor in the Draft Decision. The IE SA takes the view that, considering that guidance on transparency was available to Meta IE at the date of the complaint, it _’’should have been aware of the appropriate standards – albeit at a general level – and, having made a deliberate decision to present the information in a manner which fell significant below the standard required, has a high degree of responsibility for the lack of compliance with the GDPR’’_[[513]](#_ftn513). _Any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR)_ \n\n305.      The IE SA does not mention this factor as an aggravating or mitigating factor in the Draft Decision [[514]](#_ftn514), taking into consideration that ‘_’the Commission has not made any findings of infringements by Meta Ireland in the context of the Instagram service which could be considered relevant for_ [this] _assessment’’_ [[515]](#_ftn515).\n\n##### The categories of personal data affected by the infringements (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR)\n\n306.      The IE SA notes that “[the] _lack of transparency concerned broad categories of personal data relating to users who sign up to the Instagram service”_568. Although acknowledging that the assessment made by the IE SA in this Inquiry “_was rather generalised in nature_” the LSA points out that the lack of transparency by Meta IE contributed to the “_lack of clarity as to the precise categories of personal data relevant for this Inquiry_”569. \n\n307.      Nonetheless, the IE SA concludes that, in the absence of evidence that these personal data are of a particularly sensitive nature, this factor should be regarded as neither aggravating nor mitigating[[516]](#_ftn516).\n\n##### The manner in which the infringements became known to the supervisory authority (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR)\n\n308. The IE SA notes that “[the] _subject matter became known to the Commission due to an Inquiry conducted on foot of the Complaint. The subject matter did not give rise to any requirement of notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief is that no infringement is/was occurring_”[[517]](#_ftn517). The IE SA does not mention this factor as an aggravating or mitigating factor in the Draft Decision[[518]](#_ftn518). \n\n##### Any other aggravating or mitigating factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)\n\n309.      The IE SA considers whether the “_lack of transparency has the potential to have resulted in financial benefits for_ [Meta IE]” based on the view that a “_more transparent approach to processing operations carried out on foot of that contract would represent a risk to_ [Meta IE]_’s business model”_, which would be the case “_if existing or prospective users were dissuaded from using the Instagram service by clearer explanations of the processing operations carried out, and their purposes”_. The IE SA concludes that this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating, arguing that “_any general consideration of this_ [factor] _ultimately involves an element of speculation on both_ [Meta IE]_’s and the Commission’s part”_[[519]](#_ftn519). \n\nThe application of the criteria under Article 83(1) GDPR\n\n310.      Based on these circumstances, the IE SA considers that administrative fines pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR and Article 83 GDPR, totaling an amount not less than €18 million and an amount not more than €23 million should be issued on Meta IE for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of Instagram service[[520]](#_ftn520). \n\n311.      The LSA considers that the proposed administrative fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive taking into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry[[521]](#_ftn521). Regarding the effectiveness, the IE SA argues that the “_infringements are serious, both in terms of the extremely large number of data subjects potentially affected, the categories of personal data involved, and the consequences that flow from the failure to comply with the transparency requirements for users_”[[522]](#_ftn522). Concerning the dissuasiveness, the LSA states that the fine must “_dissuade both the controller/processor concerned as well as other controllers/processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the conduct concerned_”[[523]](#_ftn523). As regards the proportionality, the IE SA considers that the fines proposed “_do not exceed what is necessary to enforce compliance with the GDPR, taking into account the size of Instagram user base, the impact of the infringements on the effectiveness of the data subject rights enshrined in Chapter III of the GDPR and the importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR as a whole_”578. \n\n312.      The IE SA refers to the need to take into account the undertaking’s turnover in the calculation of the maximum possible fine amounts[[524]](#_ftn524). The notion of “_undertaking_” is determined to refer to Meta Platforms, Inc. [[525]](#_ftn525). The IE SA takes into consideration the revenue reported by Meta Platforms, Inc. for the year ending 31 December 2020 ($85.965 billion)[[526]](#_ftn526). \n\n### 9.1.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs\n\n313.      The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs [[527]](#_ftn527) object to the envisaged action taken by the LSA with regard to the administrative fine proposed in the Draft Decision concerning the infringements of the transparency obligations by asking the IE SA to impose **a (significantly)[**[528]**](#_ftn528) higher administrative fine with reference to the established infringements.**  \n\n314.      The dispute arising from these objections concerns whether the proposed fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR [[529]](#_ftn529). With reference to these three criteria, the above mentioned CSAs, specifically, argue as follows. \n\n315.      According to the DE SAs, the fine proposed by the LSA in the Draft Decision is not proportionate with regard to the financial position of the undertaking. More specifically, the DE SAs argue that the envisaged fine of at most 23 million euros is not proportionate compared to the worldwide annual turnover on Meta Platforms, Inc[[530]](#_ftn530). The DE SAs point out that the proposed fine ‘’_represents only about 0.03% of the turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc. and about 0.72% of the maximum fine_“ 586. With respect to dissuasiveness, the DE SAs consider that the fine proposed by the LSA “_weakens the position of supervisory authorities and endangers compliance with the GDPR’’_ as this would leave controllers under the impression that “_enforcement of the GDPR will not be felt economically’’_ 587. \n\n316.      The FR SA argues that the amount of the envisaged fine “_seems low and hardly compatible with the objective set by Article 83(1) GDPR of ensuring to impose dissuasive fines_” taking into account “_the number of data subjects concerned, the particularly intrusive nature of the processing operations in question, the breaches observed, the position of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited as a quasi-monopolist and its financial situation_”[[531]](#_ftn531). In this respect, the FR SA notes that the fine proposed by the IE SA is no proportionate since “_the cumulative amount of the two breaches of the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) and 13-1-c) of the GDPR, on the one hand, and the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) and 12-1 of the GDPR, on the other hand, represents only about 0.03% of the turnover of Meta Platforms Inc. and less than 1% of the maximum fine_”[[532]](#_ftn532). \n\n317.      The IT SA argues that  ‘_’by having regard to the controller, in particular the nature and size of Meta Platforms Inc. [...] the range at issue would appear to be overly low and neither proportionate nor dissuasive’’_ [[533]](#_ftn533).\n\n318.      The NL SA doubts, also referring to the EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, that the fines proposed by the IE SA meet the objective to be effective, “_particularly considering the strong financial position of the controller and the finding that the_ _identified lack of transparency likely has had financial benefits for the controller_”[[534]](#_ftn534). As regard to dissuasiveness, the NL SA argues, also referring to established CJEU case-law, that Meta IE “_generates a turnover of over 86 billion dollars (approximately 79 billion euros) per annum, therefore it would be able to generate a daily revenue of approximately 235 million dollars. Instead of dissuading future behaviour, the penalty would be simply regenerated in a few hours_” (specific deterrence)[[535]](#_ftn535). With reference to proportionality, the NL SA questions the lack of reasoning in the Draft Decision as to why the amounts proposed are commensurate to the seriousness of the infringements[[536]](#_ftn536).\n\n319.      The NO SA argues that the envisaged amount of the fine is not effective nor dissuasive neither to Meta IE nor to other controllers, considering the financial benefits accrued because of the violation and worldwide annual turnover of Meta Platform, Inc. for 2020[****[537]****](#_ftn537) In particular, the NO SA points out that Meta IE “_would likely have no issue paying the proposed fine, and the amount of the fine it is not likely to affect_ [it] _in such a way that it would see a need to substantially change its practices” [**[538]**](#_ftn538)._ The NO SA illustrates this by the fact that in 2020, Meta IE set aside one billion euro of provisions to address, inter alia, the risk of fines for infringement to the data protection rules596.\n\n320.      In addition, these objections raise arguments with regards to the weight afforded to some of the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. \n\n321.      The IT SA objects to the LSA's decision not to consider WhatsApp's previous infringements in the case IN-18-12-2 as an aggravating circumstance under Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, insofar as it is part of the same group of companies of Meta IE. According to the IT SA “_even though the WhatsApp case did raise additional, more specific issues, one can hardly question that the relevant decision sets a key precedent_\n\n_in assessing controller’s repetitive conduct_’’ as ‘_’not only did the controller in question clearly stick to the same business model in offering its different social networking services, it also did not change its assessment as to how to manage users’ data with particular regard to its information and transparency obligations_’’ [[539]](#_ftn539).\n\n322.      According to the DE, FR, NL and NO SAs, the fine proposed by the LSA in the Draft Decision is not proportionate with regard to the seriousness of the infringement[[540]](#_ftn540). \n\n323.      The NL SA argues that the fine is not commensurate with the seriousness of the infringements established (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) and is inconsistent with the IE SA's qualifications as such[[541]](#_ftn541). The FR SA also argues that the fine is in contradiction with the seriousness of the violations identified and the nature of the processing (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)[[542]](#_ftn542) . \n\n324.      The DE, FR, and IT SAs state that the fine proposed is not consistent with the amount retained by the\n\nIE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against the company WhatsApp Ireland Limited (case IN-1812-2), in which the IE SA imposed an administrative fine of 225 million euros, including a fine of 30 million euros for the infringement of Article 12 and 13 GDPR and a fine of 90 million on account of the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR [[543]](#_ftn543). Moreover, the FR and IT SAs state that the amount proposed appears low also in comparison with the one retained by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core, where an administrative fine of 746 million euros has been imposed for the infringements of Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR, and which was also  based on a complaint that the processing operations carried out by the companies of the Amazon group relating to behavioural advertising did not have a valid legal basis[[544]](#_ftn544). In addition, the FR SA notes that the amount of the fine proposed by the IE SA “_seems to be underestimated in comparison with the amount retained in the deliberation of the CNIL’s restricted committee No. SAN-2019- 001 of 21 January 2019 imposing a penalty of 50 million euros on the company Google LLC”_ [[545]](#_ftn545). The FR SA considers this case as comparable because it is also based on a referral “_filed by the association ‘NOYB’ with the CNIL, relating to a similar issue and formulated against Google, and that the restricted committee has identified a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR and a breach of the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR” 604_. However, the FR SA notes that “_the amount retained against Google LLC is close to that proposed by the Irish data protection authority, even though the processing operations in question concern all European users, [...] which was not the case in the above-mentioned CNIL’s decision, for which only French users were taken into account_”[[546]](#_ftn546). \n\n325.      The NO SA argues that “_the suggested fine is not proportionate to the seriousness of the violations and the aggravating factors identified_”, the “_number of data subjects affected in the EEA amounts to hundreds of millions_” and agrees with the LSA that the controller’s “_level of responsibility is high_”[[547]](#_ftn547). \n\n326.      On the **risks** posed by the Draft Decision, the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs consider that, if adopted, the Draft Decision would lead to a significant risk for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects[[548]](#_ftn548). The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs explain that it would not ensure an effective enforcement of the GDPR, as the proposed fine is unable to create a deterrent effect (either specifically towards the controller, or in general towards other controllers)[[549]](#_ftn549). The NO SA considers this would mean, “_that the complainant and the affected data subjects would in practice be denied the level of data protection set out in the GDPR_”[[550]](#_ftn550). The FR SA argues the Draft Decision as it stands would “_lead to a levelling down of the level of administrative fines imposed by European data protection authorities, thereby reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure effective compliance with the protection of the personal data of European residents_”[[551]](#_ftn551). The DE SAs add that “_the Draft Decision does not ensure a consistent application of administrative fines_”[[552]](#_ftn552). \n\n### 9.1.3 Position of the LSA on the objections\n\n327.      The LSA considers none of the objections relating to the _quantum_ of the proposed administrative fine as relevant and reasoned[[553]](#_ftn553).  \n\n328.      In relation to objections calling for an increase of the amount of the fine set out in the Draft Decision, the LSA states that notwithstanding the variance between the views of the CSAs on the calculation of the fine that the IE SA has “_fully taken into account the criteria at Article 83(2) GDPR, and that the proposed administrative fines meet the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR, taking into account all the circumstances of this matter and as set out Part 9 of the Draft Decision” [**[554]**](#_ftn554)_. The IE SA also argues that the IE SA considers “_the proposal as to the fine to be meaningful in terms of both the financial significance of it on any view, as well as the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract’’_ [[555]](#_ftn555). \n\n329.      With reference to the objections relating to the mode of calculating the proposed administrative fine (assessment of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria), the LSA does not accept that these objections are relevant[[556]](#_ftn556). The LSA recalls that it has already examined in its Draft Decision whether the infringements were intentional and whether Meta IE obtained a financial benefit as a result of the infringements, questions to which it answered in the negative[[557]](#_ftn557). Furthermore, the LSA takes the view\n\nthat “_it would be contrary to a literal interpretation of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR to take the decision made by the IE SA in respect of WhatsApp Ireland Limited (i.e. IN-18-2-1) in the calculation of the fine for this Draft Decision in circumstances where the infringements do not concern the same controller or processor’’ [**[558]**](#_ftn558)_. \n\n### 9.1.4 Assessment of the EDPB\n\n##### 9.1.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned\n\n330.      The objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs concern ‘_’whether the action envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR_’’ [[559]](#_ftn559). \n\n331.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR [[560]](#_ftn560). \n\n332.      With specific regard to these objections on the determination of the administrative fine for the transparency infringements, Meta IE acknowledges that the objections as to whether envisaged corrective measures comply with the GDPR fall within the scope of the dispute resolution mechanism[[561]](#_ftn561), however in their view, objections that solely object to the amount of a fine are outside the scope of this mechanism[[562]](#_ftn562). Meta IE argues that ‘’_the DPC, as the LSA, has the sole competence and discretion to impose an administrative fine_’’ 622. Moreover, Meta IE claims that the EDPB is not competent to determine whether the administrative fine is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive[[563]](#_ftn563). The EDPB does not share this reading of the GDPR, as explained above (see Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 277-279 of this Binding Decision) and considers that CSAs may object to the fine amount proposed by an LSA in its draft decision[[564]](#_ftn564). \n\n333.      The EDPB takes note of further arguments put forward by Meta IE, aiming to demonstrate the lack of relevance of the objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs[[565]](#_ftn565). Meta IE disagrees with the content of these objections, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility.  \n\n334.      The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs disagree with specific parts of the IE SA’s Draft Decision, namely the assessment made by the LSA in Chapter 9 ‘_’Administrative fine’’_ and Chapter 10 ‘_’Other relevant factors’’_ in setting the administrative fine applicable to the violations of transparency identified[[566]](#_ftn566). If followed, these objections would lead to a different conclusion in terms of corrective measures imposed. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs to be **relevant.**\n\n335.      Meta IE further considers that the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs’ objections have not created “_reasonable doubt’_’ as to the validity of the LSA’s calculation of the fine and do not explain why the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision is incompatible with Article 83 GDPR [[567]](#_ftn567). In this respect, Meta IE claims that the objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs are not sufficiently reasoned as they focus on hypothetical “_preventive effects”_ of the fine on other controllers in future proceedings[[568]](#_ftn568). In addition, Meta IE puts forward that the comparison made by the DE, FR, and IT SAs in their objections with other fines imposed in other cases is not relevant to the extent that fines should result in a case-by-case assessment[[569]](#_ftn569). Meta IE also objects to the FR SA’s objection that the fine should be tied to the turnover, considering that Meta IE’s turnover is only relevant for determining the maximum fine amount under Articles 83(4)-(6) GDPR and not the fine amount[[570]](#_ftn570). Finally, in response to the NO SA’s objection, Meta IE argues that controller’s financial provisions for potential regulatory-related expenses cannot be considered as a relevant factor under Article 83(2) GDPR[[571]](#_ftn571). It follows from the above arguments that Meta IE disagrees with the reasoning provided in these objections, which thus concerns the merits and not the admissibility of the objection. \n\n336.      The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs argue why they propose amending the Draft Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed, i.e. why they propose to impose a higher fine for the transparency breaches[[572]](#_ftn572). \n\n337.      In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk to fundamental rights and argues the objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs fail to demonstrate the contrary, as required[[573]](#_ftn573).\n\n338.      In particular, Meta IE considers that the DE, FR SA and IT SAs’ objections appear to focus on increasing the “_punitive impact”_ of the fine on Meta IE, instead of demonstrating any significant risks to the fundamental rights of data subjects[[574]](#_ftn574). Meta IE further claims that the NL and NO SAs’ objections does not set out how the proposed fine would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms[[575]](#_ftn575). In addition, Meta IE argues the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs’ objections rest on unsubstantiated possible effect the Draft Decision could have on future behaviour of other controllers, without demonstrating how this Decision would lead to significant risks in the case at hand[[576]](#_ftn576) . Therefore, Meta IE claims that, in doing so, the assessment made by the DE, FR, IT and NL SAs is incorrect as they do not consider the reputational costs generated by such a fine[[577]](#_ftn577). \n\n339.      First, the EDPB notes that any risk assessment addresses future outcomes which are to some degree uncertain, and finds there is no basis in the GDPR to limit the notion of risks to the boundaries of the particular case at hand.  Article 4(24) GDPR refers to the risks posed to the \"_fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects_\" and “_where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union_”. Both of these aspects are phrased in a general way. The wording of this provision does not in any way limit the demonstration of the risks to showing the risks posed to the data subjects affected by the concrete processing carried out by the specific controller, in light of the objective of guaranteeing a ‘_’high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individual_s’’ [[578]](#_ftn578). Therefore, the risks posed by a draft decision to be demonstrated by a relevant and reasoned objection might also concern data subjects whose personal data might be processed in the future, including by other controllers.  \n\n340.      The EDPB also notes that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs[[579]](#_ftn579) considered both of the aspects that are entailed by dissuasiveness of the fine, i.e. specific deterrence and general deterrence[[580]](#_ftn580).  \n\n341.      The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs articulate an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals641.\n\n342.      Therefore, the EDPB considers the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs objections to be **reasoned**.\n\n#####            9.1.4.1    9.1.4.2. Assessment on the merits\n\n343.      In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR.\n\n344.      The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines642. A fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, as required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the case643. In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.\n\n345.      The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s argument that the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above (see Section 8.4.2,  paragraphs 277 -279 as well as footnote 624). \n\n346.      The finding in the Draft Decision of a transparency infringement for the processing concerned still stands. The EDPB recalls that, on substance, no objections were raised on this finding. Meta IE infringed its general transparency obligations by being unclear on the link between the purposes of processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved644, irrespective of the validity of the legal basis relied on for the ‘processing concerned’. It remains the case that, for the transparency infringements, ‘‘_the processing concerned’’_ should be understood as meaning all of the processing operations that Meta IE carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which Meta IE indicated it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR645, including for the purposes of behavioural advertising. This is without prejudice to the fact that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising as part of the delivery of  its Instagram service under the Terms of Use. Whether or not Meta IE appropriately chose its legal basis for processing, the transparency infringement as assessed in the Draft Decision still stands. Therefore, the IE SA must not modify this description retro-actively in light of the assessment of the validity of the legal basis, including for the purpose of carrying out any reassessment of the administrative fines originally proposed by the Draft Decision, as might be required by this Binding Decision.\n\n_alia,_ Judgement of the Court of Justice of 13 June 2013, Versalis Spa v European Commission, C-511/11 P, ECLI:EU:C:2013:386, (hereinafter ‘C-511/11, Versalis’), paragraph 94.  \n\n641  DE SAs Objection, p. 12, FR SA Objection, paragraphs 47-48; IT SA Objection, pp.8-9; NL SA Objection, paragraph 52; NO SA Objection, p. 12. See also EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 37.\n\n642  Recital 150 GDPR. EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 34; EDPB Guidelines on Administrative fines p. 7 (“_When the relevant and reasoned objection raises the issue of the compliance of the corrective measure with the GDPR, the decision of EDPB will also discuss how the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence are observed in the administrative fine proposed in the draft decision of the competent supervisory authority_”). \n\n643  EDPB Guidelines on Administrative fines, p. 7; EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraphs 132-134.\n\n644  Draft Decision, paragraph 189.\n\n645  Draft Decision, paragraph 210.\n\n347.      In light of the objections found relevant and reasoned, the EDPB addresses whether the Draft Decision proposes a fine for the transparency infringements that is in accordance with the criteria established by Article 83(2) GDPR and the criteria provided for by Article 83(1) GDPR. In doing this, the EDPB will first assess the disputes arisen in respect of the analysis of specific criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR performed by the LSA, and then examine whether the proposed fine meets the requirements of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality set in Article 83(1) GDPR, including by affording adequate weight to the relevant factors and to the circumstances of the case. \n\n##### On any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR)  \n\n348.      Article 83(2)(e) GDPR requires supervisory authorities to give due regard to any previous relevant infringement of the GDPR by the controller or processor as one of the circumstances that justifies an increase in the basic amount of the fine. As similar reference can be found in Recital 148 GDPR.\n\n349.      For the purposes of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, both previous infringements of the same subject matter and infringements of a different subject matter but committed in a manner similar to that under investigation, should be considered as relevant. Furthermore, the EDPB recalls that the scope of assessment of infringements may include not only previous decisions by the investigating supervisory authority, but also infringements found by other authorities, provided that they are relevant to the case under investigation[[581]](#_ftn581).  \n\n350.      The EDPB first notes that, contrary to Meta IE’s views[[582]](#_ftn582), substantial similarities exist in the infringements found by the LSA in its draft decision and in its decision IN-18-12-2 in relation to WhatsApp Ireland Limited and in which breach of GDPR obligations were established. As rightly pointed out by the IT SA, the LSA indeed considered in both decisions that the controller had not provided transparent information on the legal basis and purposes of the processing operations or sets of processing operations carried out, thereby infringing Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR[[583]](#_ftn583). \n\n351.      The IT SA contends that, to the extent that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are part of the same corporate group, the previous decision concerning WhatsApp Ireland Limited “_sets a key precedent in assessing a controller’s repetitive conduct_”, as “_not only did the controller in question clearly stick to the same business model in offering its different social networking services, it also did not change its assessment as to how to manage users’ data with particular regard to its information and transparency obligations_”649. The IE SA disagrees with this objection, considering that Article 83(2)(e)\n\nGDPR cannot apply in the circumstances of this case insofar as its decision against WhatsApp Ireland Limited was addressed to a different controller[[584]](#_ftn584). \n\n352.      In this respect, the EDPB notes that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are both subsidiaries of Meta Platforms, Inc. [[585]](#_ftn585). Nonetheless, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR draws a distinction between on the one hand the “_controller_” or “_processor_”[[586]](#_ftn586), which are responsible for complying with the rules of the GDPR, and on the other hand the “_undertaking_”[[587]](#_ftn587)  to which the controller or processor is part of, and that may be found jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine654. In this context, Article 83(2)(e) GDPR explicitly refers to the need to consider previous relevant infringements committed ‘_’by the controller or processor’’_ (emphasis added). \n\n353.      Therefore, the EDPB considers that the Final Decision does not need to refer to the infringements by WhatsApp Ireland Limited, as established in Decision IN-18-12-2, as an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(e) GDPR for the calculation of the fine. \n\n##### The effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness of the administrative fine (Article 83(1) GDPR)\n\n354.      With regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour, or both[[588]](#_ftn588). In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again)[[589]](#_ftn589). Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages both the controller or processor concerned as well as other controllers or processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct. Proportionality of the fine needs also to be ensured as the measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective[[590]](#_ftn590). In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s views that there is no basis to conclude that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive effect[[591]](#_ftn591).\n\n355.      The EDPB reiterates that it is incumbent upon the supervisory authorities to verify whether the amount of the envisaged fines meets the requirements of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple infringements, increases and decreases for aggravating and mitigating circumstances and financial/socio-economic circumstances[[592]](#_ftn592). Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is not an arithmetically precise exercise[[593]](#_ftn593), and supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in this respect[[594]](#_ftn594).\n\n356.      The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs , object to the level of the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision as they consider the proposed fine not effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR)[[595]](#_ftn595). \n\n357.      These CSAs argue that the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR are not weighed correctly by the LSA when calculating the administrative fines in the present case, in light of the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR[[596]](#_ftn596). Specifically, the DE, FR, IT,  NL and NO SAs argue that the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision is not proportionate with IE SA’s findings in relation to the nature and seriousness of the infringements and the number of data subjects concerned[[597]](#_ftn597).\n\n358.      In addition, these CSAs argue that the fine is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive taking into account the financial position of Meta Platform, Inc. [[598]](#_ftn598).\n\n359.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s disagreement with the fine proposed by the IE SA[[599]](#_ftn599) and their view that the LSA already considers all factors it considered to be relevant to Article 83(2) GDPR and that ‘_’none of the CSAs have created any reasonable doubt as to the validity of the DPC’s calculation_’’ [[600]](#_ftn600). \n\n360.      The EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA indicates being satisfied the proposed fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive, taking into account all the circumstances of the IE SA’s inquiry668. The IE SA assessed the different criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR in relation to the transparency infringements found[[601]](#_ftn601). The IE SA considered the infringements as serious in nature[[602]](#_ftn602), and in terms of gravity of the infringements found a significant level of non-compliance[[603]](#_ftn603). Furthermore, the EDPB underlines that, as established by the IE SA, the infringements affect a significant number of data subjects[[604]](#_ftn604) and are extensive[[605]](#_ftn605). The EDPB also observes that the IE SA considered the negligent character of the infringement[[606]](#_ftn606), as well as the high level of responsibility of Meta IE for the lack of compliance with the GDPR[[607]](#_ftn607) as aggravating factors under Article 83(2) GDPR. Further, the IE SA qualified the level of damage suffered by data subjects as significant[[608]](#_ftn608). In addition, the IE SA identified only one mitigating factor, without indicating, however, whether this should lead to a slight or substantial reduction of the fine range[[609]](#_ftn609).\n\n361.      Meta IE argues that reputation costs should also be taken into consideration, citing the IE SA’s remark on _“the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract”_[[610]](#_ftn610).  On principle, the EDPB agrees that reputation costs could be taken into consideration to some extent, if credible arguments are put forward about the grave detriment that would ensue. Meta IE does not present such arguments[[611]](#_ftn611). The EDPB is of the view that in this case other incentives would offset any reputational costs. As far as advertisers are concerned, Meta IE puts forward that “_The personalised nature of the Instagram Service_ _is also the reason why it has been instrumental in the success of small and medium sized businesses (“SMBs”) worldwide, including across the EU. Personalisation on social media and other digital technologies, including the Instagram Service, enables SMBs to compete for customers through “customizing [sic] products and services, [...] building a unique brand image, tailoring marketing to a specific audience and developing a strong one-to-one connection with a community of customers’’_ [[612]](#_ftn612). As far as users of the Instagram service are concerned, there are network effects at play which leads to incentives to join - or not leave - the platform, so as not to be excluded from participating in discussions, corresponding with and receiving information from others[[613]](#_ftn613).\n\n362.      According to the DE, FR, and IT SAs, the proposed fine is not consistent with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited\n\nfor the same transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR)[[614]](#_ftn614). In particular, the DE SAs point out that ‘_’the facts and the seriousness of the infringements in the two cases are no sufficiently different to justify a difference of 85% in the fine imposed’’_ [[615]](#_ftn615). The FR and IT SAs also compare with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR)[[616]](#_ftn616). While the EDPB agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR[[617]](#_ftn617), the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the DE, FR and IT SAs do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regards to the nature and gravity of the infringements involved[[618]](#_ftn618). Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter.\n\n363.      The DE, FR, IT and NO SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine range is about 0.03 %[[619]](#_ftn619) of the global annual turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc., which the DE SAs note is about 0.72% of the maximum ceiling provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR[[620]](#_ftn620).  For illustrative purposes also, is the amount of time it would take Meta Platforms, Inc. on average to generate 23 million euros in turnover in 2020, which was about 2 hours and 33 minutes[[621]](#_ftn621).\n\n364.      The EDPB agrees with the objections raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed for the transparency infringements - there would be no sufficient special preventive effect towards the controller, nor a credible general preventive effect[[622]](#_ftn622). The proposed fine amount, even where a final amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of doing business691. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model[[623]](#_ftn623), the risk of this occurring is all the greater693. By bearing the cost of the administrative fine, the undertaking can avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future losses that would follow from the adjustment. \n\n365.      Though the IE SA touches upon the notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in relation to the proposed fine[[624]](#_ftn624), there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to explain the modest fine range chosen. Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR[[625]](#_ftn625), the IE SA does not articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness[[626]](#_ftn626). In this regard the EDPB recalls that, contrary to Meta IE’s views[[627]](#_ftn627), the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR[[628]](#_ftn628). The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine. \n\n366.      In light of the above, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.\n\n## 9.2 On the determination of an administrative fine for further infringements  \n\n###            9.2.1    Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision\n\n367.      The IE SA in the Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to deliver its service as outlined in the Instagram Terms of Use and is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so (Finding 1)[[629]](#_ftn629). Alongside, the IE SA concludes that Meta IE can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to carry out the personal data processing activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service (Finding 2)[[630]](#_ftn630). In these terms, the IE SA did not propose to establish an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\n368.      In addition, no infringement of Article 9(1) GDPR has been found as the IE SA has not identified and separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data by Meta IE in the context of Instagram Terms of Use.\n\n369.      The IE SA in its Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has infringed Article 5(1)(a), Article 13(1)(c) and Article 12(1) GDPR due to the lack of transparency in relation to the processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has been relied on (Finding 3)[[631]](#_ftn631).  \n\n### 9.2.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs\n\n370. The AT, DE, FR, IT,  NO, and SE SAs[[632]](#_ftn632) object to the LSA’s failure to take action with respect to one or more specific infringements they deem should have been found and ask the IE SA to impose **a higher administrative fine as a result of these additional infringements.**  \n\n##### Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR\n\n371.      The DE and FR SAs ask for the administrative fine to be increased[[633]](#_ftn633) as a consequence of the proposed finding of an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR[[634]](#_ftn634). The AT, NO and SE SAs argue that the fine should be increased following the finding of an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 705.   \n\n372.      The DE SAs state that the fact that Article 6(1) GDPR was infringed is not properly reflected in the calculation of the fine in the Draft Decision[[635]](#_ftn635). The DE SAs argue that in the current case the processing of personal data was performed without a legal basis as consent of the data subjects would be required, which was not given, and that the “_Draft Decision is insofar not in compliance with Article 83 GDPR as it does not consider the additional infringement of Articles 5(1)(a), Art. 6(1), 9(1) when calculating the amount of the administrative fine_”[[636]](#_ftn636). The DE SAs state that it is a highly serious infringement under Article 83(2)(a) GDPR considering that personal data of at least  individuals were affected708. The DE SAs also highlight that the fine imposed needs to aim to prevent further infringements of the GDPR; first, it should have “_special preventive_” effects, meaning that the amount imposed needs to be such that “_it is not to be expected that the specific controller will commit similar infringements again_” by having “_such a noticeable impact on the profits of the undertaking that future infringements of data protection law would not be ‘discounted’ into the processing performed_\n\n_by the undertaking lightly_”; secondly, it should have _‘’general preventive”_ effects by leading other controllers to “_make a significant effort to avoid similar violations_”[[637]](#_ftn637). \n\n373.      The FR SA considers that some violations are wrongly not included in the Draft Decision[[638]](#_ftn638) and argues that “_since it considers that breach of Articles 6 has been committed, which is added to the other breaches found by the Irish data protection authority, the amount proposed by the latter should be accordingly increased_” [[639]](#_ftn639). The FR SA recalls that the same approach of cumulating the amounts of the fine has been adopted by the EDPB in points 324 to 327 of its Binding Decision 1/2021[[640]](#_ftn640).\n\n374.      On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs explain that the shortcoming of the Draft Decision would cause significant risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, “_because an effective enforcement  of the GDPR, which  is the precondition for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, cannot be ensured_’’ [[641]](#_ftn641).  The DE SAs also point out that administrative fines shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and both special and general preventive since these two “_concepts aim to protect the fundamental rights and freedom of the data subjects by preventing further infringements of the GDPR_”714. Moreover, the DE SAs raise that “_the non-compliance with one of the central provisions of the GDPR would not have any negative financial impact on the undertaking and therefore, from an economical point of a view could be a reasonable option for controllers’’_ [[642]](#_ftn642). The FR SA considers that adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision as it stands “_presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in accordance with Article 4(24) of the GDPR_”[[643]](#_ftn643) and “_would lead to a levelling down of the level of administrative fines imposed by European data protection authorities, thereby reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure effective compliance with the protection of the personal data of European residents_”[[644]](#_ftn644). \n\n***\n\n375.      The AT, NO and SE SAs, which considered that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[645]](#_ftn645), ask for the administrative fine to be increased as a consequence of that infringement. \n\n376.      The AT SA argues that “_the additional infringement_ [of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] _is not properly reflected in the envisaged amount of the administrative fine_” and that the IE SA’s Draft Decision is not in compliance with Article 83 GDPR insofar as it does not consider the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR when calculating the amount of the administrative fine719. \n\n377.      The NO SA states that an administrative fine should be imposed for Meta IE’s processing of personal data in the context of online behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis[[646]](#_ftn646). The NO SA analyses several of the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR in order to prove the need of the imposition of an administrative fine[[647]](#_ftn647). Specifically, the NO SA argues that an administrative fine of a substantial amount is needed, in light of the nature and gravity of the infringement (given that “_the principle of lawfulness [...] is a fundamental pillar of the GDPR_” and “_processing personal data without a legal basis is a clear violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection because no one should have to tolerate processing of their personal data save for when it is legitimised by the legislators_”[[648]](#_ftn648)), as well as the scope of the processing (“_wide_”, as ‘_’all data subject activity may potentially be used for OBA purposes_”), the number of data subjects affected in the EEA (“_hundreds of millions_”) and the intangible damage suffered by them (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR), the high  level of responsibility of Meta IE (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR), the categories of personal data involved (“_of a very personal and private nature_”, able to “_reveal intimate details of the data subjects’ lifestyle, mindset, preferences, psychological wellbeing et cetera_”) (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR) and an additional aggravating factor (high likelihood of contribution to development of ‘_’targeting algorithms which may be harmful on an individual and societal level’’_, Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)[[649]](#_ftn649). \n\n378.      The SE SA argues that “_the Draft Decision is not in compliance with Article 83 insofar as the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) is not considered in calculating the administrative fine_” and that “_an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR cannot be regarded as ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’_ _when the provision that the processing is based on, namely Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, was infringed and when this infringement is not properly reflected in the envisaged amount of the administrative fine_”[[650]](#_ftn650). The SE SA takes the view that that the intentional character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) and the financial benefits gained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) must be found as aggravating factors[[651]](#_ftn651). As to intentionality, the SE SA argues that the switch from consent to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in 2018 suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights afforded to users by the GDPR when the processing relies upon consent, and that in any way the infringement needs to be considered as intentional at least as of the moment of adoption of the EDPB Guidelines on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR which “_clearly gives doubt to the legality of the processing_”[[652]](#_ftn652). As to the financial benefits gained, the SE SA argues “_Meta Ireland has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social media platform service_” and that due to the unclear information provided to data subjects it can be reasonably assumed that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to the processing[[653]](#_ftn653). Lastly, the SE SA considers it would be appropriate to take into account Meta IE’s turnover for the calculation of the fine in order to make it effective and dissuasive[[654]](#_ftn654).\n\n379.      On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT SA argues that “_should the Draft Decision be approved in its current version, the risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects lie in the fact that the action envisaged in relation to the controller is likely to fall short of the proportionality and – above all – dissuasiveness requirements set forth in Article 83 GDPR_” and that “_ignoring infringements of the GDPR when calculating fines would lead to lesser compliance with the GDPR and ultimately to lesser protection of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data_”[[655]](#_ftn655). The NO SA explains that not imposing a fine for the lack of legal basis creates the risk that the violated provisions are not respected by Meta IE or other controllers and the LSA would not be able to effectively safeguard the data subjects’ rights, and that “_in absence of corrective measures that create the appropriate incentives for_ [Meta IE] _and other controllers to change their behaviour, the same or similar violations are likely to reoccur to the detriment of the complainant and other data subjects_” [[656]](#_ftn656). The SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR “_is not properly reflected in the envisaged amount of the administrative fine, it shows controllers (Meta Ireland included) that enforcement of the GDPR and its provisions is not effective. This threatens compliance with the GDPR on a general level, seeing as how non-compliance could be a viable option for controllers when the costs for compliance are greater. Given the proposed changed findings regarding legal basis, there are significant risks to the fundamental rights of data subjects if these does not also merits a substantive increase in fines to dissuade Meta Ireland and other controllers_”[[657]](#_ftn657). \n\n##### Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 9 GDPR\n\n380.      The DE and FR SAs argue that, as the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use and that Meta IE processes the entire amount of data it holds, including special categories of data in breach of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR[[658]](#_ftn658), the amount of the fine should be increased accordingly[[659]](#_ftn659). \n\n381.      The DE SAs state that “_the infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 6(1) and Article 9(1) GDPR [...] also entails an administrative measure and a fine according to Art. 83(2)(5) GDPR_”[[660]](#_ftn660), and argue that these infringements are “_serious_”[[661]](#_ftn661). The FR SA considers that a breach of Article 9 GDPR is wrongly not included in the Draft Decision[[662]](#_ftn662) and that the amount of the fine proposed by the LSA should be increased in light of the addition of such infringements to those already established[[663]](#_ftn663). The FR SA recalls that the same approach of cumulating the amounts of the fine has been adopted by the EDPB in points 324 to 327 of the Binding Decision 1/2021738. \n\n382.      On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs explain that the shortcoming of the Draft Decision would cause significant risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, “_because an effective enforcement  of the GDPR, which  is the precondition for the protection of the fundamental_\n\n_rights and freedoms of the data subjects, cannot be ensured_’’ [[664]](#_ftn664).  The DE SAs also point out that administrative fines shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and both special and general preventive since these two “_concepts aim to protect the fundamental rights and freedom of the data subjects by preventing further infringements of the GDPR_”[[665]](#_ftn665). Moreover, the DE SA raises that “_the non-compliance with one of the central provisions of the GDPR would not have any negative financial impact on the undertaking and therefore, from an economical point of a view could be a reasonable option for controllers_’’ [[666]](#_ftn666). The FR SA considers that adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision as it stands “_presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in accordance with Article 4(24) of the GDPR_”[[667]](#_ftn667) and “_would lead to a levelling down of the level of administrative fines imposed by European data protection authorities, thereby reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure effective compliance with the protection of the personal data of European residents_”743. \n\n##### Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b)-(c) GDPR\n\n383.      The IT SA argues that the fine should be increased following the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR[[668]](#_ftn668), and of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR [[669]](#_ftn669). As stated in Section 6.2 of this Binding Decision, the IT SA agrees to a large extent with the Draft Decision’s Finding 3 on the infringement of Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency746 but it argues that Meta IE has also failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, which, in the view of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically to transparency747. Moreover, as analysed in Section 7.2, the IT SA states that there is an additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on account of Meta IE’s failure to comply with the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles748. The IT SA asks for a fine to be issued for those two additional infringements. With regard to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the IT SA argues that the finding of such infringement “_should result into the imposition of  the relevant administrative fine as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR”_ as far as _“the infringement of the fairness principle  in addition to the transparency one [...]  should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive. Indeed, the gravity of the infringement would be factually compounded”[**[670]**](#_ftn670)._ With reference to Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the IT SA considers that “_the infringement of purpose limitation and data minimisation principles_ (...) _should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive. Indeed, the gravity of the infringement would be factually compounded”750_.\n\n384.      On the significance of risks posed by the Draft Decision, the IT SA argues that “_the failure to find an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as for the fairness principle may become a dangerous precedent with a view to future decisions concerning other digital platform operators – more generally, other controllers that rely on the same business model – and markedly weaken the safeguards to be provided by way of the effective, comprehensive implementation of the data protection framework including the fairness of processing principle_” [[671]](#_ftn671). With reference to Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the IT SA adds that, should the Draft Decision be approved in its current version, the infringement of two key principles of the whole data protection framework as introduced by the GDPR will not be punished, “_which would seriously jeopardise the safeguards the data subjects (Instagram users) are entitled to_”[[672]](#_ftn672). \n\n### 9.2.3 Position of the LSA on the objections\n\n385. The LSA considers none of the objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the proposed additional infringements as meeting the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR[[673]](#_ftn673). Given that these objections were premised upon the requirement for the Draft Decision to include findings of infringement of Article 6(1)(b), Article 9, Article 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) GDPR, on which the IE SA expressed its disagreement – the IE SA does not consider the objections requesting exercise of a corrective power in response to these findings of infringement as being relevant and reasoned.\n\n### 9.2.4 Analysis of the EDPB\n\n#####            9.2.4.1          Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned\n\n386.      The objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, IT, NO, and SE SAs concern “_whether the action envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR_”[[674]](#_ftn674).  \n\n387.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR [[675]](#_ftn675).  Meta IE rejects the objections in this section based on its view that the LSA has sole discretion to determine corrective measures[[676]](#_ftn676). The EDPB responds to these arguments above (see Section 8.4.2) and is of the view that CSAs may ask for specific corrective measures to be taken by the LSA, whether this concerns infringements already identified in the Draft Decision or as a result of the one identified by the CSA in its objection[[677]](#_ftn677). Meta IE refutes the allegations of additional infringements put forward in the objections, and by consequence, any demands for increasing the administrative fine in relation them[[678]](#_ftn678). The EDPB recalls that the assessment of admissibility of objections and the assessment of the merits are two distinct steps[[679]](#_ftn679). \n\n388.      The EDPB finds that the objections concerning the increase of the administrative fine in connection with the additional infringement of Article 6(1)/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR raised by the AT,\n\nDE, FR, NO, and SE SAs stand in direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, as they concern the imposition of a corrective measure for an additional infringement, which would be found as a consequence of reversing the conclusions in the Draft Decision also in scope of this dispute[[680]](#_ftn680). Clearly, the decision on the merits of the demands to take corrective measures for a proposed additional infringement is affected by the EDPB’s decision on whether to reverse the findings in the Draft Decision and whether to instruct the LSA to establish additional infringements. \n\n389.      The EDPB takes note of further arguments put forward by Meta IE aiming to demonstrate the lack of relevance of these objections, specifically with regard to the objections raised by the AT SA[[681]](#_ftn681). However, the EDPB notes that Meta IE disagrees with the content of these objections, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility. \n\n390.      If followed, these objections would lead to a different conclusion in terms of corrective measures imposed[[682]](#_ftn682). In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in connection to imposing an administrative fine for the alleged breach of Article 6(1)/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR to be **relevant**.\n\n391.      Meta IE argues that the AT, NO, and SE SAs objections in relation to the need to increase the fine amount because of the alleged infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR lacks adequate reasoning as they fail to demonstrate why Meta IE could not rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[683]](#_ftn683). According to Meta IE, the SE SA’s objection is also based on the unfounded claim that Meta IE intentionally sought to circumvent data subject rights by switching from consent to contractual necessity as the legal basis in May 2018[[684]](#_ftn684). Furthermore, Meta IE takes the view that the objections from the AT, DE, FR and NO SAs are not sufficiently reasoned as they refer to the use of administrative fine as ''_general preventive measures''_ on controllers, thus speculating on potential future behaviour or intentions of unidentified controllers[[685]](#_ftn685). The EDPB understands that Meta IE disagrees with the reasoning provided in the objections, which thus concerns their merits and not their admissibility. \n\n392.      In addition, Meta IE argues that the FR SA’s objection is not reasoned because it does not substantiate “_how a fine for the additional purported infringements would be calculated, whether this fine would need to be added to the proposed fine and how this would affect the overall fine_”[[686]](#_ftn686). Meta IE further takes issue with the AT SA’s objection and argues it has not put forward a sufficiently reasoned basis for its objection to challenge the LSA’s calculation of the criteria laid down in Article 83(2) GDPR[[687]](#_ftn687).  In this respect, the EDPB recalls that CSAs are not required to engage in a full assessment of all the aspects of Article 83 GDPR in order for an objection on the appropriate administrative fine to be considered reasoned. It is sufficient to lay out which aspect of the Draft Decision that, in their view, is deficient/erroneous and why. Second, the EDPB recalls that the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR are not exhaustive, thus it is entirely possible to argue an administrative fine is not “_effective, proportionate and dissuasive_” in the meaning of Article 83(1) GDPR without referring to a specific criterion listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.\n\n393.      The EDPB finds that the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs adequately argue why they propose amending the Draft Decision[[688]](#_ftn688) and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed [[689]](#_ftn689).\n\n394.      In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk to fundamental rights, and argues the objections of the AT, DE ,FR, NO and SE SAs[[690]](#_ftn690) fail to demonstrate the contrary, as required.\n\n395.      More specifically, Meta IE considers that the DE and FR SAs’ objections focus on increasing the ‘_’punitive impact’’_ of the fine on Meta IE rather than demonstrating any significant risks to the fundamental rights of data subjects[[691]](#_ftn691). In this regard, Meta IE argues the AT, DE, NO, and SE SAs’ objections rest on unsubstantiated possible effect of the Draft Decision on the future behaviour of other controllers, instead of doing a case by case assessment under Article 83 GDPR [[692]](#_ftn692). In particular, Meta IE claims that, in doing so, the assessment made by these supervisory authorities is incorrect to the extent it only takes into account financial costs and does not consider reputational costs[[693]](#_ftn693). \n\n396.      The EDPB recalls that any risk assessment addresses future outcomes which are to some degree uncertain[[694]](#_ftn694). Contrary to Meta IE’s views, the objections reflect specifically on Meta IE’s future approach in the event the Draft Decision is adopted as it stands and go beyond providing “_speculative argument based on the putative lack of a general preventive impact on other controllers”_ [[695]](#_ftn695).  The EDPB also notes that the DE, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs[[696]](#_ftn696) considered both of the aspects that are entailed by dissuasiveness of the fine, i.e. specific deterrence and general deterrence[[697]](#_ftn697).  \n\n397.      The EDPB finds that the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs articulate an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals 778.  \n\n398.      Therefore, the EDPB considers the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs objections concerning the imposition of a fine for the alleged additional infringements of Article 6/6(1)(b) and/or Article 9 GDPR to be **reasoned**.\n\n***\n\n399.      With respect to the objection raised by the IT SA concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB finds, contrary to Meta IE’s views779,  that it stands in connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, as it concerns the imposition of a corrective measure for an additional infringement, which would be found as a consequence of incorporating the finding put forward by the objection. Clearly, the decision on the merits of the demand to take corrective measures for a proposed additional infringement is affected by the EDPB’s decision on whether to instruct the LSA to include an additional infringement.\n\n400.      If followed, the IT SA’s objection would lead to a different conclusion in terms of corrective measures imposed 780. Taking note of Meta IE’s position781, the EDPB finds the objections raised by the IT SA to be **relevant**.\n\n401.      Meta IE argues the IT SA’s objection does not put forward reasonable doubt as to the validity of the LSA’s calculation of the fine and claims there is no basis in the GDPR for suggesting that an administrative fine must have a ‘_’general deterrent effect_’’782.The EDPB finds that the IT SA adequately argues why they propose amending the Draft Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed783.\n\ninfringement again) and general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future). See, _inter alia,_ C-511/11, Versalis, paragraph 94.  \n\n778  AT SA Objection, p. 11-12; DE SAs Objection, p. 12; FR SA Objection, paragraphs 47-48; NO SA Objection, p. 12;  SE SA Objection, p. 5. See also EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 37. \n\n779  Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.13. According to Meta IE, the IT SA objections is not relevant given that the LSA has not found any infringement of the fairness, purpose limitation and data minimisation principles (Article 5(1)(a)-(c) GDPR). \n\n780  IT SA Objection, p. 7. \n\n781  Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.13. According to Meta IE, given the IE SA has not found any infringement of the fairness principle, there is no basis for the imposition of a fine on this ground. EDPB already responded to this line of reasoning above in Section 8.4.2.\n\n782  Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 7.15-16.\n\n783  The IT SA argues that the finding of such infringement “_should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive’’_ insofar as _‘’the gravity of the infringement would be factually compounded._” (IT SA Objection, pp. 6-7). \n\n402.      Meta IE argues the objection of the IT SA fails to demonstrate the risk posed by the Draft Decision, as required [[698]](#_ftn698) and, in doing so, Meta IE dismisses the concerns articulated by the IT SA on the precedent the Draft Decision sets for other controllers[[699]](#_ftn699). \n\n403.      The EDPB finds that the IT SA articulates an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals[[700]](#_ftn700).  \n\n404.      Therefore, the EDPB considers the IT SA’s objection concerning the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be **reasoned**.\n\n***\n\n405.      The EDPB recalls its analysis of whether the objection raised by the IT SA in respect of the proposed additional infringements of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR meets the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR (see Section 7.4.1 above). In light of the conclusion that such objection is not relevant and reasoned, the EDPB does not need to further examine this linked objection.    \n\n#####            9.2.4.2    Assessment on the merits\n\n406.      In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a Binding Decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. More specifically, the EDPB needs to assess whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the additional infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR and the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. However, in light of its findings in Section 5.4.2 above, the EDPB does not need to examine the merits of the objections of the DE and FR SAs requesting the imposition of a fine for the alleged additional breach of Article 9 GDPR.\n\n407.      The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines [[701]](#_ftn701) and that the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules or to punish unlawful behaviour (or both)[[702]](#_ftn702). The EDPB responds above to Meta IE’s position that the LSA has sole discretion to determine which corrective measures are appropriate (see Section 8.4.2).\n\n_9.2.4.2.1_ _Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of_\n\n_Article 6(1) GDPR_ \n\n408.      The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR [[703]](#_ftn703) and that the objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs found to be relevant and reasoned requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose an administrative fine [[704]](#_ftn704). \n\n409.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that, even if an infringement is found, the appropriate course would be to refer the matter back to the LSA to determine whether to impose any appropriate corrective measures[[705]](#_ftn705), and that the LSA has sole competence and discretion regarding the amount of the fine[[706]](#_ftn706). The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s argument that the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above in Section 8.4.2.   \n\n410.      The EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-bycase basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one[[707]](#_ftn707). In the case at hand, however, the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in their objections. The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection [[708]](#_ftn708). \n\n411.      Several of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. \n\n##### The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)\n\n412.      As mentioned above and outlined below[[709]](#_ftn709), the **nature and gravity of the infringement** clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine. \n\n413.      With respect to the **scope of processing**, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that _“Meta Ireland processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a ‘personalised’ experience, including by way of serving personalised advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered_ [...]_’’ 796_. \n\n414.      In this respect, the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal data of a significant **number of people** [[710]](#_ftn710) and that the impact on them has to be considered.  \n\n415.      Though the **damage** is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that data subjects have been faced with data processing that should not have occurred (by relying inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis as established in Section 4.4.2). The data processing in question - behavioural advertising - entails decisions about information that data subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “_where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data_”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, a risk of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself. \n\n##### The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)\n\n416.      The SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be considered intentional on Meta IE’s part, which is an aggravating factor [[711]](#_ftn711). \n\n417.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the aim to infringe the GDPR, nor was negligent - but “_has relied on what it has consistently considered in good faith to be a valid legal basis for the purpose of processing of personal data for behavioural advertising and which now requires escalation to the EDPB for resolution”_[[712]](#_ftn712). Before addressing each of the elements of this claim, the EDPB first notes that establishing either intent or negligence is not a requirement for imposing a fine, but deserves “_due regard_”. Second, contrary to what Meta IE implies, the mere circumstance that a dispute between the LSA and the CSAs has escalated to the EDPB does not serve as evidence that a controller acted in good faith with respect to the disputed issues. First, the dispute arises only (long) after the controller has decided on its course of action, and therefore cannot inform it. Second, a dispute may simply bring to light that an LSA has decided to challenge a position commonly held by (a majority of) the CSAs.  \n\n418.      The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the willfulness in relation to such act[[713]](#_ftn713). By contrast, an infringement is “_unintentional_” when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement. \n\n419.      The characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis of objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case[[714]](#_ftn714). It is worth noting the broader approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain degree of knowledge about a potential infringement[[715]](#_ftn715). This provides an indication that noncompliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence.\n\n420.      The SE SA argues that Meta IE “_has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the aforementioned [EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] – which clearly gives doubt to the legality of the processing – which were first adopted on 9 April 2019 and made final on 8 October 2019. The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date_”[[716]](#_ftn716). \n\n421.      The EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive - is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application. Second, WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “_the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract_”[[717]](#_ftn717).\n\n422.      It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement intentional, as stated above, since the “_aim_” or “_wilfulness_” of the action should be demonstrated.  \n\n423.      The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the “_will_” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the “_wilfulness_” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality[[718]](#_ftn718). While it may prove difficult to _demonstrate_ a subjective element such as the “_will_” to act in a certain manner, there need to be some objective elements that _indicate_ the existence of such intentionality806. \n\n424.      The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “_serious negligence_”, rather than “_intentionality_” when “_the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation”_[[719]](#_ftn719). In this regard, while the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place for the safeguard of personal data[[720]](#_ftn720), this does not, however, per se change the nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional. \n\n425.      In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that _“_[the] _proposed finding of infringement concerning information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, since it goes to show that Meta Ireland was aware of the questionable legality of that basis and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects_”[[721]](#_ftn721).  \n\n426.      The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Instagram Terms of Use as an objective element, however this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations. In the EDPB’s view, the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient to indicate intention either. \n\n427.      Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE to act in breach of the law as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its legal obligations.\n\n428.      Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SA do not meet the threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element. \n\n429.      At the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR[[722]](#_ftn722).  \n\n430.      The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “_good faith_”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, following the adoption of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests (see paragraph 421 of this Binding Decision), which means Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, given the fact\n\nthat processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation. \n\n##### The degree of responsibility of the controller taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR)\n\n431. The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regards to the transparency infringements[[723]](#_ftn723).\n\n##### The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)\n\n432.      The SE SA argues Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract as legal basis for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Instagram[[724]](#_ftn724). While not providing an estimate of its size, the SE SA considers the existence of financial benefit sufficiently proven on the basis of “_the self-evident fact that Meta Ireland has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social media platform service, as opposed to establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear in the information to data subjects, it is a reasonable assumption that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to the processing, thus increasing the financial benefits gained by Meta Ireland pursuant to personal advertisement_” [[725]](#_ftn725). \n\n433.      As explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from the infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. The aim of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR is to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case[[726]](#_ftn726). \n\n434.      In particular, in view of ensuring fines that are effective, proportionate and deterrent, and in light of common accepted practice in the field of EU competition law[[727]](#_ftn727), which inspired the fining framework under the GDPR, the EDPB is of the view that, when calculating the administrative fine, supervisory authorities could take account of the financial benefits obtained from the infringement, in order to impose a fine that aim at “_counterbalancing the gains from the infringement_”[[728]](#_ftn728).\n\n435.      When applying this provision, the supervisory authorities must _“assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified”_[[729]](#_ftn729). Therefore, financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR [[730]](#_ftn730).\n\n436.      In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement. \n\n437.      Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.  \n\n##### Competitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)\n\n438.      The NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “_that the unlawful processing of personal data in all likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual or societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to_ [Meta IE]. _The algorithms may have contributed to giving_ [Meta IE] _a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors_”[[731]](#_ftn731).\n\n439.      On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR[[732]](#_ftn732). In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.\n\n***\n\n440.      Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency infringements relating to processing carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR[[733]](#_ftn733). The EDPB underlines that, in order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, a fine should reflect the circumstances of the case. Such circumstances not only refer to the specific elements of the infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely its financial position.\n\n_9.2.4.2.2_ _Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR_ \n\n441.      The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR[[734]](#_ftn734) and that the objection raised by the IT SA, which was found to\n\nbe relevant and reasoned, requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose an administrative fine[[735]](#_ftn735).\n\n442.      The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that it would not be appropriate for the EDPB to instruct the LSA to take corrective measures in relation to the additional infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR considering that this issue does not fall within the scope of the Inquiry. The EDPB responds to these arguments above in Section 6.4.2[[736]](#_ftn736).   \n\n443.      The EDPB recalls that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-bycase basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one[[737]](#_ftn737). In the same vein, the EDPB’s assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness is carried out by taking into account the specificities of the case, of the particular social networking service at hand and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising [[738]](#_ftn738). \n\n444.      As previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent meaning[[739]](#_ftn739). It underpins the whole data protection framework and plays a key role for securing a balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship828.\n\n445.      Considering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6.4.2 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements of the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects as to the processing of their personal data, fulfilling data subjects’ reasonable expectation, ensuring power balance, avoiding deception and ensuring ethical and truthful processing, as well as the overall effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR, the EDPB reiterates its view that Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into account by the IE SA in the calculation of the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed following the conclusion of this inquiry.\n\n446.      Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when re-assessing the administrative fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR. \n\n# 10 BINDING DECISION\n\n447.      In light of the above, and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue binding decisions pursuant to Article 65 GDPR, the EDPB issues the following Binding Decision in accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.\n\n448.      The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, in accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR. \n\n_On the objections concerning whether the LSA should have found an infringement for lack of appropriate legal basis_\n\n449.      The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU , NL, NO, and SE SAs regarding Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Instagram Terms of Use meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n450.      On the parts of the DE SAs’ objection requesting the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and the parts of the DE and NO SAs objections requesting specific corrective measures under Article 58 GDPR for the infringement of Article 6(1) or 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely the imposition of an administrative fine, a ban of the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and an order to identify a valid legal basis for future behavioural advertising or to abstain from such processing activities, the EDPB decides that these parts of their objections do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. Similarly, the part of the FI SA objection concerning the imposition of a specific corrective measures, namely an administrative fine is not reasoned and does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n451.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Instagram Terms of Use, and to include an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified in this Binding Decision.\n\n_On the objections concerning whether the LSA’s Draft Decision includes sufficient analysis and evidence to conclude that Meta IE is not obliged to rely on consent to process the Complainant’s personal data_\n\n452.      The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FI, FR, and NL  SAs regarding the LSA’s Finding 1 that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n453.      On the part of the NL SA objection asking the IE SA to include in its Draft Decision the elements concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices under ePrivacy legislation, the EDPB decides that this part falls outside the scope of the EDPB’s mandate. The objection raised by the ES SA regarding the potential infringement of Article 9 GDPR is not sufficiently reasoned and, therefore, the EDPB decides that the objection of the ES SA does not meet the threshold provided for by Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n454.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its Instagram service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and complies with the relevant obligations under the GDPR to the extent that the investigation complements the findings made in the IE SA’s Final Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding Decision; and, based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft decision in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR.\n\n_On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness_ \n\n455.      The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the infringement by Meta IE of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n456.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision an additional infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE.\n\n_On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation_\n\n457.      On the objection by the IT SA concerning the possible additional infringements of the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the EDPB decides this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n_On the objections concerning corrective measures other than administrative fines_\n\n458.      The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional and/or alternative specific corrective measures to be imposed meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n459.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of the Instagram service into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months.\n\n460.      The EDPB also instructs the LSA to adjust its order to Meta IE to bring Instagram Data Policy and Terms of Use into compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months, to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also to data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of Instagram service (to reflect the finding of the EDPB that for this processing the controller cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).  \n\n_On the objections concerning the determination of the administrative fine for the transparency infringements_\n\n461.      The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs regarding the determination of the administrative fine for the transparency infringements, meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.\n\n462.      The EDPB considers that the Final Decision does not need to refer to the infringements by WhatsApp Ireland Limited, as established in Decision IN-18-12-2, as an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(e) GDPR for the calculation of the fine.\n\n463.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine, as appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. \n\n464.      The EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine. \n\n_On the objections concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis_\n\n465.      The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. \n\n466.      In relation to intentionality under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SA in their objection do not contain sufficient objective elements to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. \n\n467.      Regarding the possible financial benefit obtained from the infringement as well as the competitive advantage (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB instructs the IE SA to ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as further estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed. \n\n468.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to cover the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR with an administrative fine which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. In determining the fine amount, the IE SA must give due regard to all the applicable factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR, in particular the nature and gravity of the infringement, the number of data subjects affected and the seriously negligent character of the infringement.\n\n_On the objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR_\n\n469.      The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. \n\n470.      The EDPB instructs the IE SA to factor the additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR into its adoption of appropriate corrective measures. In this respect, the IE SA is instructed to take due account of this infringement when re-assessing the administrative fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.  \n\n_On the objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR_\n\n471.      The EDPB decides that it does not need to examine the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.\n\n# 11 FINAL REMARKS\n\n472.      This Binding Decision is addressed to the IE SA and the CSAs. The IE SA shall adopt its final decision on the basis of this Binding Decision pursuant to Article 65(6) GDPR.\n\n473.      Regarding the objections deemed not to meet the requirements stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised therein. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.\n\n474.      According to Article 65(6) GDPR, the IE SA shall adopt its final decision on the basis of the Binding Decision without undue delay and at the latest by one month after the Board has notified its Binding Decision. \n\n475.      The IE SA shall inform the Board of the date when its final decision is notified to the controller or the processor[[740]](#_ftn740). This Binding Decision will be made public pursuant to Article 65(5) GDPR without delay after the IE SA has notified its final decision to the controller[[741]](#_ftn741).\n\n476.      The IE SA will communicate its final decision to the Board831. Pursuant to Article 70(1)(y) GDPR, the IE SA’s final decision communicated to the EDPB will be included in the register of decisions which have been subject to the consistency mechanism.\n\nFor the European Data Protection Board\n\nThe Chair\n\n(Andrea Jelinek)\n\n  \n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1.\n\n[[2]](#_ftnref2) References to “Member States” made throughout this decision should be understood as references to “EEA Member States”.\n\n[[3]](#_ftnref3) EDPB Rules of Procedure, adopted on 25 May 2018.\n\n[[4]](#_ftnref4) Objections raised on behalf of the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Brandenburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the  State Commissioner for Data Protection in Lower Saxony and the State Commissioner for Data Protection North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n[[5]](#_ftnref5) Complaint, paragraphs 2.2.5. and 2.3.2.\n\n[[6]](#_ftnref6) Within its request to investigate in paragraph 3.1 of the Complaint, the Complainant requested that a full investigation be made to determine _“which processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the data subject_”, _“for which purpose they are performed”, “on which legal basis for each specific processing operation the controller relies on”,_ and to acquire _“a copy of any records of processing activities”._ The complaint also _requested “that the results of this investigation_ [be] made available to [them]”.

Meta IE refers to the EDPB’s Binding Decision 2/2022 and specifically to the paragraphs where the EDPB established that specific objections raised by the DE SAs and NO SA in that case were not relevant and reasoned. There are several differences between those objections and the objections which are analysed in this section. \n\nMore specifically, in the Binding Decision 2/2022 the objections referred to by Meta IE did not “_establish a direct connection with the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision_” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs 139, 147, 164) whereas each CSA here has made several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, as is described in paragraph 77 of this Binding Decision.\n\n[[110]](#_ftnref110) Meta IE does not consider that any of the objections are reasoned, as set out in their replies to each of the objections in Annex 1. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, pp. 66 - 124. In respect of Meta IE’s arguments in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 Submissions on these objections not being reasoned, the EDPB notes that the objections that were found to be not relevant and/or not reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 did “_not provide sufficiently precise and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in question_”, did not explain sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion proposed could be reached, or did not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 140, 148, 165). Here, each CSA provides a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations as to why an infringement for lack of appropriate legal basis is to be established, and adequately identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision if it was adopted unchanged (paragraphs 79-81 of this Binding Decision).\n\n[[111]](#_ftnref111) “_For instance, if the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised by the complainant or resulting from an infringement reported by a CSA, a relevant and reasoned objection may be raised based on the failure of the LSA to properly handle the complaint and to safeguard the rights of the data subject_.” EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph. 27. 120 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.2.\n\n[[112]](#_ftnref112) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.10, where Meta IE makes reference to paragraphs 32-33 of the Composite Response.\n\n[[113]](#_ftnref113) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.10.\n\n[[114]](#_ftnref114) The EDPB fails to see how, for instance, declaring an objection admissible but rejecting it on merits could impinge on the procedural rights of the controller involved in the underlying case. \n\n[[115]](#_ftnref115) AT SA Objection, pp. 4-5; DE SAs Objection, p. 5-6, ES SA Objection, p. 2, FI SA Objection, paragraphs 16 and 18, FR SA Objection, paragraphs 8-9, HU SA Objection, p. 3, NL SA Objection, paragraphs 18-19; NO SA Objection, p. 7, SE SA Objection, pp. 3.\n\n[[116]](#_ftnref116) DE SAs Objection, pp. 3-4 ; NL SA Objection, paragraphs 7 and 10-12.\n\n[[117]](#_ftnref117) AT SA Objection, p.4; DE SAs Objection pp.5-6 ; FR SA Objection, paragraphs 9-11; NL SA Objection paragraph 18; NO SA Objection, p. 7-8; SE SA Objection, p. 3.

In its submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, Meta IE stated that the correct figure for monthly active accounts for the Instagram Service as of 31 August 2018 (the date of commencement of the Inquiry) is approximately ![](file:///C:/Users/milos/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif), while clarifying that this number represents active accounts on Instagram rather than unique users and thus does not represent the number of unique users. This figure does not include UK-based accounts as Meta IE considered accounts in that territory were not relevant for the Inquiry.

The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See paragraphs 73-75 of this Binding Decision above. In particular, the EDPB recalls that the analysis of whether a given objection meets the threshold set by Art. 4(24) GDPR is carried out on a case-by-case basis. More specifically, in contrast to the objections referred to by Meta IE that did not “_establish a direct connection with the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision_” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs 139, 147, 164) here, each CSA has made several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, as is described in paragraphs 143, 145-147 and 150-151 of this Binding Decision. Moreover, while the objections referenced by Meta IE in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 submissions were found not to be relevant and/or reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 as they did “_not provide sufficiently precise and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in question_”, did not explain sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion proposed could be reached, or did not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision\n\n[[265]](#_ftnref265) /2022, paragraphs 140, 148, 165), as regards the objections analysed in this section, the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs provide a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations as to why an infringement for lack of appropriate legal basis is to be established, and adequately identify the risk posed by the Draft Decision if it was adopted unchanged (paragraphs 145-165 of this Binding Decision) .\n\n[[266]](#_ftnref266) AT SA Objection, p. 9;

Meta IE refers to the EDPB’s Binding Decision 2/2022 and specifically to the paragraphs where the EDPB established that specific objections raised by the DE SAs and NO SA in that case were not relevant and reasoned. There are several differences between those objections and the objection of the IT SA that is being analysed in this section. \n\nMore specifically, in the Binding Decision 2/2022 the objections referred to by Meta IE did not “_establish a direct connection with the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision_” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs\n\n[[360]](#_ftnref360) , 147, 164) whereas the IT SA objection here makes several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, by referring to the analysis carried out by the IE SA in respect of the breach of the transparency obligations and to specific observations made by the LSA and explains how the additional infringement of Art. 5(1)(a) could be established on that basis (see, for example, p. 6 of the IT Objection referring to paragraph 185 of the Draft Decision concerning users being left “_in the dark_”).  396 IT SA Objection, p. 5-6.\n\n[[361]](#_ftnref361) IT SA Objection, p. 1.\n\n[[362]](#_ftnref362) See paragraphs 206-208 of this Binding Decision.\n\n[[363]](#_ftnref363) IT SA Objection, p. 5.\n\n[[364]](#_ftnref364) IT SA Objection, p. 5. \n\n[[365]](#_ftnref365) IT SA Objection, p. 6.\n\n[[366]](#_ftnref366) IT SA Objection, p. 6. See also above, paragraphs 206-208. In respect of Meta IE’s arguments in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 Submissions on this objection not being reasoned, the EDPB notes that the objections that were found to be not relevant and/or not reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 did “_not provide sufficiently precise and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in question_”, did not explain sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion proposed could be reached, or did not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 140, 148, 165). The IT SA objection provides, instead, a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations as to why a breach of the fairness principle is to be established, and adequately identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision if it was adopted unchanged.  403 IT SA Objection, p. 7.\n\n[[367]](#_ftnref367) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraph 7.10.

Meta IE argues that “_The GDPR does not confer any power on the EDPB to consider objections solely challenging the amount of a fine, and the EDPB may not give instructions as to whether a fine ought to be imposed, or as to its amount’_’. \n\n[[564]](#_ftnref564) In this regard, Recital 150 GDPR can be recalled, as it states that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines. Consequently, an objection can challenge the elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine, and if the assessment of the EDPB within this context identifies shortcomings in the reasoning leading to the imposition of the fine at stake, the LSA will be instructed to re-assess the fine and remedy the identified shortcomings (EDPB Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), para 91; EDPB RRO Guidelines, paragraph 34).  The EDPB found several objections on this subject matter admissible in the past, see _inter alia_ Binding Decision 1/2020, paragraphs 175-178 and 180-181, Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraphs 310-314, Binding Decision 1/2022 paragraphs 53-55, Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 186-190. Consequently, within its mission of ensuring a consistent application of the GDPR, the EDPB is fully competent to resolve the dispute arisen among supervisory authorities and remedy the shortcomings in the Draft Decision concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which will in any event be quantified and imposed by the LSA in its national decision adopted on the basis of the EDPB’s binding decision. \n\n[[565]](#_ftnref565) Meta IE argues that these objections are “_a direct criticism of the amount of the DPC’s proposed fine (i.e. an area within the DPC’s sole discretion as LSA) rather than the lawfulness of the DPC’s reliance on the relevant factors to calculate the fine (which would be the Draft Decision’s relevant legal and factual content to which the [CSAs] could object)_’’.

In this regard Meta IE submits that ‘_’a fine proposed by the LSA is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive as long as the criteria laid down in Article 83(2) GDPR are duly taken into account (which is clearly the case here). Indeed, the calculation of fines is subjective, and there is significant variance amongst objecting CSAs as to what the appropriate fine should be_’.\n\n[[568]](#_ftnref568) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.22, 5.19, 7.16, 8.26, and 9.23.\n\n[[569]](#_ftnref569) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.23, 5.18, and 7.17.\n\n[[570]](#_ftnref570) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraph 5.21.\n\n[[571]](#_ftnref571) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraph 9.26.\n\n[[572]](#_ftnref572) DE SAs Objection, p. 11-12; FR SA Objection, paragraphs 38, 40, 42, 43, 47; IT SA Objection, pp. 7-9 ; NL SA Objection, paragraphs 44-45 and 47-50; NO SA Objection, pp. 11-12.\n\n[[573]](#_ftnref573) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.24-2.27, 5.22-5.25, 7.18-7.21, 8.28-8.32, and 9.259.27. \n\n[[574]](#_ftnref574) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.24, 5.22, and 7.18. \n\n[[575]](#_ftnref575) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 8. 28, and 9.25. \n\n[[576]](#_ftnref576) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.25, 5.23, 7.19, 8.30, and 9.26.\n\n[[577]](#_ftnref577) Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.26, 5.24, 7. 20, 8.31.

Pursuant to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, personal data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of a legitimate basis laid down by law. In this regard, Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation[[1]](#_ftn1) (GDPR) specifies that processing shall be lawful only on the basis of one of six specified conditions set out in Article 6(1)(a) to (f). Identifying the appropriate legal basis that corresponds to the objective and essence of the processing is of essential importance. Controllers must, _inter alia,_ take into account the impact on data subjects’ rights when identifying the appropriate lawful basis in order to respect the principle of fairness.\n\n2. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR provides a lawful basis for the processing of personal data to the extent that “processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract_”_.[[2]](#_ftn2) This supports the freedom to conduct a business, which is guaranteed by Article 16 of the Charter, and reflects the fact that sometimes the contractual obligations towards the data subject cannot be performed without the data subject providing certain personal data. If the specific processing is part and parcel of delivery of the requested service, it is in the interests of both parties to process that data, as otherwise the service could not be provided and the contract could not be performed. However, the ability to rely on this or one of the other legal bases mentioned in Article 6(1) does not exempt the controller from compliance with the other requirements of the GDPR.\n\n3. Articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union define and regulate the freedom to provide services within the European Union. Specific EU legislative measures have been adopted in respect of ‘information society services’.[[3]](#_ftn3) These services are defined as “any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services.” This definition extends to services that are not paid for directly by the persons who receive them,[[4]](#_ftn4) such as online services funded through advertising. ‘Online services’ as used in these guidelines refers to ‘information society services’.\n\n4. The development of EU law reflects the central importance of online services in modern society. The proliferation of always-on mobile internet and the widespread availability of connected devices have enabled the development of online services in fields such as social media, e-commerce, internet search, communication, and travel. While some of these services are funded by user payments, others are provided without monetary payment by the consumer, instead financed by the sale of online advertising services allowing for targeting of data subjects. Tracking of user behaviour for the purposes of such advertising is often carried out in ways the user is often not aware of,[[5]](#_ftn5) and it may not be immediately obvious from the nature of the service provided, which makes it almost impossible in practice for the data subject to exercise an informed choice over the use of their data.\n\n5. Against this background, the European Data Protection Board[[6]](#_ftn6) (EDPB) considers it appropriate to provide guidance on the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) to processing of personal data in the context of online services, in order to ensure that this lawful basis is only relied upon where appropriate.\n\n6. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29) has previously expressed views on the contractual necessity basis under Directive 95/46/EC in its opinion on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller.[[7]](#_ftn7)Generally, that guidance remains relevant to Article 6(1)(b) and the GDPR.\n\n## 1.2         Scope of these guidelines\n\n7. These guidelines are concerned with the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) to processing of personal data in the context of contracts for online services, irrespective of how the services are financed. The guidelines will outline the elements of lawful processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and consider the concept of ‘necessity’ as it applies to ’necessary for the performance of a contract’.\n\n8. Data protection rules govern important aspects of how online services interact with their users, however, other rules apply as well. Regulation of online services involves cross-functional responsibilities in the fields of, _inter alia,_ consumer protection law, and competition law. Considerations regarding these fields of law are beyond the scope of these guidelines.\n\n9. Although Article 6(1)(b) can only apply in a contractual context, these guidelines do not express a view on the validity of contracts for online services generally, as this is outside the competence of the EDPB. Nonetheless, contracts and contractual terms must comply with the requirements of contract laws and, as the case may be for consumer contracts, consumer protection laws in order for processing based on those terms to be considered fair and lawful.\n\n10.  Some general observations on data protection principles are included below, but not all data protection issues that may arise when processing under Article 6(1)(b) will be elaborated on. Controllers must always ensure that they comply with the data protection principles set out in Article 5 and all other requirements of the GDPR and, where applicable, the ePrivacy legislation.\n\n# 2         PART 2 - ANALYSIS OF ARTICLE 6(1)(B)\n\n## 2.1         General observations\n\n11.  The lawful basis for processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) needs to be considered in the context of the GDPR as a whole, the objectives set out in Article 1, and alongside controllers’ duty to process personal data in compliance with the data protection principles pursuant to Article 5. This includes processing personal data in a fair and transparent manner and in line with the purpose limitation and data minimisation obligations.\n\n12.  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR provides that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently in relation to the data subject. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations[[8]](#_ftn8) of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller.\n\n13.  As mentioned, as a matter of lawfulness, contracts for online services must be valid under the applicable contract law. An example of a relevant factor is whether the data subject is a child. In such a case (and aside from complying with the requirements of the GDPR, including the ‘specific protections’ which apply to children),[[9]](#_ftn9) the controller must ensure that it complies with the relevant national laws on the capacity of children to enter into contracts. Furthermore, to ensure compliance with the fairness and lawfulness principles, the controller needs to satisfy other legal requirements. For example, for consumer contracts, Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts (the “Unfair Contract Terms Directive”) may be applicable.[[10]](#_ftn10) Article 6(1)(b) is not limited to contracts governed by the law of an EEA member state.[[11]](#_ftn11)\n\n14.  Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR provides for the purpose limitation principle, which requires that personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.\n\n15.  Article 5(1)(c) provides for data minimisation as a principle, i.e. processing as little data as possible in order to achieve the purpose. This assessment complements the necessity assessments pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) to (f).\n\n16.  Both purpose limitation and data minimisation principles are particularly relevant in contracts for online services, which typically are not negotiated on an individual basis. Technological advancements make it possible for controllers to easily collect and process more personal data than ever before. As a result, there is an acute risk that data controllers may seek to include general processing terms in contracts in order to maximise the possible collection and uses of data, without adequately specifying those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations. WP29 has previously stated:\n\n_The purpose of the collection must be clearly and specifically identified: it must be detailed enough to determine what kind of processing is and is not included within the specified purpose, and to allow that compliance with the law can be assessed and data protection safeguards applied. For these reasons, a purpose that is vague or general, such as for instance 'improving users' experience', 'marketing purposes', 'IT-security purposes' or 'future research' will - without more detail - usually not meet the criteria of being ‘specific’._[[12]](#_ftn12)\n\n## 2.2         Interaction of Article 6(1)(b) with other lawful bases for processing\n\n17.  Where processing is not considered ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’, i.e. when a requested service can be provided without the specific processing taking place, the EDPB recognises that another lawful basis may be applicable, provided the relevant conditions are met. In particular, in some circumstances it may be more appropriate to rely on freely given consent under Article 6(1)(a). In other instances, Article 6(1)(f) may provide a more appropriate lawful basis for processing. The legal basis must be identified at the outset of processing, and information given to data subjects in line with Articles 13 and 14 must specify the legal basis.\n\n18.  It is possible that another lawful basis than Article 6(1)(b) may better match the objective and context of the processing operation in question. The identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to principles of fairness and purpose limitation.[[13]](#_ftn13)\n\n19.  The WP29 guidelines on consent also clarify that where “a controller seeks to process personal data that are in fact necessary for the performance of a contract, then consent is not the appropriate lawful basis”_._ Conversely, the EDPB considers that where processing is not in fact necessary for the performance of a contract, such processing can take place only if it relies on another appropriate legal basis.[[14]](#_ftn14)\n\n20.  In line with their transparency obligations, controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis is. This is particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects. Depending on the circumstances, data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) when signing a contract or accepting terms of service. At the same time, a controller might erroneously assume that the signature of a contract corresponds to a consent in the sense of article 6(1)(a). These are entirely different concepts. It is important to distinguish between accepting terms of service to conclude a contract and giving consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a), as these concepts have different requirements and legal consequences.\n\n21.  In relation to the processing of special categories of personal data, in the guidelines on consent, WP29 has also observed that:\n\n_Article 9(2) does not recognize ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’ as an exception to the general prohibition to process special categories of data. Therefore controllers and Member States that deal with this situation should explore the specific exceptions in Article 9(2) subparagraphs (b) to (j). Should none of the exceptions (b) to (j) apply, obtaining explicit consent in accordance with the conditions for valid consent in the GDPR remains the only possible lawful exception to process such data._[[15]](#_ftn15)\n\n## 2.3         Scope of Article 6(1)(b)\n\n22. Article 6(1)(b) applies where either of two conditions are met: the processing in question must be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract with a data subject, or the processing must be objectively necessary in order to take pre-contractual steps at the request of a data subject.\n\n## 2.4         Necessity\n\n23.  Necessity of processing is a prerequisite for both parts of Article 6(1)(b). At the outset, it is important to note that the concept of what is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’ is not simply an assessment of what is permitted by or written into the terms of a contract. The concept of necessity has an independent meaning in European Union law, which must reflect the objectives of data protection law.[[16]](#_ftn16) Therefore, it also involves consideration of the fundamental right to privacy and protection of personal data,[[17]](#_ftn17) as well as the requirements of data protection principles including, notably, the fairness principle.\n\n24.  The starting point is to identify the purpose for the processing, and in the context of a contractual relationship, there may be a variety of purposes for processing. Those purposes must be clearly specified and communicated to the data subject, in line with the controller’s purpose limitation and transparency obligations.\n\n25.  Assessing what is ‘necessary’ involves a combined, fact-based assessment of the processing “for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared to other options for achieving the same goal”.[[18]](#_ftn18) If there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not ‘necessary’.[[19]](#_ftn19) Article 6(1)(b) will not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service or for taking relevant pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes.\n\n## 2.5         Necessary for performance of a contract with the data subject\n\n26.  A controller can rely on the first option of Article 6(1)(b) to process personal data when it can, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2), establish both that the processing takes place in the context of a valid contract with the data subject and that processing is necessary in order that the _particular contract_ with the data subject can be performed. Where controllers cannot demonstrate that (a) a contract exists, (b) the contract is valid pursuant to applicable national contract laws, and (c) that the processing is objectively necessary for the performance of the contract, the controller should consider another legal basis for processing.\n\n27.  Merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b). On the other hand, processing may be objectively necessary even if not specifically mentioned in the contract. In any case, the controller must meet its transparency obligations. Where a controller seeks to establish that the processing is based on the performance of a contract with the data subject, it is important to assess what is _objectively necessary_ to perform the contract. ‘Necessary for performance’ clearly requires something more than a contractual clause. This is also clear in light of Article 7(4). Albeit this provision only regards validity of consent, it illustratively makes a distinction between processing activities necessary for the performance of a contract, and _clauses_ making the service conditional on certain processing activities that are not in fact necessary for the performance of the contract.\n\n28.  In this regard, the EDPB endorses the guidance previously adopted by WP29 on the equivalent provision under the previous Directive that ‘necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject’:\n\n_… must be interpreted strictly and does not cover situations where the processing is not genuinely necessary for the performance of a contract, but rather unilaterally imposed on the data subject by the controller. Also the fact that some processing is covered by a contract does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. […] Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract._[[20]](#_ftn20)\n\n29.  The EDPB also recalls the same WP29 guidance stating:\n\n_There is a clear connection here between the assessment of necessity and compliance with the purpose limitation principle. It is important to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance._21\n\n30.  When assessing whether Article 6(1)(b) is an appropriate legal basis for processing in the context of an online contractual service, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service. For applicability of Article 6(1)(b), it is required that the processing is _objectively necessary_ for a purpose that is integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject. Not excluded is processing of payment details for the purpose of charging for the service. The controller should be able to demonstrate how the main subject-matter of the _specific contract with the data subject_ cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the _personal data in question_ does not\n\noccur. The important issue here is the nexus between the personal data and processing operations concerned, and the performance or non-performance of the service provided under the contract.\n\n31.  Contracts for digital services may incorporate express terms that impose additional conditions about advertising, payments or cookies, amongst other things. A contract cannot artificially expand the categories of personal data or types of processing operation that the controller needs to carry out for the performance of the contract within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b).\n\n32.  ==The controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not just on the controller’s perspective, but also a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract, and whether the contract can still be considered to be ‘performed’ without the processing in question. Although the controller may consider that the processing is necessary for the contractual purpose, it is important that they examine carefully the perspective of an average data subject in order to ensure that there is a genuine mutual understanding on the contractual purpose.==\n\n33.  In order to carry out the assessment of whether Article 6(1)(b) is applicable, the following questions can be of guidance:\n\n•       What is the nature of the service being provided to the data subject? What are its distinguishing characteristics?\n\n•       What is the exact rationale of the contract (i.e. its substance and fundamental object)?\n\n•       What are the essential elements of the contract?\n\n==•       What are the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract? How is the service promoted or advertised to the data subject? Would an ordinary user of the service reasonably expect that, considering the nature of the service, the envisaged processing will take place in order to perform the contract to which they are a party?==\n\n34.  If the assessment of what is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’, which must be conducted prior to the commencement of processing, shows that the intended processing goes beyond what is objectively necessary for the performance of a contract, this does not render such future processing unlawful per se. As already mentioned, Article 6 makes clear that other lawful bases are potentially available prior to the initiation of the processing.[[21]](#_ftn21)\n\n35.  If, over the lifespan of a service, new technology is introduced that changes how personal data are processed, or the service otherwise evolves, the criteria above need to be assessed anew to determine if any new or altered processing operations can be based on Article 6(1)(b).\n\nExample 1\n\nA  data subject buys items from an online retailer. The data subject wants to pay by credit card and for the products to be delivered to their home address. In order to fulfil the contract, the retailer must process the data subject’s credit card information and billing address for payment purposes and the data subject’s home address for delivery. Thus, Article 6(1)(b) is applicable as a legal basis for these processing activities.\n\nHowever, if the customer has opted for shipment to a pick-up point, the processing of the data subject’s home address is no longer necessary for the performance of the purchase contract. Any processing of the data subject’s address in this context will require a different legal basis than Article 6(1)(b).\n\nExample 2\n\nThe same online retailer wishes to build profiles of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on their visits to the website. Completion of the purchase contract is not dependent upon building such profiles. Even if profiling is specifically mentioned in the contract, this fact alone does not make it ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract. If the on-line retailer wants to carry out such profiling, it needs to rely on a different legal basis.\n\n36.  ==Within the boundaries of contractual law, and if applicable, consumer law, controllers are free to design their business, services and contracts. In some cases, a controller may wish to bundle several separate services or elements of a service with different fundamental purposes, features or rationale into one contract. This may create a ‘take it or leave it’ situation for data subjects who may only be interested in one of the services.==\n\n37.  As a matter of data protection law, controllers need to take into account that the processing activities foreseen must have an appropriate legal basis. Where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can in fact reasonably be performed independently of one another, the question arises to which extent Article 6(1)(b) can serve as a legal basis. The applicability of Article 6(1)(b) should be assessed in the context of each of those services _separately_, looking at what is objectively necessary to perform each of the individual services which the data subject has actively requested or signed up for. This assessment may reveal that certain processing activities are not necessary for the individual services requested by the data subject, but rather necessary for the controller’s wider business model. In that case, Article 6(1)(b) will not be a legal basis for those activities. However, other legal bases may be available for that processing, such as Article 6(1)(a) or (f), provided that the relevant criteria are met. Therefore, the assessment of the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) does not affect the legality of the contract or the bundling of services as such.\n\n38.  As WP29 has previously observed, the legal basis only applies to what is necessary for the _performance_ of a contract.[[22]](#_ftn22) As such, it does not automatically apply to all further actions triggered by noncompliance or to all other incidents in the execution of a contract. However, certain actions can be reasonably foreseen and necessary within a normal contractual relationship, such as sending formal reminders about outstanding payments or correcting errors or delays in the performance of the contract. Article 6(1)(b) may cover processing of personal data which is necessary in relation to such actions.\n\nExample 3\n\nA  company sells products online. A customer contacts the company because the colour of the product purchased is different from what was agreed upon. The processing of personal data of the customer for the purpose of rectifying this issue can be based on Article 6(1)(b).\n\n39.  Contractual warranty may be part of performing a contract, and thus storing certain data for a specified retention time after exchange of goods/services/payment has been finalised for the purpose of warranties may be necessary for the performance of a contract.\n\n## 2.6         Termination of contract\n\n40.  A controller needs to identify the appropriate legal basis for the envisaged processing operations before the processing commences. Where Article 6(1)(b) is the basis for some or all processing activities, the controller should anticipate what happens if that contract is erminated.[[23]](#_ftn23)\n\n41.  Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1)(b) and the contract is terminated in full, then as a general rule, the processing of that data will no longer be necessary for the performance of that contract and thus the controller will need to stop processing. The data subject might have provided their personal data in the context of a contractual relationship trusting that the data would only be processed as a necessary part of that relationship. Hence, it is generally unfair to swap to a new legal basis when the original basis ceases to exist.\n\n42.  When a contract is terminated, this may entail some administration, such as returning goods or payment. The associated processing may be based on Article 6(1)(b).\n\n43.  Article 17(1)(a) provides that personal data shall be erased when they are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected. Nonetheless, this does not apply if processing is necessary for certain specific purposes, including compliance with a legal obligation pursuant to Article 17(3)(b), or the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, pursuant to Article 17(3)(e). In practice, if controllers see a general need to keep records for legal purposes, they need to identify a legal basis for this at the outset of processing, and they need to communicate clearly from the start for how long they plan to retain records for these legal purposes after the termination of a contract. If they do so, they do not need to delete the data upon the termination of the contract.\n\n44.  In any case, it may be that several processing operations with separate purposes and legal bases were identified at the outset of processing. As long as those other processing operations remain lawful and the controller communicated clearly about those operations at the commencement of processing in line with the transparency obligations of the GDPR, it will still be possible to process personal data about the data subject for those separate purposes after the contract has been terminated.\n\nExample 4\n\nAn online service provides a subscription service that can be cancelled at any time. When a contract for the service is concluded, the controller provides information to the data subject on the processing of personal data.\n\nThe controller explains, _inter alia_, that as long as the contract is in place, it will process data about the use of the service to issue invoices. The applicable legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) as the processing for invoicing purposes can be considered to be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract. However, when the contract is terminated and assuming there are no pending, relevant legal claims or legal requirements to retain the data, the usage history will be deleted.\n\nFurthermore, the controller informs data subjects that it has a legal obligation in national law to retain certain personal data for accounting purposes for a specified number of years. The appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(c), and retention will take place even if the contract is terminated.\n\n## 2.7         Necessary for taking steps prior to entering into a contract\n\n45.  The second option of Article 6(1)(b) applies where _processing is necessary in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract_. This provision reflects the fact that preliminary processing of personal data may be necessary before entering into a contract in order to facilitate the actual entering into that contract.\n\n46.  At the time of processing, it may not be clear whether a contract will actually be entered into. The second option of Article 6(1)(b) may nonetheless apply as long as the data subject makes the request in the context of _potentially_ entering into a contract and the processing in question is necessary to take the steps requested. In line with this, where a data subject contacts the controller to enquire about the details of the controller’s service offerings, the processing of the data subject’s personal data for the purpose of responding to the enquiry can be based on Article 6(1)(b).\n\n47.  In any case, this provision would not cover unsolicited marketing or other processing which is carried out solely on the initiative of the data controller, or at the request of a third party.\n\nExample 5\n\nA data subject provides their postal code to see if a particular service provider operates in their area. This can be regarded as processing necessary to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b).\n\nExample 6\n\nIn some cases, financial institutions have a duty to identify their customers pursuant to national laws. In line with this, before entering into a contract with data subjects, a bank requests to see their identity documents.\n\nIn this case, the identification is necessary for a legal obligation on behalf of the bank rather than to take steps at the data subject’s request. Therefore, the appropriate legal basis is not Article 6(1)(b), but Article 6(1)(c).\n\n# 3         PART 3 – APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 6(1)(B) IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS\n\n## 3.1         Processing for ‘service improvement’[[24]](#_ftn24)\n\n48.  Online services often collect detailed information on how users engage with their service. In most cases, collection of organisational metrics relating to a service or details of user engagement, cannot be regarded as necessary for the provision of the service as the service could be delivered in the absence of processing such personal data. Nevertheless, a service provider may be able to rely on alternative lawful bases for this processing, such as legitimate interest or consent.\n\n49.  The EDPB does not consider that Article 6(1)(b) would generally be an appropriate lawful basis for processing for the purposes of improving a service or developing new functions within an existing service. In most cases, a user enters into a contract to avail of an existing service. While the possibility of improvements and modifications to a service may routinely be included in contractual terms, such processing usually cannot be regarded as being objectively necessary for the performance of the contract with the user.\n\n## 3.2         Processing for ‘fraud prevention’\n\n50. As WP29 has previously noted,[[25]](#_ftn25) processing for fraud prevention purposes may involve monitoring and profiling customers. In the view of the EDPB, such processing is likely to go beyond what is objectively necessary for the performance of a contract with a data subject. However, the processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud may constitute a legitimate interest of the data controller[[26]](#_ftn26) and could thus be considered lawful, if the specific requirements of Article 6(1)(f)(legitimate interests) are met by the data controller. In addition Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) could also provide a lawful basis for such processing of data.\n\n## 3.3         Processing for online behavioural advertising\n\n51.  Online behavioural advertising, and associated tracking and profiling of data subjects, is often used to finance online services. WP29 has previously stated its view on such processing, stating:\n\n_[contractual necessity] is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices based on his clickstream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for example._[[27]](#_ftn27)\n\n52.  As a general rule, processing of personal data for behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract for online services. Normally, it would be hard to argue that the contract\n\nhad not been performed because there were no behavioural ads. This is all the more supported by the fact that data subjects have the absolute right under Article 21 to object to processing of their data for direct marketing purposes.\n\n53.  Further to this, Article 6(1)(b) cannot provide a lawful basis for online behavioural advertising simply because such advertising indirectly funds the provision of the service. Although such processing may support the delivery of a service, this in itself is not sufficient to establish that it is necessary for the performance of the contract at issue. The controller would need to consider the factors outlined in paragraph 33.\n\n54.  Considering that data protection is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and taking into account that one of the main purposes of the GDPR is to provide data subjects with control over information relating to them, personal data cannot be considered as a tradeable commodity. Even if the data subject can agree to the processing of personal data,[[28]](#_ftn28) they cannot trade away their fundamental rights through this agreement.[[29]](#_ftn29)\n\n55.  The EDPB also notes that, in line with ePrivacy requirements and the existing WP29 opinion on behavioural advertising,[[30]](#_ftn30) and Working Document 02/2013 providing guidance on obtaining consent for cookies,[[31]](#_ftn31) controllers must obtain data subjects’ prior consent to place the cookies necessary to engage in behavioural advertising.\n\n56.  The EDPB also notes that tracking and profiling of users may be carried out for the purpose of identifying groups of individuals with similar characteristics, to enable targeting advertising to similar audiences. Such processing cannot be carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b), as it cannot be said to be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract with the user to track and compare users’ characteristics and behaviour for purposes which relate to advertising to other individuals.33\n\n## 3.4         Processing for personalisation of content[[32]](#_ftn32)\n\n57. The EDPB acknowledges that personalisation of content may (but does not always) constitute an intrinsic and expected element of certain online services, and therefore may be regarded as necessary for the performance of the contract with the service user in some cases. Whether such processing can be regarded as an intrinsic aspect of an online service, will depend on the nature of the service provided, the expectations of the average data subject in light not only of the terms of service but also the way the service is promoted to users, and whether the service can be provided without personalisation. Where personalisation of content is not objectively necessary for the purpose of the underlying contract, for example where personalised content delivery is intended to increase user engagement with a service but is not an integral part of using the service, data controllers should consider an alternative lawful basis where applicable.\n\nExample 7\n\nAn online hotel search engine monitors past bookings of users in order to create a profile of their typical expenditure. This profile is subsequently used to recommend particular hotels to the user when returning search results. In this case, profiling of user’s past behaviour and financial data would not be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract, i.e. the provision of hospitality services based on particular search criteria provided by the user. Therefore, Article 6(1)(b) would not be applicable to this processing activity.\n\nExample 8\n\nAn online marketplace allows potential buyers to browse for and purchase products. The marketplace wishes to display personalised product suggestions based on which listings the potential buyers have previously viewed on the platform in order to increase interactivity. This personalisation it is not objectively necessary to provide the marketplace service. Thus, such processing of personal data cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis.\n\n  \n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).\n\n[[2]](#_ftnref2) See also recital 44.\n\n[[3]](#_ftnref3) See for example Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Article 8 GDPR.\n\n[[4]](#_ftnref4) See Recital 18 of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market.\n\n[[5]](#_ftnref5) In this regard, controllers need to fulfil the transparency obligations set out in the GDPR.\n\n[[6]](#_ftnref6) Established under Article 68 GDPR.\n\n[[7]](#_ftnref7) Article 29 Working Party Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC (WP217).

Like the transparency obligation in the GDPR, the Unfair Contract Terms Directive mandates the use of plain, intelligible language. Processing of personal data that is based on what is deemed to be an unfair term under the Unfair Contract Terms Directive, will generally not be consistent with the requirement under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that processing is lawful and fair.\n\n[[11]](#_ftnref11) The GDPR applies to certain controllers outside the EEA; see Article 3 GDPR.\n\n[[12]](#_ftnref12) Article 29 Working Party Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation (WP203), page 15–16.\n\n[[13]](#_ftnref13) When controllers set out to identify the appropriate legal basis in line with the fairness principle, this will be difficult to achieve if they have not first clearly identified the purposes of processing, or if processing personal data goes beyond what is necessary for the specified purposes.\n\n[[14]](#_ftnref14) For more information on implications in relation to Article 9, see Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 (WP259), endorsed by the EDPB, pages 19–20.\n\n[[15]](#_ftnref15) Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 (WP259), endorsed by the EDPB, page 19.\n\n[[16]](#_ftnref16) The CJEU stated in _Huber_ that “what is at issue is a concept [necessity] which has its own independent meaning in\n\nCommunity law and which must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that Directive, [Directive 95/46], as laid down in Article 1(1) thereof”.

For example, money is countable, meaning that prices can be compared in a competitive market, and monetary payments can normally only be made with the data subject’s involvement. Furthermore, personal data can be exploited by several services at the same time. Once control over one’s personal data has been lost, that control may not necessarily be regained.\n\n[[30]](#_ftnref30) Article 29 Working Party Opinion 2/2010 on online behavioural advertising (WP171).\n\n[[31]](#_ftnref31) Article 29 Working Party Working Document 02/2013 providing guidance on obtaining consent for cookies (WP208). 33 See also Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (WP251rev.01), endorsed by the EDPB, page 13.\n\n[[32]](#_ftnref32) Online services may also need to take into account Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services (OJ L 136, 22.05.2019, p. 1), which will apply as from 1 January 2022.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.911788487Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/Excerpts":{"title":"","content":"\n# CJEU\n_Questions 3 and 4_\n\n![[CJEU#^0c0001]]\n![[CJEU#^10a2d0]]\n\n...\n[[CJEU^97]]\n97      As regards, in the first place, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract’.\n\n98      In that regard, in order for the processing of personal data to be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract, within the meaning of that provision, it must be ==**objectively indispensable**== for a purpose that is ==integral== to the contractual obligation ==intended for the data subject==. The controller must therefore be able to demonstrate how ==the main subject matter of the contract **cannot be achieved**== if the processing in question does not occur.\n\n99      The fact that such processing may be ==referred to in the contract or may be **merely useful**== for the performance of the contract is, in itself, i==rrelevant in that regard.== The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be ==**essential** for the **proper performance**== of the contract concluded **between the controller and the data subject** and, therefore, that there are ==no workable, less intrusive alternatives.==\n\n100    In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point 54 of his Opinion, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately.\n\n101    In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of that provision, the referring court mentions, as elements intended to ensure the proper performance of the contract concluded between Meta Platforms Ireland and its users, personalised content and the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services.\n\n102    As regards, first, the justification based on personalised content, it is important to note that, although such a personalisation is useful to the user, in so far as it enables the user, inter alia, to view content corresponding to a large extent to his or her interests, the fact remains that, subject to verification by the referring court, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer that user the services of the online social network. Those services may, where appropriate, be provided to the user in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services.\n\n103    As regards, second, the justification based on the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group’s own services, it is apparent from the file before the Court that there is no obligation to subscribe to the various services offered by the Meta group in order to create a user account in the social network Facebook. The various products and services offered by that group can be used independently of each other and the use of each product or service is based on the conclusion of a separate user agreement.\n\n104    Therefore, and subject to verification by the referring court, the processing of personal data from services offered by the Meta group, other than the online social network service, does not appear to be necessary for the latter service to be provided.\n\n# AG\n\n _The third question_\n[[AG#^73128e]]\n53.      First, according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. ([^73](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote73))\n\n54.      In that regard, I note that the concept of ‘necessity’ is not defined in EU legislation, but according to the case-law, is still an autonomous concept of EU law. ([^74](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote74)) [[CJEU Huber#^86257c]] For the processing to be necessary for the performance of the contract, it is not sufficient for it to be carried out at the time of performance of the contract, to be mentioned in the contract, ([75](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote75)) or even merely to be useful for the performance of the contract. ([76](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote76)) According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the processing must be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract in the sense that there must be no realistic, less intrusive alternatives, ([77](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote77)) taking into account the reasonable expectations of the data subject. ([78](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote78)) It also concerns the fact that, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately. ([79](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote79))\n\n55.      As part of that justification, the referring court mentions the personalised content and continuous, seamless use of the group’s products (or rather services).\n\n56.      As far as the personalised content is concerned, it seems to me that, although that activity may, to some extent, be in the user’s interest, since it makes it possible to display content, particularly in the ‘newsfeed’, which, on the basis of an automated evaluation, matches the user’s interests, it is not apparent that it is also necessary in order to provide the service of the social network at issue, such that the processing of personal data to that end does not require the user’s consent. ([80](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote80)) For the purpose of that examination, consideration should also be given to the fact that the practice at issue concerns the processing not of data relating to the user’s activities on the Facebook site or app, but data originating from external and therefore potentially unlimited sources. Therefore, I am curious as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up for. ([81](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote81))\n\n57.      With regard to the continuous, seamless use of the group’s services, I note that a link between the various services offered by the applicant in the main proceedings – for example, between Facebook and Instagram – could be useful or even preferable on occasion for the user. However, I doubt that the processing of personal data from other group services (including Instagram) is necessary to provide Facebook services. ([82](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote82))\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.911788487Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/Facts":{"title":"","content":"\n# CJEU\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n26      Meta Platforms Ireland operates the online social network Facebook within the European Union and promotes, inter alia via www.facebook.com, services that are free of charge for private users. Other undertakings of the Meta group offer, within the European Union, other online services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.\n\n==27      The business model of the online social network Facebook is based on financing through online advertising, which is tailored to the individual users of the social network according, inter alia, to their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Such advertising is made possible in technical terms by the automated production of detailed profiles in respect of the network users and the users of the online services offered at the level of the Meta group.== To that end, in addition to the data provided by the users directly when they sign up for the online services concerned, ==other user- and device-related data are also collected on and off that social network and the online services provided by the Meta group, and linked to their various user accounts==. The aggregate view of the data allows detailed conclusions to be drawn about those users’ preferences and interests.\n\n28      For the processing of those data, Meta Platforms Ireland relies on the user agreement to which the users of the social network Facebook adhere when they click on the ‘Sign up’ button, thereby accepting the general terms drawn up by that company. Acceptance of those terms is necessary in order to be able to use the social network Facebook. With regard to the processing of personal data, the general terms refer to that company’s data and cookies policies. According to those policies, Meta Platforms Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and links the data with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned. ==The latter data, relating to activities outside the social network (‘the off-Facebook data’), are data concerning visits to third-party webpages and apps, which are linked to Facebook through programming interfaces – ‘Facebook Business Tools’ – as well as data concerning the use of other online services belonging to the Meta group, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.==\n\n29      The Federal Cartel Office brought proceedings against Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland, as a result of which, by decision of 6 February 2019, based on Paragraph 19(1) and Paragraph 32 of the GWB, it essentially prohibited those companies from making, in the general terms, ==the use of the social network Facebook by private users resident in Germany subject to the processing of their off-Facebook data and from processing the data without their consent on the basis of the general terms in force at the time==. In addition, it required them to adapt those general terms in such a way that it is made clear that those data will neither be collected, nor linked with Facebook user accounts nor used without the consent of the user concerned, and it clarified the fact that such a consent is not valid if it is a condition for using the social network.\n\n30      The Federal Cartel Office based its decision on the fact that the processing of the data of the users concerned, as provided for in the general terms and implemented by Meta Platforms Ireland, constituted an abuse of that company’s dominant position on the market for online social networks for private users in Germany, within the meaning of Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB. In particular, according to the Federal Cartel Office, those general terms, as a result of that dominant position, constitute an abuse since the processing of the off-Facebook data that they provide for is not consistent with the underlying values of the GDPR and, in particular, it cannot be justified in the light of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2) of that regulation.\n\n31      On 11 February 2019, Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland brought an action against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office before the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany).\n\n32      On 31 July 2019, Meta Platforms Ireland introduced new general terms expressly stating that the user, instead of paying to use Facebook products, agrees to being shown advertisements.\n\n33      Furthermore, since 28 January 2020, Meta Platforms has been offering, at a global level, ‘_Off-Facebook Activity_’, which allows the users of the social network Facebook to view a summary of the information about them that Meta group companies obtain in relation to their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect the data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish.\n\n34      The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) has doubts (i) as to whether national competition authorities may review, in the exercise of their powers, whether the processing of personal data complies with the requirements set out in the GDPR; (ii) as to whether the operator of an online social network may process the data subject’s sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation; (iii) as to the lawfulness of the processing by such an operator of the personal data of the user concerned, under Article 6(1) of that regulation; and (iv) as to the validity, in the light of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of that regulation, of the consent given to an undertaking with a dominant position on the national market for online social networks for the purposes of such processing. \n\n==(3)      Can an undertaking, such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland], which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and consistent, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?==\n\n# AG\n\n9.        Meta Platforms operates the online social network ‘Facebook’ in the European Union (www.facebook.com), as well as other online services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The business model of the social networks operated by Meta Platforms essentially consists of offering social network services free of charge for private users and selling online advertising. The advertising is tailored to individual users and aims to show them products and services that might interest them on the basis of, inter alia, their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. The technical basis for this type of advertising is the automated production of detailed profiles of users of Facebook and the online services offered at group level. ([6](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote6))\n\n10.      In order to collect and process user data, Meta Platforms relies on the contract for the use of the services entered into with its users when they click on the ‘Sign up’ button, thereby accepting Facebook’s terms of service. Acceptance of those terms of service is an essential requirement for using the Facebook social network. ([7](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote7)) The central element of this case is the practice of _collecting_ data from other group services, as well as from third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces or via cookies placed on the user’s computer or mobile device, _linking_ those data with the user’s Facebook account and then _using_ them (‘the practice at issue’).\n\n11.      The Federal Cartel Office initiated proceedings against Meta Platforms as a result of which, by the decision at issue, it prohibited Meta Platforms from processing data as provided for in Facebook’s terms of service and from implementing those terms, and imposed measures to stop it from doing so. The Federal Cartel Office based its decision, inter alia, on the fact that under Paragraph 19 of the GWB, the processing in question constituted an abuse of the company’s dominant position in the social media market for private users in Germany. ([8](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote8))\n\n12.      On 11 February 2019, Meta Platforms brought an action against the decision at issue before the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf), ([9](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?mode=DOC\u0026pageIndex=1\u0026docid=265901\u0026part=1\u0026doclang=EN\u0026text=\u0026dir=\u0026occ=first\u0026cid=405979#Footnote9)) which is the referring court. In essence, the referring court has doubts as to the ability of national competition authorities to monitor the compliance of data processing with the requirements laid down in the GDPR and to determine and penalise breaches of the GDPR. It also has doubts as to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of that regulation.\n\n13.      In those circumstances, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n==(3)      Can an undertaking, such as Facebook Ireland, which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and continuous, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s [Facebook] account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?==\n\n# Reference\n\nThe second applicant (‘Facebook Ireland’) operates the digital social network Facebook.com in Europe, a network that is free of charge for private users. The first applicant is its US parent company. The third applicant is a German sister company of Facebook Ireland that provides it with advertising, communication and public relations support (jointly also ‘Facebook’). \n\nPrivate users can set up a personal Facebook page on Facebook.com which they can use to communicate with third parties. They can create their own posts in the ‘Newsfeed’ on their Facebook page and share them with their Facebook friends or publicly on the network as they wish; they can also receive communications in their Newsfeed from their Facebook friends or other content providers and undertakings represented on Facebook.com to which they have subscribed. In addition, they can show content from third-party websites and apps in their Newsfeed, and that of their Facebook friends, by clicking or tapping on the social plugins (particularly ‘Like’ or ‘Share’). With ‘Facebook Login’ and ‘Account Kit’, users can log in or create a profile on third-party websites and apps using only their Facebook registration data. \n\n==Facebook offers undertakings the opportunity to integrate the social plugin buttons (particularly Like and Share) and Facebook Login and Account Kit into their websites and apps with predefined interfaces called ‘Facebook Business Tools’. These interfaces transmit user data to Facebook.com, regardless of whether or not the website and app users actually click or tap on the buttons.== #important-fact\n\nFacebook.com is funded by online advertising, which is tailored to its individual users and aims to show them advertisements that might interest them on the basis of their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Advertisers can use the ‘Ads Manager’ to specify their target audience and have advertisements displayed to users; they can also transmit their [Or. 7] customer lists to Facebook in encrypted form and optimise their advertising by comparing their data with data from the social network. Facebook offers other analysis and measurement tools (advertising reports and ‘Facebook Analytics’), also under Facebook Business Tools, which advertisers can use to measure the success of their advertising, analyse their own online services and obtain aggregated statistics in respect of their target audience. This is also done by integrating interfaces (‘Facebook pixel’ or ‘SDK’ (software development kit)), which record user behaviour on third-party websites and apps, regardless of whether the user takes any corresponding action. #important-fact \n\nThe Facebook group provides other services beyond the social network, including Instagram, the free service funded by advertising for ‘sharing’ photos and short video clips, which is also operated in Europe by Facebook Ireland; WhatsApp, the free service for sending and receiving a variety of media such as text messages, images, videos, contacts, documents, locations, voice messages and calls, which is not funded by advertising and is operated in Europe by WhatsApp Ireland Ltd; and Oculus, which sells virtual reality glasses and software and is operated in Europe by another subsidiary, Facebook Technologies Ireland Ltd. Until 13 March 2020, Facebook also provided the Masquerade service for the editing and ‘sharing’ of photos. \n\nBy clicking on the ‘Sign up’ button on Facebook.com, private users in Europe enter into a contract for the use of the service and agree to Facebook Ireland’s terms of service. Under those terms, Facebook Ireland processes personal data; users are referred in particular to Facebook Ireland’s data and cookies policies for further information. According to those policies, Facebook Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and associates the data with the user’s Facebook.com account. User activities off the social network are visits to third-party websites and apps connected to Facebook.com by programming interfaces (Facebook Business Tools), and the use of the other Facebook services Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, in respect of which data are processed ‘across the other Facebook companies and products’. #important-fact \n\n==By decision of 6 February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (Law against restrictions on competition, ‘the GWB’) from processing data as provided for in the terms of service, under Paragraphs 19(1) and 32 of the GWB and imposed measures to stop them from doing so. The prohibition covers the application of terms of service, including as further specified in data and cookies policies, according to which the use of the Facebook.com network by private users resident in Germany is dependent on Facebook Ireland being able to collect user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade and from visits to third-party websites or apps via Facebook Business Tools without the user’s consent, to link those data with the user’s Facebook.com data and to use them (point 1 of the operative part of the decision). Furthermore, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the GWB from implementing those terms with the actual data processing operations performed by Facebook Ireland on the basis of the data and cookies policies (point 2 of the operative part of the decision) and obliged them to amend the terms of service and their implementation so as to make it absolutely clear that user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade, and from Facebook Business Tools, will not, or not without the user’s consent, be collected, linked to the user’s Facebook.com account and used (point 3 of the operative part of the decision). Finally, the Office made clear, in point 4 of the operative part of its decision, that no consent on the part of the user exists if the provision of Facebook.com is made conditional on consent being given.== #important-fact \n\nOn 11 February 2019, the applicants lodged an appeal against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office with the Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf within the time limit and in the manner prescribed. \n\nFacebook Ireland introduced new and essentially identical terms of service on 31 July 2019 on the initiative of the European Commission and the national consumer protection organisations of the Member States; point 2 of those terms states expressly that the user agrees to be shown advertisements instead of paying to use Facebook products. Since 28 January 2020, Facebook has provided the  ‘off-Facebook activity’ (‘OFA’) tool worldwide. Facebook users can use the tool to view a summary of the information obtained by Facebook about their activities on other websites and apps and disconnect these data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish. \n...\n\ncc)\tSince the processing of off-Facebook data, as provided for in the terms of service – including within the group – is lawful if it is justified by at least one of the grounds under Article 6(1)(a) to (f) of the GDPR, and the Court of Justice has already ruled that the identical provision of Article 7 of the preceding Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) provides an exhaustive and conclusive list of cases in which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful and that Member States may neither introduce new principles for the lawful processing of personal data alongside this Article, nor impose additional conditions which would alter the scope of any of the principles provided for therein (see judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion Id, C-40/17 [EU:C:2019:629], paragraph 55, available from JURIS; judgment of 19 October 2016, Breyer, C-582/14, paragraph 57, available from JURIS; judgment of 24 November 2011, ASNEF and FECEMD, C-468/10 and C-469/10, paragraphs 30 and 32, available from JURIS), is the processing of off-Facebook data as provided for in the terms of service only ever justifiable if consent is obtained? For only then could the Federal Cartel Office order that, for data protection reasons, such data may not be processed or may be processed only if consent is given . \n\n(1) According to point 1 (‘The services we provide’) of its current terms of service (Annex Bf 9), the following contractual services relevant to this case are provided by Facebook Ireland as part of its social network: 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook’s products. \n\nFacebook Ireland collects the user- and device-related data listed in its Data Policy (Annex Bf 10) under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ from the use of its group services and from Facebook Business Tools; it links these data with the data collected and stored while Facebook.com is being used and, according to the section headed ‘How do we use this information?’, uses it to provide, personalise and improve its products, to provide measurement, analytics and other business services, to promote safety, integrity and security, to communicate with users and to research and innovate for social good; according to the [Or. 16] section headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’, it also uses it ‘across the Facebook Companies.’ \n\nAccording to its Cookies Policy (Annex Bf 11), Facebook Ireland sets cookies or uses other storage technologies when users use the group’s services and visit third-party websites and apps that have integrated Facebook Business Tools, and collects user- and device-related data without any further action by the user; it uses those data to provide its services and for security, advertising and analytics purposes. \n\nThe kinds of data collected and used are detailed in the Data Policy under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ (Annex Bf 10) and in point 2(a) to (d) of the operative part of the Office’s decision. \n\nFacebook Ireland relies in the section of its Data Policy headed ‘What is our legal basis for processing data?’(Annex Bf 10) on all of the grounds under Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Under the heading ‘Learn more about these legal bases’ (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR 1. for processing data with special protections that are provided by users in their Facebook.com profile, for sharing with persons they choose and to personalise content, 2. for using facial recognition technology, 3. for using data that advertisers and other partners provide about users’ activity off Facebook Company Products to personalise advertising, 4. for sharing data that personally identifies users with advertisers, 5. for collecting information that users allow Facebook to receive through the device-based settings they enable (GPS location, camera, photos). Facebook Ireland obtains separate consent from users to process their data for these purposes or offers them the chance to object (in the case of facial recognition). \n\nIn the document referred to (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on the justification of necessity for the performance of the contract within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR 1. to provide, personalise and improve its products, 2. to promote safety, integrity and security, 3. to transfer and transmit data outside the EEA, 4. to communicate with users, 5. to provide consistent and seamless experiences across all Facebook Company Products. \n\nFacebook Ireland relies on the justification of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR 1. vis-à-vis minors, 2. for providing measurement, analytics and other business services, 3. for providing marketing communications, 4. to research and innovate for social good, 5. to share information with others including law enforcement agencies and to respond to legal requests. \n\nFacebook Ireland further relies on the justification of compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR), the protection of vital interests (Article 6(1)(d) of the GDPR) and tasks carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) (see Annex Bf 12 for detailed information). \n\n(2) Consent would be required if and in so far as the collection and linking of data with the Facebook.com account and the use of off-Facebook data involved the processing of special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR and no permission other than consent under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR could be given. \n\n....\n\n(a) Question 3 of the request seeks to clarify whether, when Facebook Ireland, as referred to above, offers 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products as contractual services, it can rely on the justification of necessity for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, or on the  justification of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, if it collects **==off-Facebook==** data for these purposes, links those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and uses them. \n\nThe Chamber believes that there is much in the case-law of the Court of Justice with regard to necessity (see judgment of 4 May 2017, Rigas satiksme, C-13/16, paragraph 30, available from JURIS) and the factors taken into consideration by the European Data Protection Board in its Guidelines 2/19 (paragraphs 2, 26 et seq., 48 et seq. and 57, Annex Bf 42B) to support the view that the processing of data for the purposes of personalised advertising, which does not require cookies, of user and network security and of product improvement, can certainly be regarded as being in the legitimate interests of the undertaking; the case-law also appears to suggest that the processing of data to personalise content and, in some cases, also to ensure the consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products can be regarded as necessary for the performance of Facebook Ireland’s contracts. \n\nAccordingly, Facebook Ireland could have a legitimate interest, for example, in processing WhatsApp data for user and network security because, as it states in the section of the Data Policy headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’ (Annex Bf 10), it uses information from WhatsApp accounts sending spam to take action against those accounts on Facebook.com, although this is otherwise neither necessary for the performance of the contract nor likely to be justified by other legitimate interests, since Facebook Ireland does not use WhatsApp data for product and personalisation purposes on Facebook.com (paragraph 746 of the Office’s decision). \n\nThe processing of Instagram data for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products (so that users can be shown people or content on Facebook.com that might also be of interest to them there) could be necessary for the performance of the contract or at least be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. Facebook Ireland could also have a legitimate interest in processing these data for the purposes of personalised advertising, network security and product improvement. In particular, by its own account, Facebook Ireland uses Instagram data from accounts that behave inappropriately or are clearly involved in unlawful activity to ensure the security of Facebook users [Or. 21] (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal). In principle, the same could apply to the processing of Oculus data, although there are not yet enough findings on the specific purposes for which those data are used on Facebook.com. \n\nThe processing of data from Facebook Business Tools, particularly the social plugins Like and Share, and from Facebook Login and Account Kit could be necessary for the performance of the contract, or at least in Facebook Ireland’s legitimate interests, provided it is intended for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products. This should require the user to click or tap on the relevant button and should be limited to the data processing operations required in a particular case. Irrespective of whether or not the user has clicked or tapped on the buttons, the collection of data and the linking of those data with the Facebook.com account could be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland if the user has consented to the use of the data for the display of personalised advertisements. Data processing for the purposes of network security or product improvement could also be legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. By its own account, Facebook uses data from social plugins to identify rapidly, from the many website visits, attempts by bots to open and operate Facebook accounts (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal). \n\n\n```smart-connections\nWhy is processing of personal data by Facebook necessary for performance of the contract?\n```","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.911788487Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/Reference":{"title":"","content":"\n\nThe following questions on the interpretation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, ‘the GDPR’) and Article 4(3) TEU are referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling: \n\n1. \n\na)\tIs it compatible with Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR if a national competition authority – such as the German Federal Cartel Office – which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR, of a Member State in which an undertaking established outside the European Union has an establishment that provides the main establishment of that undertaking – which is located in another Member State and has sole responsibility for processing personal data for the entire territory of the European Union – with advertising, communication and public relations support, finds, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, that the main establishment’s contractual terms relating to data processing and their implementation breach the GDPR and issues an order to end that breach? \n\nb)\tIf so: Is that compatible with Article 4(3) TEU if, at the same time, the lead supervisory authority in the Member State in which the main establishment, within [Or. 3] the meaning of Article 56(1) of the GDPR, is located is investigating the undertaking’s contractual terms relating to data processing?

\n\nb)\tIf so: Does visiting those websites or apps and/or entering information and/or clicking or tapping on the buttons integrated into them by a provider such as Facebook Ireland (social plugins such as ‘Like’, ‘Share’ or ‘Facebook Login’ or ‘Account Kit’) constitute manifestly making the data about the visits themselves and/or the information entered by the user public within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR? \n\n3. \n\nCan an undertaking, such as Facebook Ireland, which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and continuous, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and [Or. 4] third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the \n\nGDPR?

\n\n6. \n\nCan consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR be given effectively and, in accordance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR in particular, freely, to a dominant undertaking such as Facebook Ireland? \n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is no: \n\n7. \n\na)\tCan the national competition authority of a Member State, such as the Federal Cartel Office, which is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 et seq. of the GDPR and which examines a breach by a dominant undertaking of the competition-law prohibition on abuse that is not a breach of the GDPR by that undertaking’s data processing terms and their implementation, determine, when assessing the balance of interests, whether those data processing terms and their implementation comply with the GDPR? \n\nb)\tIf so: In the light of Article 4(3) TEU, does that also apply if the competent lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56(1) of the GDPR is investigating the undertaking’s data processing terms at the same time? \n\nIf the answer to Question 7 is yes, Questions 3 to 5 must be answered in relation to data from the use of the group’s Instagram service. [Or. 6] G r o u n d s \n\nI. \n\nThe second applicant (‘Facebook Ireland’) operates the digital social network Facebook.com in Europe, a network that is free of charge for private users. The first applicant is its US parent company. The third applicant is a German sister company of Facebook Ireland that provides it with advertising, communication and public relations support (jointly also ‘Facebook’). \n\nPrivate users can set up a personal Facebook page on Facebook.com which they can use to communicate with third parties. They can create their own posts in the ‘Newsfeed’ on their Facebook page and share them with their Facebook friends or publicly on the network as they wish; they can also receive communications in their Newsfeed from their Facebook friends or other content providers and undertakings represented on Facebook.com to which they have subscribed. In addition, they can show content from third-party websites and apps in their Newsfeed, and that of their Facebook friends, by clicking or tapping on the social plugins (particularly ‘Like’ or ‘Share’). With ‘Facebook Login’ and ‘Account Kit’, users can log in or create a profile on third-party websites and apps using only their Facebook registration data. \n\nFacebook offers undertakings the opportunity to integrate the social plugin buttons (particularly Like and Share) and Facebook Login and Account Kit into their websites and apps with predefined interfaces called ‘Facebook Business Tools’. These interfaces transmit user data to Facebook.com, regardless of whether or not the website and app users actually click or tap on the buttons. \n\nFacebook.com is funded by online advertising, which is tailored to its individual users and aims to show them advertisements that might interest them on the basis of their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Advertisers can use the ‘Ads Manager’ to specify their target audience and have advertisements displayed to users; they can also transmit their [Or. 7] customer lists to Facebook in encrypted form and optimise their advertising by comparing their data with data from the social network. Facebook offers other analysis and measurement tools (advertising reports and ‘Facebook Analytics’), also under Facebook Business Tools, which advertisers can use to measure the success of their advertising, analyse their own online services and obtain aggregated statistics in respect of their target audience. This is also done by integrating interfaces (‘Facebook pixel’ or ‘SDK’ (software development kit)), which record user behaviour on third-party websites and apps, regardless of whether the user takes any corresponding action. \n\nThe Facebook group provides other services beyond the social network, including Instagram, the free service funded by advertising for ‘sharing’ photos and short video clips, which is also operated in Europe by Facebook Ireland; WhatsApp, the free service for sending and receiving a variety of media such as text messages, images, videos, contacts, documents, locations, voice messages and calls, which is not funded by advertising and is operated in Europe by WhatsApp Ireland Ltd; and Oculus, which sells virtual reality glasses and software and is operated in Europe by another subsidiary, Facebook Technologies Ireland Ltd. Until 13 March 2020, Facebook also provided the Masquerade service for the editing and ‘sharing’ of photos. \n\nBy clicking on the ‘Sign up’ button on Facebook.com, private users in Europe enter into a contract for the use of the service and agree to Facebook Ireland’s terms of service. Under those terms, Facebook Ireland processes personal data; users are referred in particular to Facebook Ireland’s data and cookies policies for further information. According to those policies, Facebook Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and associates the data with the user’s Facebook.com account. User activities off the social network are visits to third-party websites and apps connected to Facebook.com by programming interfaces (Facebook Business Tools), and the use of the other Facebook services Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, in respect of which data are processed ‘across the other Facebook companies and products’. [Or. 8] \n\nBy decision of 6 February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (Law against restrictions on competition, ‘the GWB’) from processing data as provided for in the terms of service, under Paragraphs 19(1) and 32 of the GWB and imposed measures to stop them from doing so. The prohibition covers the application of terms of service, including as further specified in data and cookies policies, according to which the use of the Facebook.com network by private users resident in Germany is dependent on Facebook Ireland being able to collect user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade and from visits to third-party websites or apps via Facebook Business Tools without the user’s consent, to link those data with the user’s Facebook.com data and to use them (point 1 of the operative part of the decision). Furthermore, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the GWB from implementing those terms with the actual data processing operations performed by Facebook Ireland on the basis of the data and cookies policies (point 2 of the operative part of the decision) and obliged them to amend the terms of service and their implementation so as to make it absolutely clear that user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade, and from Facebook Business Tools, will not, or not without the user’s consent, be collected, linked to the user’s Facebook.com account and used (point 3 of the operative part of the decision). Finally, the Office made clear, in point 4 of the operative part of its decision, that no consent on the part of the user exists if the provision of Facebook.com is made conditional on consent being given. \n\nOn 11 February 2019, the applicants lodged an appeal against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office with the Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf within the time limit and in the manner prescribed. \n\nFacebook Ireland introduced new and essentially identical terms of service on 31 July 2019 on the initiative of the European Commission and the national consumer protection organisations of the Member States; point 2 of those terms states expressly that the user agrees to be shown advertisements instead of paying to use Facebook products. Since 28 January 2020, Facebook has provided the \n\n[Or. 9] ‘off-Facebook activity’ (‘OFA’) tool worldwide. Facebook users can use the tool to view a summary of the information obtained by Facebook about their activities on other websites and apps and disconnect these data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish. \n\nII. \n\nThe provisions of German law relevant to the assessment of the appeal proceedings are worded as follows: \n\nParagraph 19(1) of the GWB, in the version in force until 18 January 2021: \n\n(1) The abusive exploitation of a dominant position by one or more undertakings is prohibited. \n\nParagraph 19(1) of the GWB, in the version in force since 19 January 2021: \n\n(1) \tThe abuse of a dominant position by one or more undertakings is prohibited. Paragraph 32(1) of the GWB: \n\n(1) The competition authority may require undertakings or associations of undertakings to bring to an end an infringement of a provision of this Part or of Articles 101 or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\nIII. \n\nThe success of Facebook Ireland’s appeal – which, following the withdrawal of the Masquerade service and the Federal Cartel Office’s statement that it no longer derives any rights from the contested decision in that regard, is directed only against the remainder of the decision – depends on the answers to the preliminary questions raised in the operative part of the decision. Consequently, before deciding on the substance of the appeal, the proceedings must be stayed and a preliminary ruling obtained from the Court of Justice of the European Union under Article 267 TFEU. \n\n1. First of all, the Federal Cartel Office based its order under Paragraphs 19(1) and 32 of the GWB solely on the ground that the processing of data from the group services provided separately from Facebook.com, and from Facebook Business Tools, as set out in the terms of service and implemented, constitutes the abusive exploitation of a dominant position on the market for social networks for private users in Germany, in the form of an abuse of terms under the general provision that is Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB, [Or. 10] because such processing is a result of market power and therefore breaches the GDPR, since it lacks sufficient justification under Article 6(1) and Article 9(2) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the abuse creates an impediment to the detriment of competitors on the social networks market and on third markets. An additional assessment of the balance of interests with regard to competition is superfluous and would in any case lead to the same result as the assessment with regard to data protection interests. Since the concept of protection developed in the German case-law in relation to the general provision of Article 19(1) of the GWB has as yet no counterpart in European case-law or in practice, the decision is based solely on Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB, which is stricter in that regard than Article 102 TFEU. \n\nWhile the order of the Federal Cartel Office must be annulled in so far as it is directed against the first and third applicants and all of their associated undertakings in accordance with Paragraph 36(2) of the GWB, since the latter were not involved in the administrative proceedings and were not given a hearing, and since the order does not include any discretionary consideration of the grounds for involving the first and third applicants, and the discretion required under Paragraph 32(1) of the GWB may not be exercised for the first time in the appeal proceedings, the Chamber will proceed, with respect to Facebook Ireland, on the basis of the following considerations: \n\na)\tFacebook Ireland is dominant on the relevant market for the provision of digital social networks for private users which, for the purposes of monitoring abuse, can be defined as national since, according to the uncontested findings of the Federal Cartel Office, its network effects are confined primarily to Germany; it is therefore Facebook Ireland that is addressed by Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB. \n\nb)\tA breach of the GDPR by Facebook Ireland’s terms of service and their implementation may constitute an abuse of terms detrimental to private users under the general provision of Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB, since that paragraph, like Article 102 TFEU, protects consumers not only indirectly from distortion of the rules of competition through market power, but also directly from exploitation by a dominant undertaking, while having no impact on the structure of competition (see judgment of 15 March 2007, British Airways, C-95/04, paragraph 106, available from JURIS; Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice; ‘the BGH’), [Or. 11] judgment of 7 December 2010, Entega II, KZR 5/10, paragraph 55, available from JURIS). This harms competition by infringing the right of users, protected by the GDPR, to control their personal data. A comparative market analysis and determination of a substantial deviation from the comparative conditions, such as would be carried out to establish an abusively excessive price within the meaning of Paragraph 19(2)(2) of the GWB, are not undertaken if the alleged abusive conduct is a relevant breach of the law (see BGH, judgment of 6 November 2013, VBL-Gegenwert I, KZR 58/11, paragraph 66, available from JURIS). Nor is there any scope for the assessment of the balance of interests also required under the general provision of \n\nParagraph 19(1) of the GWB (see BGH, judgment of 7 June 2016, Pechstein v \n\n\tInternational \tSkating \tUnion, \tKZR 6/15 \n\n[ECLI:DE:BGH:2016:070616UKZR6.15.0], paragraph 48, available from JURIS). The causal link between abuse and market power required under Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB and the first sentence of Article 102 TFEU (see judgment of 14 November 1996, Tetra Pak, C-333/94 [EU:C:1996:436], paragraph 27, available from JURIS; judgment of 14 February 1978, United Brands, C-27/76, [EU:C:1978:22], paragraph 248/257, available from JURIS; \n\n\tBGH, \tdecision \tof \t23 June \t2020, \tFacebook, \tKVR 69/19 \n\n\t[ECLI:DE:BGH:2020:230620BKVR69.19.0] \tparagraph 73, \tavailable \tfrom \n\nJURIS) exists, both in terms of behavioural causality in the broader sense, since, if competition were functioning effectively it would not be advisable for Facebook Ireland to insist on conditions for data processing operations that are not permitted under the GDPR, and also in terms of the causality of results, since, although the GDPR can also be breached by undertakings that are not in a dominant position, users have scarcely any alternative when it is breached by an undertaking with a virtual monopoly, such as Facebook Ireland (see also judgments of 5 October 1988, Alsatel, C-247/86 [EU:C:1988:469], available from JURIS and of 27 March 1974, BRT and SABAM, C-127/73 [EU:C:1974:25], available from JURIS, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union does not question the connection between abuse and market power). If abuse is demonstrated, Facebook Ireland cannot rely on a group privilege under Paragraph 36(2) of the GWB (see judgment of 24 October 1996, Viho, C-73/95 P, paragraph 17, available from JURIS; BGH, decision of 6 November 2012, Gasversorgung Ahrensburg, KVR 54/11, paragraphs 19 and 22, available from JURIS; judgment of 23 June 2009, Entega I, KZR 21/08, paragraph 16, available from JURIS). \n\nc)\tThe order is unlawful on procedural grounds since, contrary to the second sentence of Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty [Or. 12] (the Implementing Regulation), the Federal Cartel Office did not examine the first paragraph of Article 102 TFEU, although Facebook Ireland’s dominant position in Germany corresponds to a dominant position on a substantial part of the internal market within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 102 TFEU (see judgment of 23 April 1991, Höfner-Elsner, C-41/90, paragraph 28, available from JURIS; judgment of 9 November 1983, Michelin, C-322/81 [EU:C:1983:313], paragraph 28, available from JURIS) and in view of the finding that the breach of the GDPR entails ‘actual and potential impediments to the detriment of competitors’ (paragraph 885 of the Office’s decision), the requirement under the first paragraph of Article 102 TFEU that trade between Member States be affected should also have been assumed to apply (see judgment of 23 April 1991, Höfner-Elsner, C-41/90, paragraph 32, available from JURIS; judgment of 9 November 1983, Michelin, C-322/81 \n\n[EU:C:1983:313], paragraph 104, available from JURIS). […] [amplification] Since […] it must be assumed that Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB and the first paragraph of Article 102 TFEU are consistent with each other (see BGH, judgment of 8 April 2014 VBL-Versicherungspflicht, KZR 53/12, paragraph 46, available from JURIS; judgment of 6 November 2013, VBL-Gegenwert I, KZR 58/11, paragraph 51, available from JURIS), the procedural error is, however, irrelevant if the order is lawful under Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB and, if it is unlawful under Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB, does not lead to any further significant contraventions. \n\nd)\tThat being the case, can the Federal Cartel Office determine whether Facebook Ireland’s terms of service and their implementation breach the GDPR, and impose measures to remedy that breach? [Or. 13] \n\naa)\tQuestion 1. a) of the request for a preliminary ruling seeks to clarify whether it is compatible with the competence, cooperation and consistency provisions of Article 51 et seq., and in particular Article 56(1), of the GDPR and the provisions in relation to powers of Articles 57 and 58 of the GDPR that, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, the Federal Cartel Office should determine that Facebook Ireland’s terms of service and their implementation breach the GDPR and order measures to remedy that breach. The Federal Cartel Office is not a supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR, and the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) of the GDPR is the Irish supervisory authority, since Facebook Ireland is Facebook’s main establishment in Europe, operates the social network in Europe, uses standard terms of service in all Member States of the European Union and is the controller for the processing of personal data for the entire territory of the European Union within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR. \n\nIn so far as the possibility of civil-law protection under Article 82 of the GDPR and, in particular, other penalties under Article 84(1) of the GDPR must also be taken into consideration in that context, the Chamber notes that Paragraphs 19 and 32 of the GWB are not among the provisions notified by Germany to the European Commission as required by Article 84(2) of the GDPR (paragraph 201 of the statement of grounds of appeal). \n\nbb)\tIf it is compatible with the competence rules of the GDPR that, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, the Federal Cartel Office determine that the terms of service and their implementation breach the GDPR and that it impose a penalty for that breach, Question 1. b) of the request seeks to clarify whether that is compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) TEU, if the lead supervisory authority under Article 56(1) of the GDPR is already examining that infringement, as in the case here of the Irish supervisory authority, which, according to Facebook’s uncontested submission (paragraphs 188 and 217 of the statement of grounds of appeal), was already cooperating with other relevant supervisory authorities in the Union on an ongoing examination of a possible infringement of the GDPR by Facebook Ireland at the time of the Office’s decision. \n\ne) If the Federal Cartel Office can determine, for the purposes of monitoring abuses of competition law, that Facebook Ireland’s terms of service and their implementation breach the GDPR and order measures to remedy that breach, [Or. 14] do the terms of service (as further set out in the data and cookies policies) in relation to the processing of data from other group services and Facebook Business Tools (together also: ‘off-Facebook data’) and their implementation breach the GDPR, and can the Federal Cartel Office prohibit the terms of service and their implementation and order that the data may not be processed or may be processed only with the separate consent of users, to which the use of Facebook.com may not be made subject? \n\naa) The Federal Cartel Office rightly assumes that off-Facebook data are personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR (see judgment of 19 October 2016, Breyer, C-582/14, paragraph 49, available from JURIS; judgment of 24 November 2011, Scarlet, C-70/10, paragraph 51, available from \n\nJURIS; BGH, reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union of \n\n\t5 October \t2017, \tCookie-Einwilligung \tI, \tI \tZR \t7/16, \n\n[ECLI:DE:BGH:2017:051017BIZR7.16.0], paragraph 23, available from JURIS), that the data are used to personalise the network, that the advertising constitutes ‘profiling’ within the meaning of Article 4(4) of the GDPR and that Facebook Ireland is the data processing controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR (see judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion ID, C-40/17 [EU:C:2019:629], paragraph 84, available from JURIS). \n\nbb)\tThe Federal Cartel Office rightly assumes that – even in the light of point 2 of the new terms of service of 31 July 2019 – users do not consent to the processing of off-Facebook data in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR by clicking on the ‘Sign up’ button (see judgment of 1 October 2019, Planet49, C-673/17 [EU:C:2019:801], paragraph 58 et seq.), and that the consent that Facebook Ireland obtains from users to the use of data from Facebook Business Tools to show personalised advertisements relates only to the use of the data for that purpose and not to the collection and linking of those data with the user’s Facebook.com account in general. The Federal Cartel Office also rightly assumes that the possibility of blocking the placement of cookies on the user’s device or web browser, or deleting them, the possibility of resetting advertising IDs in a mobile device’s operating system and the OFA function introduced at the end of January 2020 do not fulfil the requirements for consent under Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. [Or. 15] \n\ncc)\tSince the processing of off-Facebook data, as provided for in the terms of service – including within the group – is lawful if it is justified by at least one of the grounds under Article 6(1)(a) to (f) of the GDPR, and the Court of Justice has already ruled that the identical provision of Article 7 of the preceding Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) provides an exhaustive and conclusive list of cases in which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful and that Member States may neither introduce new principles for the lawful processing of personal data alongside this Article, nor impose additional conditions which would alter the scope of any of the principles provided for therein (see judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion Id, C-40/17 [EU:C:2019:629], paragraph 55, available from JURIS; judgment of 19 October 2016, Breyer, C-582/14, paragraph 57, available from JURIS; judgment of 24 November 2011, ASNEF and FECEMD, C-468/10 and C-469/10, paragraphs 30 and 32, available from JURIS), is the processing of off-Facebook data as provided for in the terms of service only ever justifiable if consent is obtained? For only then could the Federal Cartel Office order that, for data protection reasons, such data may not be processed or may be processed only if consent is given . \n\n(1) According to point 1 (‘The services we provide’) of its current terms of service (Annex Bf 9), the following contractual services relevant to this case are provided by Facebook Ireland as part of its social network: 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook’s products. \n\nFacebook Ireland collects the user- and device-related data listed in its Data \n\nPolicy (Annex Bf 10) under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ from the use of its group services and from Facebook Business Tools; it links these data with the data collected and stored while Facebook.com is being used and, according to the section headed ‘How do we use this information?’, uses it to provide, personalise and improve its products, to provide measurement, analytics and other business services, to promote safety, integrity and security, to communicate with users and to research and innovate for social good; according to the [Or. 16] section headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’, it also uses it ‘across the Facebook Companies.’ \n\nAccording to its Cookies Policy (Annex Bf 11), Facebook Ireland sets cookies or uses other storage technologies when users use the group’s services and visit third-party websites and apps that have integrated Facebook Business Tools, and collects user- and device-related data without any further action by the user; it uses those data to provide its services and for security, advertising and analytics purposes. \n\nThe kinds of data collected and used are detailed in the Data Policy under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ (Annex Bf 10) and in point 2(a) to (d) of the operative part of the Office’s decision. \n\nFacebook Ireland relies in the section of its Data Policy headed ‘What is our legal basis for processing data?’(Annex Bf 10) on all of the grounds under Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Under the heading ‘Learn more about these legal bases’ (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR 1. for processing data with special protections that are provided by users in their Facebook.com profile, for sharing with persons they choose and to personalise content, 2. for using facial recognition technology, 3. for using data that advertisers and other partners provide about users’ activity off Facebook Company Products to personalise advertising, 4. for sharing data that personally identifies users with advertisers, 5. for collecting information that users allow Facebook to receive through the device-based settings they enable (GPS location, camera, photos). Facebook Ireland obtains separate consent from users to process their data for these purposes or offers them the chance to object (in the case of facial recognition). \n\nIn the document referred to (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on the justification of necessity for the performance of the contract within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR 1. to provide, personalise and improve its products, 2. to promote safety, integrity and security, 3. to [Or. 17] transfer and transmit data outside the EEA, 4. to communicate with users, 5. to provide consistent and seamless experiences across all Facebook Company Products. \n\nFacebook Ireland relies on the justification of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR 1. vis-à-vis minors, 2. for providing measurement, analytics and other business services, 3. for providing marketing communications, 4. to research and innovate for social good, 5. to share information with others including law enforcement agencies and to respond to legal requests. \n\nFacebook Ireland further relies on the justification of compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR), the protection of vital interests (Article 6(1)(d) of the GDPR) and tasks carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) (see Annex Bf 12 for detailed information). \n\n(2) Consent would be required if and in so far as the collection and linking of data with the Facebook.com account and the use of off-Facebook data involved the processing of special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR and no permission other than consent under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR could be given. \n\n(a)\tQuestion 2. a) of the request seeks to clarify whether, as the Federal Cartel Office believes (paragraph 584 et seq. of its decision), the use of Facebook Business Tools, cookies and other storage technologies to collect data about visits to third-party websites and apps and/or the linking of those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and/or the use of those data involves the processing of sensitive data for the purpose of Article 9(1) of the GDPR if those websites and apps are covered by the criteria of that provision, such as flirting apps, gay dating sites, political party websites and health-related websites (paragraph 587 of the Office’s decision). \n\nIn that regard, is it sufficient for the data to relate to visits to the website or app alone, or must the user also have entered certain information, for example by registering or placing orders, and how should the terms ‘data revealing …’ within the meaning of the first data category and ‘data’ within the meaning of the second data category of Article 9(1) of the GDPR be interpreted [Or. 18]? The formulation of the first data category of Article 9(1) of the GDPR (‘data revealing …’) might support the argument that the processing of the ‘source data’, in other words visits to a website or the information entered by the user, is prohibited, and it is therefore a matter of determining when this ‘reveals’ sensitive data. Since, by contrast, the second data category of Article 9(1) of the GDPR appears to prohibit only the processing of sensitive data, can visits to relevant websites or the entry of information by the user in themselves be regarded as sensitive data, even though the distinction is further qualified, by the legal definition in Article 4(15) of the GDPR, for example, which states that data concerning health can also be data which ‘reveal’ information about a person’s health status. The question also seeks to clarify whether the purpose for which the data are used – in this case, for example, to personalise the social network and advertising, for network security, to improve services, to provide measurement and analytics services for advertising partners, to research for social good, to respond to legal requests and comply with legal obligations, to protect the vital interests of users and third parties and to carry out tasks in the public interest – is also relevant to the assessment. \n\n(b)\tQuestion 2.b) of the request seeks to clarify, with regard to sensitive data for the purpose of Article 9(1) of the GDPR, whether the user has manifestly made those data public by visiting the website or app and/or entering information and/or clicking or tapping on the buttons provided by Facebook Ireland and integrated into the websites or apps, such as the social plugins (Like, Share) or Facebook Login or Account Kit (Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR), since he or she would then have lost the specific protection of Article 9(1) of the GDPR without any need for consent under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. In view of the sector in which Facebook operates, the other grounds for permission under Article 9(2) of the GDPR do not apply, or at least are not claimed by Facebook or referred to in its terms of service. \n\n(3)\tWhere Facebook Ireland also uses cookies and similar storage technologies to collect data from users’ devices when they use the other group services and visit websites and apps in which Facebook Business Tools have been integrated, Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the [Or. 19] electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) also applies. Since, as the Federal Court of Justice ruled, the GDPR does not affect the application of this provision, the first sentence of Paragraph 15(3) of the Telemediengesetz (Law on telemedia), which implements Directive 2002/58/EC, still applies and must be interpreted in accordance with the directive as meaning that the user’s consent is required for the use of cookies to produce user profiles for the purposes of advertising or market research (see BGH, judgment of 28 May 2020, Cookie-Einwilligung II, I ZR 7/16, paragraph 47 et seq., available from JURIS; see also judgment of 1 October 2019, Planet49, C-673/17 [ECLI: EU:C:2019:801], paragraph 38 et seq., available from JURIS; judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion ID, C-40/17 [EU:C:2019:629], paragraph 88 et seq., available from JURIS). However, the question whether the consent obtained for the use of partner data to show personalised advertisements is adequate for this is of no further relevance here, since the Federal Cartel Office based its finding that Facebook had breached the prohibition on the competitionlaw abuse laid down in Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB only on a breach, by Facebook’s data processing operations, of the GDPR, and not on a breach of the first sentence of Paragraph 15(3) of the Law on telemedia. \n\n(4)\tIf and in so far as consent is not required under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR – in other words, for the processing of data from the other group services, with regard to which the Federal Cartel Office did not find any evidence of the processing of potentially sensitive data for the purpose of Article 9(1) of the GDPR, and the processing of non-sensitive data from Facebook Business Tools or data which have manifestly been made public by the user – can Facebook Ireland rely on other justifications under Article 6(1) of the GDPR for the processing of off-Facebook data, and, if so, to what extent? The Chamber assumes that, where data are manifestly made public within the meaning of Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, only the prohibition under paragraph 1 of that provision ceases to apply, and not the requirement for a justification under Article 6(1) of the GDPR (see the fifth sentence of recital 51). \n\n(a) Question 3 of the request seeks to clarify whether, when Facebook Ireland, as referred to above, offers 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products as contractual services, it can rely on the justification of necessity for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, or on the [Or. 20] justification of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, if it collects off-Facebook data for these purposes, links those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and uses them. \n\nThe Chamber believes that there is much in the case-law of the Court of Justice with regard to necessity (see judgment of 4 May 2017, Rigas satiksme, C-13/16, paragraph 30, available from JURIS) and the factors taken into consideration by the European Data Protection Board in its Guidelines 2/19 (paragraphs 2, 26 et seq., 48 et seq. and 57, Annex Bf 42B) to support the view that the processing of data for the purposes of personalised advertising, which does not require cookies, of user and network security and of product improvement, can certainly be regarded as being in the legitimate interests of the undertaking; the case-law also appears to suggest that the processing of data to personalise content and, in some cases, also to ensure the consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products can be regarded as necessary for the performance of Facebook Ireland’s contracts. \n\nAccordingly, Facebook Ireland could have a legitimate interest, for example, in processing WhatsApp data for user and network security because, as it states in the section of the Data Policy headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’ (Annex Bf 10), it uses information from WhatsApp accounts sending spam to take action against those accounts on Facebook.com, although this is otherwise neither necessary for the performance of the contract nor likely to be justified by other legitimate interests, since Facebook Ireland does not use WhatsApp data for product and personalisation purposes on Facebook.com (paragraph 746 of the Office’s decision). \n\nThe processing of Instagram data for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products (so that users can be shown people or content on Facebook.com that might also be of interest to them there) could be necessary for the performance of the contract or at least be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. Facebook Ireland could also have a legitimate interest in processing these data for the purposes of personalised advertising, network security and product improvement. In particular, by its own account, Facebook Ireland uses Instagram data from accounts that behave inappropriately or are clearly involved in unlawful activity to ensure the security of Facebook users [Or. 21] (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal). In principle, the same could apply to the processing of Oculus data, although there are not yet enough findings on the specific purposes for which those data are used on Facebook.com. \n\nThe processing of data from Facebook Business Tools, particularly the social plugins Like and Share, and from Facebook Login and Account Kit could be necessary for the performance of the contract, or at least in Facebook Ireland’s legitimate interests, provided it is intended for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products. This should require the user to click or tap on the relevant button and should be limited to the data processing operations required in a particular case. Irrespective of whether or not the user has clicked or tapped on the buttons, the collection of data and the linking of those data with the Facebook.com account could be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland if the user has consented to the use of the data for the display of personalised advertisements. Data processing for the purposes of network security or product improvement could also be legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. By its own account, Facebook uses data from social plugins to identify rapidly, from the many website visits, attempts by bots to open and operate Facebook accounts (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal). \n\n\t(b) \tQuestion 4 of the request seeks to clarify whether \n\n–\tthe fact of users being underage, vis-à-vis the personalisation of content and advertising, product improvement, network security and non-marketing communications with the user; \n\n–\tthe provision of measurements, analytics and other business services to enable advertisers, developers and other partners to evaluate and improve their services; \n\n–\tthe provision of marketing communications to the user to enable Facebook Ireland to improve its products and engage in direct marketing; \n\n–\tresearch and innovation for social good, to further the state of the art or the academic understanding of important social issues and to affect society and the world in a positive way; \n\n–\tthe sharing of information with law enforcement agencies and responding to legal requests in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, unlawful use, breaches of the terms of service and policies and other harmful behaviour; \n\n[Or. 22]  \n\nmay constitute legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR with regard to the collection of off-Facebook data for these purposes, the linking of those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and their use. \n\nIn particular, can Facebook Ireland rely on the justification of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR for the processing of data obtained from other group services and from Facebook Business Tools in the case of minors who have not yet reached the age of 16 required in order to give independent consent under Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR (Article 8(1) of the GDPR) – no provision having been made in Germany for a lower age pursuant to the third sentence of Article 8(1) of the GDPR – who do not have parental consent and who the German commentaries (apparently unanimously) believe to be unable to enter independently into a valid contract within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR with a social network for the use of its services, since it does not involve only a legal benefit on account of the processing of the data (Paragraph 107 of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (German Civil Code, ‘the BGB’); see Klumpp in: Staudinger, BGB, Revised edition 2017, ‘§ 107’, paragraph 30; Spickhoff in: MüKoBGB, 8th edition 2018, ‘§ 107’, paragraph 82; Mansel in: Jauernig, BGB, 18th edition 2021, ‘§ 107’, paragraph 3)? \n\nIt also appears doubtful whether the processing of off-Facebook data can be justified by the interests of research and innovation for social good, to further the state of the art or the academic understanding of important social issues and to affect society and the world in a positive way. \n\nThe use of data from Facebook Business Tools to provide measurement, analytics and other business services to enable advertisers, developers and other partners to evaluate and improve their services could, by contrast, be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland (and its partners) if users have consented to the use of partner data for the display of personalised advertisements. If, and in so far as, the processing of data from the other group services and/or Facebook Business Tools is justified for the purposes of product improvement, this could also apply to its use for the provision of marketing communications to the user to enable Facebook to improve its products and engage in direct marketing. [Or. 23] \n\nSimilarly, collecting those data, linking them with the Facebook.com account and using them, or using off-Facebook data already collected and linked by other lawful means to share information with law enforcement agencies and to respond to legal requests in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, unauthorised use, breaches of the terms of service and policies and other harmful behaviour could be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. \n\nThe fact that third-party providers that have integrated Facebook Business Tools into their websites can wait until they have obtained the user’s consent before transmitting data to Facebook Ireland (paragraph 868 of the Office’s decision) and that, since 28 January 2020, Facebook has provided the OFA function, which allows Facebook.com users to view a summary of the information Facebook receives about their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect information about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish, should perhaps also be taken into account here, in addition to the legal right to object under Article 21 of the GDPR (paragraphs 148 and 149 of the statement of grounds of appeal). \n\n(c) Question 5 of the request seeks to clarify whether collecting those data, linking them with the Facebook.com account and using them, or using offFacebook data already collected and linked by other lawful means, can be justified in individual cases under Article 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the GDPR, in order, for example, to respond to a legitimate request for certain data (point (c)), to combat harmful behaviour and promote security (point (d)), to research for social good and to promote safety, integrity and security (point(e)) as Facebook Ireland claims in Annex Bf 12, since, even then, the processing of those data cannot always, without exception, be made conditional on the user’s consent, or whether any justification for processing off-Facebook data for these reasons can generally be ruled out. \n\nf)\tIf the data processing policies and their implementation are unlawful or unjustified, the question whether they also constitute an exclusionary abuse for the purposes of the general provision of Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB [Or. 24] to the detriment of competitors on the market for social networks for private users or on other markets would no longer be relevant. \n\ng)\tIf, and in so far as, the processing of off-Facebook data can only be justified by consent, Question 6 seeks to clarify whether it is actually possible for users to give effective consent within the meaning of Articles 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) of the GDPR to a dominant undertaking such as Facebook Ireland, as required by the Federal Cartel Office in its order to remedy the alleged breach, or whether the requirement under Article 4(11) of the GDPR for consent to be given freely can never be met vis-à-vis a dominant undertaking, even when performance of the contract does not depend on consent to the processing of data. This might be suggested by the first sentence of recital 43. \n\n2. Clarification of the questions referred is not rendered superfluous by the fact that the Federal Cartel Office based its order in the appeal proceedings ‘additionally’ (sentence 88 of the statement of defence) on the grounds of the Federal Court of Justice’s decision in the preceding summary proceedings (Decision of 23 June 2020 KVR 69/19, available from JURIS – Facebook [ECLI:DE:BGH:2020:230620BKVR69.19.0]), according to which the processing of user data from other group services and Facebook Business Tools imposes additional services on Facebook.com users, which they ‘may not want’; the terms of service objected to would not be imposed if competition were functioning effectively, but are likely to impede competition and, after a comprehensive assessment of the balance of interests, the additional services are considered to be abusive, particularly as they cannot not be justified under the GDPR. The order cannot be upheld on these grounds, largely because the Federal Cartel Office’s findings did not provide the required evidence that the data processing operations are likely to impede competition. This could be considered a serious possibility only with regard to the processing of Instagram data; however Question 7, and possibly Questions 3 to 5, of the request must be clarified before a decision can be made on that point. \n\na)\tSince the Federal Court of Justice appears to assume that the Federal Cartel Office can include this justification in its order [Or. 25] in the appeal proceedings, although the allegation of abuse would then be based on facts other than a breach of the GDPR and the user consent required in the operative part would therefore not be consent within the meaning of the GDPR, but a different consent, possibly in addition to the consent to be granted under the GDPR, the Chamber will also take account of this justification in its examination of the order. \n\nb)\tThe Federal Cartel Office has, however, largely failed to make the necessary determination in respect of the requirement that the processing of off-Facebook data must be likely to impede competition. This would require evidence of a potentially anti-competitive effect – on the network market; on the network itself, because of increased network effects or product improvement, for example; on advertising, because of the detailed data held; or on advertising markets or third markets (regardless of how they are defined in individual cases) – while the practice of an undertaking in a dominant position cannot be characterised as abusive in the absence of any anti-competitive effect on the market (see judgment of 6 December 2012, Astra Zeneca, C-457/10 P, paragraph 112, available from JURIS ; judgment of 17 February 2011, TeliaSonera, C-52/09, paragraph 64, available from JURIS ). \n\nSince Facebook Ireland does not use the WhatsApp data of Facebook.com users on Facebook.com for personalisation and product purposes, and, by its own account, does not intend to do so in Europe either, it is not clear, and has not been established by the Federal Cartel Office, that the processing of WhatsApp data could in any way impede competition on the network market, on an advertising market or on a market for Messenger services. Nor has the Federal Cartel Office determined the extent to which Oculus data of Facebook.com users are used for the purposes of the Facebook.com network and would be likely to impede competition on the network market, on a relevant advertising market or on the market on which Oculus is provided. The processing of data from Facebook Business Tools ‘may’ really only ‘not be wanted’ by Facebook.com users who do not click or tap on the social plugins (Like, Share), do not use Facebook Login or Account Kit and have not consented to be shown personalised advertisements. However, the Federal Cartel Office has also failed to establish the extent to which data from Facebook Business Tools that are processed for purposes other than the personalisation of Facebook.com, the seamless use of Facebook products and [Or. 26] to show personalised advertisements, are likely to impede competition on the network market, on an advertising market or on third markets, particularly as users can also use the OFA function to disconnect these data from their Facebook account. \n\nc)\tOnly the processing of the Instagram data of Facebook.com users is really likely to impede competition, because it is used to personalise Facebook.com by suggesting people whom users follow on Instagram to them and, in that respect, can increase the network effects, and because it is used on Facebook.com in conjunction with the user’s Facebook.com data, for example, for advertising purposes and for product improvement. The answer to the question whether data would be processed across services in this way, without the separate consent of users, if there were effective competition on the social networks market and, in particular, the comprehensive assessment of the balance of the interests required to establish whether Facebook Ireland’s conduct is abusive in terms of both user exploitation and restriction of competition (see BGH, decision of 23 June 2020, Facebook, KVR 69/19 [ECLI:DE:BGH:2020:230620BKVR69.19.0], paragraph \n\n98 et seq. available from JURIS) hinges on whether the Federal Cartel Office can establish that the processing of data, at least for this purpose, breaches the GDPR, which Question 7 seeks to clarify, and, furthermore, whether it breaches the GDPR because Facebook Ireland uses methods different from those governing normal competition between products or services on the basis of supplies by economic operators, which Questions 3 to 5 seek to clarify (see judgment of 6 October 2015, Post Danmark, C-23/14, paragraph 29 et seq.; judgment of 6 December 2012, Astra Zeneca, C-457/10, paragraphs 74 and 75, available from JURIS). \n\n[…] \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.911788487Z","tags":null},"/Actually-relevant/Structure":{"title":"","content":"\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n```ad-important\nProcessing must be for:\n\t- 'Proper'\n\t- Performance\n\t- Contract between DS and DC\n\n**And** DC must prove that\n\t- Not merely useful\n\t-\"main subject matter\" CANNOT be achieved\n```\n\n\n1.

In accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT, the contracting parties undertook to ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other contracting party and not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of those investments. In accordance with Article 4 of the BIT, each contracting party guaranteed the free transfer in a freely convertible currency without undue restriction or delay of payments relating to an investment, such as profits, interest and dividends.\n\n4\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT provides:\n\n‘1.   All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if, possible, be settled amicably.\n\n2.   Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.\n\n3.   The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article will be constituted for each individual case in the following way: each party to the dispute appoints one member of the tribunal and the two members thus appointed shall select a national of a third State as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute shall appoint its member of the tribunal within two months, and the Chairman shall be appointed within three months from the date on which the investor has notified the other Contracting Party of his decision to submit the dispute to the arbitral tribunal.\n\n4.   If the appointments have not been made in the abovementioned periods, either party to the dispute may invite the President of the Arbitration Institute of the Chamber of Commerce of Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the most senior member of the Arbitration Institute who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.\n\n5.   The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules.\n\n6.   The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n–\n\nthe law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n–\n\nthe provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n–\n\nthe provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n–\n\nthe general principles of international law.\n\n7.   The tribunal takes its decision by majority of votes; such decision shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.’\n\nGerman law\n\n5\n\nUnder Paragraph 1059(2) of the Zivilprozessordnung (Code of Civil Procedure), an arbitral award can be set aside only if one of the grounds set out in that provision is present, which include the arbitration agreement being invalid under the law to which the parties have subjected it, and the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award being contrary to public policy.\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n6\n\nOn 1 January 1993 the Slovak Republic, as a successor State to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, succeeded to the rights and obligations of that State under the BIT, and on 1 May 2004 it acceded to the European Union.\n\n7\n\nAs part of a reform of its health system, the Slovak Republic opened the Slovak market in 2004 to national operators and those of other Member States offering private sickness insurance services. Achmea, an undertaking belonging to a Netherlands insurance group, after obtaining authorisation as a sickness insurance institution, set up a subsidiary in Slovakia to which it contributed capital and through which it offered private sickness insurance services on the Slovak market.\n\n8\n\nIn 2006 the Slovak Republic partly reversed the liberalisation of the private sickness insurance market. In particular, by a law of 25 October 2007, it prohibited the distribution of profits generated by private sickness insurance activities. Subsequently, after the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic) held in a judgment of 26 January 2011 that the prohibition was contrary to the Slovak constitution, the Slovak Republic, by a law which entered into force on 1 August 2011, once more allowed the distribution of the profits in question.\n\n9\n\nSince it considered that the legislative measures of the Slovak Republic had caused it damage, Achmea brought arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic in October 2008 pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n10\n\nAs Frankfurt am Main (Germany) was chosen as the place of arbitration, German law applies to the arbitration proceedings concerned.\n\n11\n\nIn those arbitration proceedings the Slovak Republic raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. It submitted in that respect that, as a result of its accession to the European Union, recourse to an arbitral tribunal provided for in Article 8(2) of the BIT was incompatible with EU law. By an interlocutory arbitral award of 26 October 2010, the arbitral tribunal dismissed the objection. The applications for that award to be set aside brought by the Slovak Republic before the German courts were unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal.\n\n12\n\nBy arbitral award of 7 December 2012, the arbitral tribunal ordered the Slovak Republic to pay Achmea damages in the principal amount of EUR 22.1 million. The Slovak Republic brought an action to set aside that arbitral award before the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (Higher Regional Court, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). When that court dismissed the action, the Slovak Republic appealed on a point of law against the dismissal to the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany).\n\n13\n\nThe referring court notes that, since the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, the BIT has constituted an agreement between Member States, so that in the event of conflict the provisions of EU law take precedence, in the matters governed by them, over the provisions of the BIT.\n\n14\n\nThe Slovak Republic expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the arbitration clause in Article 8 of the BIT with Articles 18, 267 and 344 TFEU. Although the referring court does not share those doubts, it nonetheless considered that, since the Court has not yet ruled on those questions and the questions are of considerable importance because of the numerous bilateral investment treaties still in force between Member States which contain similar arbitration clauses, it was necessary to make the present reference to the Court in order to decide the case before it.\n\n15\n\nIn the first place, the referring court doubts that Article 344 TFEU is even applicable. To begin with, the subject matter and purpose of that provision show that, even if its wording does not make this clearly apparent, it does not concern disputes between an individual and a Member State.\n\n16\n\nNext, the subject matter of Article 344 TFEU is confined to disputes relating to the interpretation and application of the Treaties. The dispute in the main proceedings is not such a case, however, as the arbitral award of 7 December 2012 was made on the basis of the BIT alone.\n\n17\n\nFinally, the purpose of Article 344 TFEU is to safeguard the allocation of powers laid down by the Treaties, and hence the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court, and at the same time it is a specific manifestation of the duty of the Member States to cooperate with the Court within the meaning of Article 4(3) TEU. It cannot, however, be concluded from that that Article 344 TFEU safeguards the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to any dispute in which EU law may be applied or interpreted. That provision in fact protects the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court only to the extent that the Member States have to make use of the procedures before the Court laid down by the Treaties. Yet a dispute such as that in the main proceedings cannot be resolved in proceedings before the EU judicature. The Treaties make no provision for any judicial procedure in which an investor such as Achmea can bring a claim, before the EU judicature, for compensation from a Member State under a bilateral investment treaty such as the BIT.\n\n18\n\nIn the second place, the referring court questions whether Article 267 TFEU precludes an arbitration clause such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n19\n\nIt observes, first, that the arbitration procedure is not in itself capable of ensuring the uniform application of EU law that Article 267 TFEU aims to guarantee. Even though, under Article 8(6) of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal had to comply with EU law and, in the event of conflict, apply it in priority, it would not have the possibility of making a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling, however, since it could not be regarded as a ‘court or tribunal’ within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.\n\n20\n\nThe referring court considers, next, that the uniform interpretation of EU law could nonetheless be regarded as being ensured in the present case, in that, prior to enforcement of the arbitral award, a court of the State may be called on to review the compatibility of the arbitral award with EU law, and can make a reference to the Court if need be. Further, in accordance with Paragraph 1059(2)(2)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, one of the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award is that its recognition or enforcement would be contrary to public policy. In line with the Court’s rulings on arbitral awards deciding disputes between individuals, the national courts’ power of review of an arbitral award concerning a dispute between an individual and a Member State can validly be limited solely to breaches of fundamental provisions of EU law. That circumstance should not lead to an arbitration clause such as that at issue in the main proceedings being contrary to Article 267 TFEU.\n\n21\n\nThe referring court adds, finally, that the Court has previously held that an international agreement providing for the establishment outside the institutional and judicial framework of the EU of a special court responsible for the interpretation and application of the provisions of that agreement is compatible with EU law in so far as there is no adverse effect on the autonomy of the EU legal order. The Court has not expressed reservations as to the creation of a judicial system that is designed, in essence, to resolve disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the actual provisions of the international agreement concerned and does not affect the powers of the courts and tribunals of the Member States in relation to the interpretation and application of EU law, nor the power, or indeed the obligation, of those courts and tribunals to request a preliminary ruling from the Court. The arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is called on precisely to rule on an infringement of the provisions of the BIT, which it must interpret in the light of EU law, in particular the provisions governing the free movement of capital.\n\n22\n\nIn the third place, the referring court notes that, unlike Netherlands or Slovak investors, those from Member States other than the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic are unable to bring proceedings before an arbitral tribunal instead of a court of the State, which represents a considerable disadvantage which may constitute discrimination contrary to Article 18 TFEU. However, the restriction by an intra-EU bilateral agreement of an advantage to nationals of the contracting Member States is discriminatory only if the nationals of other Member States who do not enjoy that advantage are in an objectively comparable situation. That is not so in the present case, since the fact that the reciprocal rights and obligations apply only to nationals of the two contracting Member States is a consequence that is inherent in the bilateral agreements concluded between them.\n\n23\n\nHaving regard to the above considerations, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘(1)\n\nDoes Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the investment protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?\n\nIf Question 1 is to be answered in the negative:\n\n(2)\n\nDoes Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision?\n\nIf Questions 1 and 2 are to be answered in the negative:\n\n(3)\n\nDoes the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision under the circumstances described in Question 1?’\n\nThe requests to have the written procedure reopened\n\n24\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Opinion of the Advocate General on 19 September 2017, the Czech, Hungarian and Polish Governments, by documents lodged at the Court Registry on 3 November, 19 and 16 October respectively, requested the reopening of the oral procedure pursuant to Article 83 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure.\n\n25\n\nIn support of their requests, those governments express their disagreement with the Advocate General’s Opinion.\n\n26\n\nHowever, first, the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice make no provision for the interested parties referred to in Article 23 of the Statute to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 22 June 2017, Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging and Others, [C‑126/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2017:489](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point30)).\n\n27\n\nSecondly, under the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU, the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, is to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which, in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, require the Advocate General’s involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s conclusion or by the reasoning which led to that conclusion. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions that he examines in his Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgment of 25 October 2017, Polbud — Wykonawstwo, [C‑106/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2017:804](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point24) and the case-law cited).\n\n28\n\nNevertheless, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in accordance with Article 83 of its Rules of Procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the interested persons (judgment of 22 June 2017, Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging and Others, [C‑126/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2017:489](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point33) and the case-law cited).\n\n29\n\nIn the present case, since the requests confine themselves to expressing the disagreement of the Czech, Hungarian and Polish Governments with the Opinion of the Advocate General and do not mention any new argument on the basis of which the present case should be decided, the Court considers, after hearing the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary elements to give judgment and that they need not be debated between the interested persons.\n\n30\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing, the requests for the oral procedure to be reopened must be rejected.\n\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\nQuestions 1 and 2\n\n31\n\nBy its first and second questions, which should be taken together, the referring court essentially asks whether Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\n32\n\nIn order to answer those questions, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court. That principle is enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties (Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, [EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [201](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point201) and the case-law cited).\n\n33\n\nAlso according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other (see, to that effect, Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, [EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [165](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point165) to [167](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point167) and the case-law cited).\n\n34\n\nEU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in Article 2 TEU. That premiss implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU (Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December

the case-law cited).\n\n35\n\nIn order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the autonomy of the EU legal order are preserved, the Treaties have established a judicial system intended to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of EU law (Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of

context, in accordance with Article 19 TEU, it is for the national courts and tribunals and the Court of Justice to ensure the full application of EU law in all Member States and to ensure judicial protection of the rights of individuals under that law (see, to that effect,

27 February 2018, Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses, [C‑64/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2018:117](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

the judicial system as thus conceived has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court and another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member States, has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties (Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, [EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [176](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point176) and the case-law cited).\n\n38\n\nThe first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling must be answered in the light of those considerations.\n\n39\n\nIt must be ascertained, first, whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.\n\n40\n\nEven if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the very broad wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT, is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.\n\n41\n\nGiven the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.\n\n42\n\nIt follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.\n\n43\n\nIt must therefore be ascertained, secondly, whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular whether it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU. The consequence of a tribunal set up by Member States being situated within the EU judicial system is that its decisions are subject to mechanisms capable of ensuring the full effectiveness of the rules of the EU (see, to that effect, Opinion [1/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026locale=en) (Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system) of 8 March 2011, [EU:C:2011:123](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [82](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point82) and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\nIn the case in which judgment was given on 12 June 2014, Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta ([C‑377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court derived the status of ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ of the tribunal in question from the fact that the tribunal as a whole was part of the system of judicial resolution of tax disputes provided for by the Portuguese constitution itself (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 June 2014, Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta, [C‑377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), paragraphs [25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point25) and [26](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point26)).\n\n45\n\nIn the case in the main proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is not part of the judicial system of the Netherlands or Slovakia. Indeed, it is precisely the exceptional nature of the tribunal’s jurisdiction compared with that of the courts of those two Member States that is one of the principal reasons for the existence of Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n46\n\nThat characteristic of the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings means that it cannot in any event be classified as a court or tribunal ‘of a Member State’ within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.\n\n47\n\nThe Court has indeed held that there is no good reason why a court common to a number of Member States, such as the Benelux Court of Justice, should not be able to submit questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling in the same way as the courts or tribunals of any one of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 November 1997, Parfums Christian Dior, [C‑337/95](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1997:517](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point21), and of 14 June 2011, Miles and Others, [C‑196/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:388](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40)).\n\n48\n\nHowever, the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is not such a court common to a number of Member States, comparable to the Benelux Court of Justice. Whereas the Benelux Court has the task of ensuring that the legal rules common to the three Benelux States are applied uniformly, and the procedure before it is a step in the proceedings before the national courts leading to definitive interpretations of common Benelux legal rules, the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings does not have any such links with the judicial systems of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 June 2011, Miles and Others, [C‑196/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:388](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [41](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point41)).\n\n49\n\nIt follows that a tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT cannot be regarded as a ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\n50\n\nIn those circumstances, it remains to be ascertained, thirdly, whether an arbitral award made by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.\n\n51\n\nIt should be noted that under Article 8(7) of the BIT the decision of the arbitral tribunal provided for in that article is final. Moreover, pursuant to Article 8(5) of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal is to determine its own procedure applying the UNCITRAL arbitration rules and, in particular, is itself to choose its seat and consequently the law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the award by which it puts an end to the dispute before it.\n\n52\n\nIn the present case, the arbitral tribunal applied to by Achmea chose to sit in Frankfurt am Main, which made German law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the arbitral award made by the tribunal on 7 December 2012. It was thus that choice which enabled the Slovak Republic, as a party to the dispute, to seek judicial review of the arbitral award, in accordance with German law, by bringing proceedings to that end before the competent German court.\n\n53\n\nHowever, such judicial review can be exercised by that court only to the extent that national law permits. Moreover, Paragraph 1059(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides only for limited review, concerning in particular the validity of the arbitration agreement under the applicable law and the consistency with public policy of the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award.\n\n54\n\nIt is true that, in relation to commercial arbitration, the Court has held that the requirements of efficient arbitration proceedings justify the review of arbitral awards by the courts of the Member States being limited in scope, provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can be examined in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling (see, to that effect, judgments of 1 June 1999, Eco Swiss, [C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [35](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point35), [36](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point36) and [40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40), and of 26 October 2006, Mostaza Claro, [C‑168/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2006:675](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34) to [39](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point39)).\n\n55\n\nHowever, arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT are different from commercial arbitration proceedings. While the latter originate in the freely expressed wishes of the parties, the former derive from a treaty by which Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence from the system of judicial remedies which the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered by EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 February 2018, Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses, [C‑64/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2018:117](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34)), disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of EU law. In those circumstances, the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph relating to commercial arbitration cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n56\n\nConsequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT and set out in paragraphs 39 to 55 above, it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.\n\n57\n\nIt is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected (see, to that effect, Opinion [1/91](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026locale=en) (EEA Agreement — I) of 14 December 1991, [EU:C:1991:490](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40) and [70](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point70); Opinion [1/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026locale=en) (Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system) of 8 March 2011, [EU:C:2011:123](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [74](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point74) and [76](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point76); and Opinion [2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en) (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, [EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [182](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point182) and [183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point183)).\n\n58\n\nIn the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.\n\n59\n\nIn those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.\n\n60\n\nConsequently, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\nQuestion 3\n\n61\n\nIn view of the answer to Questions 1 and 2, there is no need to answer Question 3.\n\nCosts\n\n62\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n \n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n \n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\n \n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n( [*1](#c-ECR_62016CJ0284_EN_01-E0001) ) Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.915788521Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Asturcom":{"title":"","content":"**Case C-40/08**\n\n**Asturcom Telecomunicaciones SL**\n\n**v**\n\n**Cristina Rodríguez Nogueira**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Juzgado de Primera Instancia nº 4 de Bilbao)\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC – Consumer contracts – Unfair arbitration clause – Measure void – Arbitration award which has become final – Enforcement – Whether the national court responsible for enforcement can consider of its own motion whether the unfair arbitration clause is null and void – Principles of equivalence and effectiveness)\n\nSummary of the Judgment\n\n_Approximation of laws – Unfair clauses in consumer contracts – Directive 93/13_\n\n_(Council Directive 93/13, Art. 6(1))_\n\nDirective 93/13 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature.

These include, as referred to at paragraph 1(q) of the Annex, terms which have the object or effect of ‘excluding or hindering the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy, particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not covered by legal provisions, unduly restricting the evidence available to him or imposing on him a burden of proof which, according to the applicable law, should lie with another party to the contract’.\n\n _National legislation_\n\n6        Under Spanish law, consumers were initially protected against unfair terms by Ley General 26/1984 para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios (General Law 26/1984 for the protection of consumers and users) of 19 July 1984 BOE No 176 of 24 July 1984) (‘Law 26/1984’).\n\n7        Law 26/1984 was amended by Ley 7/1998 sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contratación (Law 7/1998 on general contractual conditions) of 13 April 1998 (BOE No 89 of 14 April 1998) (‘Law 7/1998’), which transposed Directive 93/13 into national law.\n\n8        In particular, Law 7/1998 added to Law 26/1984 an Article 10a, the first paragraph of which provides that ‘[a]ll those terms not individually negotiated which, contrary to the requirement of good faith, cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer, shall be regarded as unfair terms. In any event, the terms listed in the first additional provision to this Law shall be regarded as unfair. …’.\n\n9        Article 8 of Law 7/1998 provides as follows:\n\n‘1.      General conditions which infringe the provisions of this Law or any other rule ordering or prohibiting certain conduct, to the detriment of a party to the contract, shall automatically be void, save in so far as they make separate provision for cases of breach.\n\n2.      In particular, general terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article 10a and the first additional provision of Law 26/1984 … shall be void.’\n\n10      At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, arbitration proceedings were governed by Ley 60/2003 de Arbitraje (Law 60/2003 on Arbitration) of 23 December 2003 (BOE No 309 of 26 December 2003) (‘Law 60/2003’).\n\n11      Article 8(4) and (5) of Law 60/2003 was worded as follows:\n\n‘4.      The court of first instance of the place in which the award was made shall have jurisdiction to hear an action for enforcement of the award in accordance with Article 545(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure …\n\n5.      An action for annulment of the arbitration award shall be brought before the Audiencia Provincial [Provincial Court] of the place in which the award was made.’\n\n12      Article 22(1) and (2) of Law 60/2003 provided as follows:\n\n‘1.      Arbitrators shall have jurisdiction to rule on matters falling within their own competence, including pleas relating to the existence or validity of arbitration agreements or any plea which, if upheld, would preclude an examination of the substance of the dispute. For that purpose, an arbitration agreement in a contract shall be regarded as a separate agreement, distinct from the other terms and conditions of the contract. Where it is decided by the arbitrators that the contract is void, the arbitration agreement shall not automatically be void.\n\n2.      The pleas referred to in paragraph 1 must be raised no later than in the statement of defence and the fact that a party has appointed or participated in the appointment of the arbitrators shall not preclude it from raising such pleas. A plea alleging that the arbitrators do not have competence to adjudicate on the question at issue must be raised as soon as the question which is alleged to be beyond their competence is raised in the arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe arbitrators shall admit pleas raised subsequently only if the delay in raising them is justified.’\n\n13      Article 40 of Law 60/2003 was worded as follows:\n\n‘A final award can be challenged in an action for annulment in accordance with the provisions laid down in this title.’\n\n14      Article 41(1) of Law 60/2003 stated as follows:\n\n‘An award may be annulled only where the party seeking annulment claims and proves that:\n\n…\n\n(f) the award is contrary to public policy.\n\n…’\n\n15      Under Article 41(4) of Law 60/2003, an action for annulment had to be brought within two months of the date of notification of the arbitration award.\n\n16      Article 43 of Law 60/2003 provided as follows:\n\n‘A final award shall have the effect of res judicata and any appeal against that award shall lie only on a point of law, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to final decisions.’\n\n17      Article 44 of Law 60/2003 provided as follows:\n\n‘Enforcement of awards shall be governed by the provision laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure and in this title.’\n\n18      Article 517(2)(2) of Ley 1/2000 de Enjuiciamiento Civil (Code of Civil Procedure) of 7 January 2000 (BOE No 7 of 8 January 2000) (‘Law 1/2000’) provides that arbitration awards or decisions are enforceable.\n\n19      Article 559(1) of Law 1/2000 is worded as follows:\n\n‘The party against whom enforcement is sought shall also have the right to resist enforcement on the ground of the following procedural irregularities:\n\n1.      The party against whom enforcement is sought does not have the legal character or representation referred to in the application;\n\n2.      the party seeking enforcement lacks the capacity or representation or it is not established that he has the capacity or representation referred to in the application;\n\n3.      the enforcement order is null and void because it does not set out the arbitration award or decision requiring performance of the contract, the document submitted does not satisfy the statutory requirements necessary for it to be enforceable or because the provisions in Article 520 of this law are infringed when execution is being carried out;\n\n4.      where the measure to be enforced is an arbitration award which has not been duly processed by a notary, the fact that it has not been authenticated.’\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n20      On 24 May 2004, a subscription contract for a mobile telephone was concluded between Asturcom and Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira. The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any dispute concerning the performance of the contract was to be referred for arbitration to the Asociación Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and Equity) (‘AEADE’). The seat of that arbitration tribunal, which was not indicated in the contact, is located in Bilbao.\n\n21      Since Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira failed to pay a number of bills and terminated the contract before the agreed minimum subscription period had expired, Asturcom initiated arbitration proceedings against her before the AEADE.\n\n22      The arbitration award, made on 14 April 2005, ordered Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira to pay the sum of EUR 669.60.\n\n23      Since Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira did not initiate proceedings for annulment of the arbitration award, it became final.\n\n24      On 29 October 2007, Asturcom brought an action before the Juzgado de Primera Instancia (Court of First Instance) No 4 de Bilbao (Spain) for enforcement of the arbitration award.\n\n25      In its order for reference, that court states that the arbitration clause in the subscription contract is unfair, particularly in view of the fact that, first, the costs incurred by the consumer in travelling to the seat of the arbitration tribunal were greater than the amount at issue in the dispute in the main proceedings. Next, according to that court, that seat is located at a considerable distance from the consumer’s place of residence and its location is not indicated in the contract. Lastly, that body itself draws up the contracts which are subsequently used by telecommunications undertakings.\n\n26      However, the referring court also points out, first, that arbitrators are not permitted under Law 60/2003 to examine of their own motion whether unfair arbitration clauses are void and, second, Law 1/2000 does not contain any provision dealing with the assessment to be carried by the court or tribunal having jurisdiction as to whether arbitration clauses are unfair when adjudicating on an action for enforcement of an arbitration award that has become final.\n\n27      In those circumstances, since it entertained doubts as to whether the national legislation, in particular its domestic procedural rules, is compatible with Community law, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao decided to stay the proceedings and to refer to the Court the following question for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘In order that the protection given to consumers by [Directive 93/13] should be guaranteed, is it necessary for the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair arbitration clause that is to the detriment of the consumer?’\n\n **The question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n28      By its question, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao asks, in essence, whether the Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has acquired the force of res judicata and was made in the absence of the consumer is required to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a consumer and a seller or supplier is unfair and to annul the award.\n\n29      For the purpose of replying to the question referred, it is appropriate to note, first, that the system of protection introduced by Directive 93/13 is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of those terms (Joined Cases C‑240/98 to C‑244/98 _Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_ [2000] ECR I‑4941, paragraph 25, and Case C‑168/05 _Mostaza Claro_ [2006] ECR I‑10421, paragraph 25).\n\n30      As regards that weaker position, Article 6(1) of that directive provides that unfair terms are not binding on the consumer. As is apparent from case-law, that is a mandatory provision which aims to replace the formal balance which the contract establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph 36, and Case C‑243/08 _Pannon GSM_ [2009] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 25).\n\n31      In order to guarantee the protection intended by Directive 93/13, the Court has also stated on a number of occasions that the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier may be corrected only by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract (_Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 27, and _Mostaza Claro_, paragraph 26).\n\n32      It is in the light of those principles that the Court has therefore held that the national court is required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph 38).\n\n33      However, the present case can be distinguished from that which gave rise to the judgment in _Mostaza Claro_ in that Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira did not in any way become involved in the various proceedings relating to the dispute between her and Asturcom and, in particular, did not bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award made by the AEADE in order to challenge the arbitration clause on the ground that it was unfair, so that that award now has the force of res judicata.\n\n34      Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether the need to replace the formal balance which the contract establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them requires the court or tribunal responsible for enforcement to ensure that the consumer is afforded absolute protection, even where the consumer has not brought any legal proceedings in order to assert his rights and notwithstanding the fact that the domestic rules of procedure apply the principle of res judicata.\n\n35      It is necessary at the outset to draw attention to the importance, both for the Community legal order and for the national legal systems, of the principle of res judicata.\n\n36      Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to observe that, in order to ensure stability of the law and legal relations, as well as the sound administration of justice, it is important that judicial decisions which have become definitive after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after expiry of the time-limits provided to exercise those rights can no longer be called into question (Case C‑224/01 _Köbler_ [2003] ECR I‑10239, paragraph 38; Case C‑234/04 _Kapferer_ [2006] ECR I‑2585, paragraph 20; and Case C‑2/08 _Fallimento Olimpiclub_ [2009] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 22).\n\n37      Consequently, according to the case-law of the Court, Community law does not require a national court to disapply domestic rules of procedure conferring finality on a decision, even if to do so would make it possible to remedy an infringement of a provision of Community law, regardless of its nature, on the part of the decision at issue (see, inter alia, Case C‑126/97 _Eco Swiss_ [1999] ECR I‑3055, paragraphs 47 and 48; _Kapferer_, paragraph 21; and _Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph 23).\n\n38      In the absence of Community legislation in this area, the rules implementing the principle of res judicata are a matter for the national legal order, in accordance with the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States. However, those rules must not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence); nor may they be framed in such a way as to make it in practice impossible or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness) (see, inter alia, _Kapferer_, paragraph 22, and _Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph 24).\n\n39      As regards, first, the principle of effectiveness, the Court has already held that every case in which the question arises as to whether a national procedural provision makes the application of Community law impossible or excessively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, its progress and its special features, viewed as a whole, before the various national bodies. For those purposes, account must be taken, where appropriate, of the basic principles of the domestic judicial system, such as protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of procedure (Case C-312/93 _Peterbroeck_ [1995] ECR I-4599, paragraph 14, and _Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph 27).\n\n40      In the present case, the arbitration award at issue in the main proceedings became final because the consumer in question did not bring an action for annulment of the award within the time-limit prescribed for that purpose.\n\n41      According to established case-law, it is compatible with Community law to lay down reasonable time-limits for bringing proceedings in the interests of legal certainty (see, to this effect, Case 33/76 _Rewe-Zentralfinanz and Rewe-Zentral_ [1976] ECR 1989, paragraph 5; Case C‑261/95 _Palmisani_ [1997] ECR I‑4025, paragraph 28; and Case C‑2/06 _Kempter_ [2008] ECR I‑411, paragraph 58). Such time-limits are not liable to make it virtually impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights conferred by Community law (see, to that effect, Case C‑255/00 _Grundig Italiana_ [2002] ECR I‑8003, paragraph 34).\n\n42      It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether it is reasonable to impose a two-month time-limit, such as that laid down in Article 41(4) of Law 60/2003, upon the expiry of which, in the absence of any action for annulment, an arbitration award becomes final and thus acquires the authority of res judicata.\n\n43      In the present case, it should be noted first that, as the Court has already held, a period of 60 days is not objectionable per se (see, to that effect, _Peterbroeck_, paragraph 16).\n\n44      A peremptory time-limit of that kind is reasonable in that it enables both an assessment to be made as to whether there are grounds for challenging an arbitration award and, if appropriate, the action for annulment of the award to be prepared. It should be pointed out that in the present case it has not been alleged that the national procedural rules governing the bringing of an action for annulment of an arbitration award, in particular the ruling imposing a two-month time-limit for that purpose, were unreasonable.\n\n45      Moreover, it should be pointed out that Article 41(4) of Law 60/2003 provides that the time-limit starts to run from the date of notification of the arbitration award. Therefore, in the action in the main proceedings, it was not possible for the consumer to have found herself in a situation in which the limitation period had started to run, or had expired, without even being aware of the effects of the unfair arbitration clause upon her.\n\n46      In such circumstances, such a time-limit is consistent with the principle of effectiveness, since it is not in itself likely to make it virtually impossible or excessively difficult to exercise any rights which the consumer derives from Directive 93/13 (see, to that effect, Case C‑327/00 _Santex_ [2003] ECR I‑1877, paragraph 55).\n\n47      In any event, the need to comply with the principle of effectiveness cannot be stretched so far as to mean that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, a national court is required not only to compensate for a procedural omission on the part of a consumer who is unaware of his rights, as in the case which gave rise to the judgment in _Mostaza Claro_, but also to make up fully for the total inertia on the part of the consumer concerned who, like the defendant in the main proceedings, neither participated in the arbitration proceedings nor brought an action for annulment of the arbitration award, which therefore became final.\n\n48      In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be held that the procedural rules laid down by the Spanish system for the protection of consumers against unfair terms in contracts does not make it impossible or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred on consumers by Directive 93/13.\n\n49      Next, in accordance with the principle of equivalence, the conditions imposed by domestic law under which the courts and tribunals may apply a rule of Community law of their own motion must not be less favourable than those governing the application by those bodies of their own motion of rules of domestic law of the same ranking (see, to that effect, inter alia, Joined Cases C‑430/93 and C‑431/93 _van Schijndel and van Veen_ [1995] ECR I‑4705, paragraphs 13 and 17 and the case-law cited).\n\n50      In order to determine whether that principle is complied with in the case before the national court, it is for that court, which alone has direct knowledge of the detailed procedural rules governing actions in the field of domestic law, to consider both the purpose and the essential characteristics of domestic actions which are claimed to be similar (see, inter alia, Case C‑78/98 _Preston and Others_ [2000] ECR I‑3201, paragraphs 49 and 56). However, with a view to the appraisal to be carried out by the national court, the Court may provide guidance for the interpretation of Community law (see _Preston and Others_, paragraph 50).\n\n51      As pointed out at paragraph 30 above, Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13 is a mandatory provision. It should also be noted that, according to the Court’s case-law, that directive as a whole constitutes, in accordance with Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the European Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life throughout the Community (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph 37).\n\n52      Accordingly, in view of the nature and importance of the public interest underlying the protection which Directive 93/13 confers on consumers,  \nArticle 6 of the directive must be regarded as a provision of equal standing to national rules which rank, within the domestic legal system, as rules of public policy.\n\n53      It follows from this that, inasmuch as the national court or tribunal seised of an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award is required, in accordance with domestic rules of procedure, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is in conflict with domestic rules of public policy, it is also obliged to assess of its own motion whether that clause is unfair in the light of Article 6 of that directive, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task (see, to that effect, _Pannon GSM_, paragraph 32).\n\n54      The national court or tribunal is also under such an obligation where, under the domestic legal system, it has a discretion whether to consider of its own motion whether such a clause is in conflict with national rules of public policy (see, to that effect, _van Schijndel and van Veen_, paragraphs 13, 14 and 22, and _Kempter_, paragraph 45).\n\n55      As regards the case in the main proceedings, according to the Spanish Government, the court or tribunal responsible for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final has jurisdiction to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a consumer and a seller or supplier is null and void on the ground that such a clause is contrary to national rules of public policy. Moreover, a number of recent judgments of the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Provincial Court, Madrid) (Spain) and the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) (Spain) have acknowledged that jurisdiction.\n\n56      It is therefore for the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao to ascertain whether that is the case in the dispute before it.\n\n57      Lastly, as regards the consequences of a finding by the court responsible for enforcement that the arbitration clause in a contract concluded by a seller or supplier with a consumer is unfair, it should be recalled that Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13 requires the Member States to lay down that unfair terms are not to be binding on the consumer, ‘as provided for under their national law’.\n\n58      Accordingly, as the Hungarian Government suggested in its written observations, it is for the referring court to give due effect, in accordance with national law, to any finding in relation to the arbitration award that an arbitration clause is unfair, so long as the clause is not capable of binding the consumer.\n\n59      In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature. If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause.\n\n **Costs**\n\n60      Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n**Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature. If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62008CJ0040#Footref*) Language of the case: Spanish.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.915788521Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Asturcom-AG":{"title":"","content":"## Opinion of the Advocate-General\n\nI – Introduction\n\n1. In the present reference for a preliminary ruling, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao (Court of First Instance No 4, Bilbao) (‘the referring court’) has asked the Court of Justice a question on the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. (2)\n\n2. Specifically, the question is whether, in order for the purpose of the directive, which is to protect consumers, to be attained, the national court hearing an action for enforcement must determine of its own motion whether an arbitration agreement is void and accordingly annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.\n\nII – Legislative framework\n\nA – Community law\n\n3. Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13 provides as follows:\n\n‘A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.’\n\n4. Article 6(1) of that directive states as follows:\n\n‘Member States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for under their national law, not be binding on the consumer and that the contract shall continue to bind the parties upon those terms if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair terms.’\n\n5. Article 7(1) of the directive provides as follows:\n\n‘Member States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers.’\n\n6. The annex to the directive contains an indicative list of the terms which may be regarded as unfair. Point 1(q) of the annex mentions terms which have the object or effect of ‘excluding or hindering the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy, particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not covered by legal provisions, unduly restricting the evidence available to him or imposing on him a burden of proof which, according to the applicable law, should lie with another party to the contract’.\n\nB – National law\n\n7. Under Spanish law, consumers were initially protected against unfair terms by Ley General 26/1984 para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios (General Law 26/1984 for the protection of consumers and users) of 19 July 1984, Boletín Oficial del Estado (Official State Gazette) (BOE) No 176 of 24 July 1984 (‘Law 26/1984’).\n\n8. Law 26/1984 was amended by Ley 7/1998 sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contratación (Law 7/1998 on general contractual conditions) of 13 April 1998 (BOE No 89 of 14 April 1998) (‘Law 7/1998’), which transposed the directive into national law.\n\n9. In particular, Law 7/1998 added to Law 26/1984 an Article 10a, paragraph 1 of which provides as follows:\n\n‘All those terms not individually negotiated which, contrary to the requirement of good faith, cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer, shall be regarded as unfair terms. In any event, the terms listed in the first additional provision to this Law shall be regarded as unfair.\n\n…’\n\n10. Article 8 of Law 7/1998 provides as follows:\n\n‘1. General conditions which infringe the provisions of this Law or any other rule ordering or prohibiting certain conduct, to the detriment of a party to the contract, shall automatically be void, save in so far as they make separate provision for cases of breach.\n\n2. In particular, general terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article 10a and the first additional provision of Law 26/1984 … shall be void.’\n\n11. At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, arbitration proceedings were governed by Ley 60/2003 de Arbitraje (Law 60/2003 on arbitration) of 23 December 2003 (BOE No 309 of 26 December 2003) (‘Law 60/2003’).\n\n12. Article 8(4) and (5) of Law 60/2003 is worded as follows:\n\n‘4. The court of first instance of the place in which the award was made shall have jurisdiction to hear an action for enforcement of the award in accordance with Article 545(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure …\n\n5. An action for annulment of an arbitration award shall be brought before the Audiencia Provincial [Provincial Court] of the place in which that award was made.’\n\n13. Article 22 of Law 60/2003 provides as follows:\n\n‘1. Arbitrators shall have jurisdiction to rule in matters falling within their own competence, including pleas relating to the existence or validity of arbitration agreements or any plea which, if upheld, would preclude an examination of the substance of the dispute. For that purpose, an arbitration agreement in a contract shall be regarded as a separate agreement, distinct from the other terms and conditions of the contract. Where it is decided by the arbitrators that the contract is void, the arbitration agreement shall not automatically be void.\n\n2. The pleas referred to in paragraph 1 must be raised no later than in the statement of defence, and the fact that a party has appointed or participated in the appointment of the arbitrators shall not preclude it from raising such pleas. A plea alleging that the arbitrators do not have competence to adjudicate on the question at issue must be raised as soon as the question which is alleged to be beyond their competence is raised in the arbitration proceedings.’\n\n14. Article 40 of Law 60/2003 states as follows:\n\n‘A final award can be challenged in an action for annulment in accordance with the provisions laid down in this title’.\n\n15. Article 41(1) of Law 60/2003 contains the following provisions:\n\n‘An award may be annulled only where the party seeking annulment claims and proves that:\n\n(a) the arbitration agreement does not exist or is invalid;\n\n(b) he was not duly notified of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or that, for any other reason, he has been unable to exercise his rights;\n\n…\n\n(f) the award is contrary to public policy.’\n\n16. Article 43 of Law 60/2003 states as follows:\n\n‘A final award shall have the effect of res judicata and any appeal against that award shall lie only on a point of law, in accordance with the provisions of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil (Code of Civil Procedure) applicable to final decisions.’\n\n17. Under Article 44 of Law 60/2003, the enforcement of awards is governed by the provisions laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure and Title VIII of that law.\n\n18. Article 517(2)(2) of Law 1/2000 of 7 January 2000 on Civil Procedure (BOE No 7 of 8 January 2000) (‘Law 1/2000’) provides that arbitration awards or decisions are enforceable.\n\n19. Article 556(1) of Law 1/2000 lays down the right of the party against whom enforcement is sought to challenge enforcement within ten days following the date of notification of the enforcement order.\n\n20. Article 559(1) of Law 1/2000 sets out a number of procedural irregularities on the basis of which the party against whom enforcement is sought may challenge enforcement.\n\nIII – Facts, main proceedings and the question referred\n\n21. María Cristina Rodríguez Nogueira (‘the party against whom enforcement is sought’) concluded with the operator Asturcom Telecomunicaciones SL (‘Asturcom’) a contract for mobile telephones for individuals on 24 May 2004. That contract contained an arbitration clause under which any dispute relating to the performance of the contract was to be referred to arbitration to the Asociación Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity) (‘AEADE’).\n\n22. In the contract, the party against whom enforcement is sought undertook, inter alia, to maintain her subscription for a period of 18 months from the effective date of commencement of the service and to spend a minimum of EUR 6 per line. She also undertook not to vary the terms agreed with the operator. She agreed to pay the bills and not to cancel any other lines rented from the same operator. It was also stipulated that if the customer was in breach of the contract, she would pay the operator the sum of EUR 300 per line rented. Where necessary, that sum would be claimed in relevant proceedings.\n\n23. Since the party against whom enforcement is sought failed to pay a number of telephone bills and terminated the contract before the end of the minimum subscription period, on 16 February 200[5] Asturcom initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE in Bilbao, claiming that she was in breach of the contract.\n\n24. By award of 14 April 2005, the party against whom enforcement is sought was ordered to pay a sum of EUR 669.60. Since she did not bring an action to have the award declared void, the award became final.\n\n25. On 29 October 2007 Asturcom lodged an application for enforcement of the award against Cristina Rodríguez Nogueira, for the purpose of recovering the abovementioned sum, together with EUR 300 interest and costs.\n\n26. In its order for reference, the referring court first sets out the grounds on which it considers the arbitration agreement in the contract to be unfair. It refers, inter alia, to the fact that the association entrusted with arbitration itself draws up the mobile telephone contracts, that the arbitration agreement does not specify in which city the seat of arbitration is located or provide for a choice between a number of cities, and that the cost of travelling to the seat of arbitration is greater than the debt at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n27. Nevertheless, the referring court explains that the Spanish legislation governing arbitration neither requires nor permits arbitration tribunals to examine arbitration agreements of their own motion and to annul clauses which are void or unfair.\n\n28. The referring court has doubts as to the compatibility of those procedural rules with Community law. It has therefore stayed the proceedings in order to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘In order that the protection given to consumers by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts should be guaranteed, is it necessary for the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair arbitration clause that is to the detriment of the consumer?’\n\nIV – Procedure before the Court\n\n29. The order for reference of 29 January 2008 was lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 5 February 2008.\n\n30. Written observations were submitted by Asturcom, the Governments of the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Hungary and by the Commission within the period laid down in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice.\n\n31. As none of the parties applied for the oral procedure to be opened, it was possible to prepare the Opinion in this case after the general meeting of the Court on 10 February 2009.\n\nV – Main arguments of the parties\n\n32. Asturcom proposes that the question asked by the referring court be answered in the negative. It points out that, even though the Spanish legal order does not expressly grant the national court any such power, the national court is nevertheless entitled, in accordance with the judgment in Mostaza Claro , (3) to review of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is void in an action for annulment. The national legislation is therefore consistent with the requirements laid down by Community law with regard to the protection of consumers against unfair terms.\n\n33. Asturcom also points out that the case-law of the Spanish Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) treats arbitration awards and judicial decisions in the same way, with the result that if – as in the main proceedings – an arbitration award is not challenged within two months of its notification, it acquires the force of res judicata , in the same way\\ as an unchallengeable and enforceable court judgment. Consequently, a court hearing an action for enforcement in respect of an unchallengeable arbitration award may not assess, ab initio and of its own motion, whether an arbitration agreement is valid or void, and thus refuse an enforcement order, as the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid has made clear in its rulings.\n\n34. Such an interpretation not only makes it possible to observe the principle of legal certainty, since the award has the force of res judicata , but is also compatible with the abovementioned judgment in Mostaza Claro , which recognises the national court’s power to determine whether an unfair arbitration clause is void only in an action for annulment of an arbitration ruling which is not yet final.\n\n35. The Hungarian and the Spanish Governments , on the other hand, suggest that the Court recognise that the national court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award has jurisdiction to determine whether an arbitration agreement is void. They essentially put forward the same arguments, in particular with regard to the possibility of the mutatis mutandis application of the principles developed in case-law.\n\n36. The Hungarian Government argues, in particular, that it is clear from the Court’s case-law that the reasons of public interest underlying the protective purpose of the directive, specifically require the national court to determine whether a term in a consumer contract is unfair, especially in a case such as that in the main proceedings.\n\n37. The Spanish Government essentially reaches the same conclusion, while at the same time providing some clarification as to national procedural law.\n\n38. For example, it points out that there is no incompatibility between the national legal order of the Member States and the Community legal order with regard to protection of consumers against unfair terms. Under the relevant Spanish rules, the validity of an arbitration clause can and must be examined as a matter of public policy, not only by the court hearing the main action, but also by the court responsible for enforcement, irrespective of whether the party concerned has appeared before the arbitration tribunal or the court responsible for enforcement and irrespective of whether that party has initiated proceedings.\n\n39. According to the Spanish Government, several judicial decisions in Spain, including a judgment of the Audiencia Nacional of 9 May 2005, have recognised that the national court has jurisdiction to review an arbitration award which it is called upon to enforce, in particular for reasons of public policy, even where neither of the parties has made such a request.\n\n40. Therefore, upon a proper implementation of the principle of consumer protection and a broad interpretation of the notion of public policy, the national court responsible for enforcement must be able to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration agreement is valid and to annul the arbitration award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term.\n\n41. The Commission first of all highlights certain differences between the facts in the present case and the situation in Mostaza Claro . First, the consumer in the present case took no step to become involved in the proceedings and, secondly, the question of whether the arbitration clause is unfair has been raised not in an action for annulment of the award, but in enforcement proceedings. The Commission also acknowledges that the powers of review enjoyed by the court responsible for enforcement are more limited, in principle, than those of a court hearing an action for annulment.\n\n42. Nevertheless, the Commission argues that the importance of the aims pursued by the directive makes it necessary, exceptionally, for the court responsible for enforcement to have the power to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair and, if appropriate, to annul it. In cases such as that in the main proceedings, in which the consumer has not taken legal action to challenge the arbitration award, the court responsible for enforcement is the only impartial body, since it has no personal interest at all in maintaining the arbitration clause, an attribute which qualifies it to review the validity of that clause.\n\n43. Lastly, the Commission gives its view on the question raised by the referring court as to whether the national court has not only a power but also a duty to examine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair. Relying on paragraph 38 and the operative part of the judgment in Mostaza Claro , it concludes that the national court has such a duty.\n\nVI – Legal assessment\n\nA – Introductory remarks\n\n44. According to the definition contained in Article 3 of Directive 93/13, an unfair term is a term which the economically stronger party draws up unilaterally in advance and imposes on the other party, who is not able to influence the substance of the term. What essentially distinguishes an unfair term according to Article 3(1) is that, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer. (4)\n\n45. The problem of unfair terms in consumer contracts was familiar long before Directive 93/13 entered into force. In a growing service-oriented consumer society such as Europe, the use of standard contracts, whose individual terms are no longer individually negotiated by the parties, had inevitably become increasingly widespread. The danger of using such contractual terms which have been unilaterally drawn up in advance lies in the failure to take into account or the insufficient attention paid to the interests of the the other party to the contract. (5)\n\n46. Directive 93/13 is intended to redress this situation through a partial harmonisation of Member States’ national consumer protection measures. (6) Its aim is to guarantee uniform minimum protection against unfair terms in consumer contracts in the Member States of the Community. The key provisions of the directive are, first, Article 6(1), under which Member States must lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier are not to be ‘binding on the consumer’. Secondly, Article 7(1) provides that Member States must ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist ‘to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers’.\n\n47. From the point of view of legal doctrine, Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 93/13 are binding provisions of secondary law on consumer protection, the consequence of which is that contractual freedom, the principle expression of autonomy in private law, is restricted. (7)\n\nB – The power of national courts and tribunals to review unfair terms according to the Court’s case-law\n\n48. In the judgments in Océano , (8) Cofidis , (9) and Mostaza Claro , (10) the Court interpreted those provisions and gave them a significance which enables the national court, in the exercise of its functions, to take effective action against unfair terms. The present case must be considered against the background of those judgments. It must therefore be examined below to what extent the principles developed in those judgments may be applied to the present case in the light of the common features of the different cases.\n\n49. Regard must be had first of all to the principles developed in case-law on the basis of which the present case must then be examined.\n\n50. The starting point for the Court’s considerations in interpreting Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 93/13 was the fact that the system of protection introduced by the directive is based on the idea that ‘the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of the terms’. (11) The Court concluded from this that ‘the imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier may only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract’. (12)\n\n51. The Court also found that the national court’s power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair must be regarded as constituting a proper means of achieving the result sought by Article 6 of the directive, namely preventing an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term. It also regarded this power held by the national court as a proper means of contributing to achieving the aim of Article 7, since if the court undertakes such an examination, that may act as a deterrent and contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers. (13) The Court also held that the power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair must be regarded as necessary for the purpose of achieving effective consumer protection, especially since there is a real risk that the consumer, particularly because of a lack of awareness, will not challenge the term pleaded against him on the ground that it is unfair.\n\n52. On the basis of the above considerations, the Court ruled in Océano (14) that the protection provided for consumers by Directive 93/13 entails the national court being able to determine of its own motion whether a term of a contract before it is unfair when making its preliminary assessment as to whether a claim should be allowed to proceed before the national courts.\n\n53. In Cofidis , (15) the Court further clarified its case-law to the effect that the power of a national court to find, of its own motion or following a plea raised by the consumer, that a term of the contract is void cannot be made subject to provisions requiring observance of a limitation period.\n\n54. Lastly, in Mostaza Claro , (16) the Court ruled that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award may determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n55. The Court based its decision on the ground that the result sought by Article 6 of the directive could not be achieved if the court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award was unable to determine whether that award was void solely because the consumer did not plead the invalidity of the arbitration agreement in the course of the arbitration proceedings. (17) Such an omission by the consumer could not then, under any circumstances, be compensated for by action on the part of persons not party to the contract. In the view of the Court, the regime of special protection established by the directive would be definitively undermined. (18)\n\nC – Analysis of the question referred\n\n1. The power of review of the court responsible for enforcement\n\n56. Like the Mostaza Claro case, the present case concerns an arbitration clause which the referring court considers to be unfair. (19) According to the Court’s case-law, it is for the national court to determine whether a contractual term satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13. (20) In the view of the referring court, the arbitration clause at issue impedes Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira from exercising her rights of defence and from taking legal action or exercising any other legal remedy, which suggests that it falls within Article 3(3) of the directive, in conjunction with paragraph 1(q) of the Annex.\n\n57. However, the present case differs from Mostaza Claro in that Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira did not appear before the arbitration tribunal or bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award. Unlike in the Mostaza Claro case, the question therefore arises whether the national court may determine whether a term is unfair in the course of enforcement proceedings. A further difference lies in the fact that in Mostaza Claro the consumers relied expressly on the unfair nature of the arbitration clause at issue, whereas in the present case the referring court is asking whether the question whether such a clause is unfair must also be examined of its own motion by the court hearing an action for enforcement.\n\n58. With the exception of Asturcom, all the parties take the view that the national court must also have the power in enforcement proceedings to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul that clause. That view is correct.\n\n59. In my opinion, that interpretation takes best account of the aim of Directive 93/13, which is to protect consumers. It is also consistent with the wording of Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13, which expressly calls on the Member States to employ ‘adequate and effective means’ to protect consumers against the use of unfair terms. The need for national implementing measures to be effective – a point emphasised by the Community legislature – is of particular importance for the purpose of legal assessment of the question referred for a preliminary ruling. Lastly, that interpretation is in keeping with the consistent case-law of the Court, which requires the Member States, in implementing directives, effectively to guarantee the rights of individuals, if the directive grants such rights. (21)\n\n60. This is certainly not inconsistent with the institutional and procedural autonomy enjoyed by the Member States. The Court has consistently held that, in the absence of Community rules governing the matter, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction and to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Community law. (22)\n\n61. This is to be seen in the light of the fact that, according to settled case-law, the principle of effective judicial protection is a general principle of Community law stemming from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, which has been enshrined in Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and has also been reaffirmed by Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, (23) proclaimed on 7 December 2000 in Nice. (24) In addition, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the right to be heard must be guaranteed ‘in all proceedings initiated against a person which are liable to culminate in a measure adversely affecting that person’, (25) and thus also in arbitration proceedings. (26)\n\n62. In the legal systems of the Member States, the purpose of enforcement proceedings is not, generally, to carry out a substantive examination of an arbitration award, but simply to enforce it. The possibility for the party against whom enforcement is sought to rely on substantive pleas against an enforcement order is, as a rule, also limited under the Member States’ laws on enforcement and is available only if specific conditions are satisfied. (27) Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is necessary to accord the national court a power of review along these lines also in enforcement proceedings, if the aim of Directive 93/13, which is to protect consumers, is not to be frustrated. (28)\n\n63. An interpretation to the contrary would mean that the unfair nature of a contractual term would prevail definitively and irrevocably, to the detriment of the consumer. This would create a legal situation which the Community legislature sought to avoid at all costs, given the special importance attached to the protection of the economic interests of consumers.\n\n64. The circumstances of the present case provide a particularly striking demonstration of the fact that it would be incompatible with Directive 93/13 for the court responsible for enforcement to be deprived of such a power of review. In such a case, in order to be spared the negative consequences of a void contractual term, the consumer would really have to challenge the term in question before the enforcement proceedings, that is to say in the preceding proceedings. In the present case, Mrs Rodríguez Nogueira, as the party against whom enforcement is sought, would have had to take part in the arbitration proceedings, the very lawfulness of which is questioned by the referring court. In other words, national law would expect the consumer to take part in invalid proceedings in order to be able to have the contract annulled. Such an outcome would be unacceptable and shows that the court responsible for enforcement must have an appropriate power of review.\n\n65. Furthermore, as the Court has held, in order for the objective of the directive to be attained, the imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier must be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract. (29) According to the referring court, the Spanish legislation governing arbitration neither requires nor permits arbitration tribunals to examine arbitration clauses of their own motion and annul those which are void or unfair. (30)\n\n66. However, even if arbitrators were required or permitted to do so, serious doubts would remain as to whether an arbitrator can always be regarded as independent and neutral, especially since an arbitrator may possibly have a personal interest in maintaining the arbitration clause on which he is required to adjudicate. The Commission correctly draws attention to that point. (31) This is true, for example, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, where the arbitration agreement has been drafted by the same association which is entrusted with the arbitration proceedings. Consequently, the assessment of whether an unfair arbitration clause is void may not be given over to the arbitrator alone. Rather, this task must be the responsibility of a court, which fully guarantees the judicial impartiality required in a State governed by the rule of law.\n\n67. If, however, the person concerned does not bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award, which is a plausible assumption, particularly in view of the frequent lack of business experience among consumers, (32) and if that award thus becomes final, the court hearing an action for enforcement will generally be the one and only judicial body with the power to assess whether a contractual term is lawful. (33) It is therefore logical for the Community legal order to recognise that the court responsible for enforcement should have that power, specifically in view of its unique position. It is for the Member States to ensure that the court responsible for enforcement has the necessary procedural powers to reject an application for enforcement and to annul the arbitration award.\n\n68. One of the grounds on which an action for enforcement may be rejected may in principle be the need to protect a Member State’s public policy. Provision is made in this regard in international law in Article 5(2)(a) of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (34) and in Article 29(2) of the 1966 Council of Europe Convention providing a Uniform Law on Arbitration. (35) The legal systems of some European Union Member States have a similar provision. (36)\n\n69. Spanish substantive law does not expressly confer jurisdiction on the court responsible for enforcement to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is lawful. The referring court draws attention to that fact in its order for reference. The powers of review of a Spanish court responsible for enforcement are therefore limited, as is the case in most Community Member States, and tend to be orientated towards observance of the formalities of the enforcement proceedings. Nevertheless, it must be stated that in the last few years various Spanish courts entrusted with the enforcement of arbitration awards have rejected applications for enforcement on the ground that the awards in question were incompatible with public policy. (37) A substantial proportion of the case-law (38) and academic legal writing(39) in Spain appears to concur with this view. A more recent line of cases essentially reaches the same conclusion, the need for consumer protection being cited as the jurisdiction for the court responsible for enforcement having such powers. (40) Nevertheless, the legal situation in Spain does not yet appear to have been fully clarified, in the absence of clear rulings from the higher courts.\n\n70. It would seem to me appropriate for the Community legal order to embrace a principle which is recognised not only in international law, but also in the legal orders of some European Union Member States, according to which the enforcement of an arbitration award which is contrary to public policy is prohibited, in the light of the fact that in Mostaza Claro the Court implicitly ranked Community-law consumer protection provisions as rules capable of being governed by considerations of public policy. (41) The Court concluded that the annulment of an arbitration award which infringed such a rule is justified.\n\n71. As the Court made clear in that judgment, the mandatory provision laid down in Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13, under which unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier must ‘not be binding on the consumer’, requires the national court to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier. (42) In addition, in the view of the Court, as the aim of Directive 93/13 is to strengthen consumer protection, it constitutes, in accordance with Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life in its territory. (43)\n\n72. I am well aware that this interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 93/13 could ultimately amount to disregarding the principle of res judicata under the legal orders of some Member States, which necessarily raises the question as to how such an interpretation can be reconciled with the previous case-law of the Court of Justice on the authority to be accorded to legal acts and final national judgments which are contrary to Community law.\n\n73. In its judgment in Kapferer , (44) the Court drew attention to the importance, both for the Community legal order and national legal systems, of the principle of res judicata and in so doing confirmed the principle that, in order to ensure both stability of the law and legal relations and the sound administration of justice, it is important that judicial decisions which have become definitive after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after expiry of the time-limits provided for in that connection can no longer be called into question. The Court also ruled, by reference to the judgment in Eco Swiss , (45) that the principle of cooperation under Article 10 EC does not require a national court to disapply domestic rules of procedure in order to review a judicial decision that has become final and to set it aside if that decision is contrary to Community law. (46)\n\n74. Nevertheless, the Court resolved this tension between legal certainty and consumer protection by implicitly stating that the principle of res judicata was subject to the observance of the principles of equivalence and of effectiveness. By laying down the procedural rules for proceedings designed to ensure protection of the rights which individuals acquire through the direct effect of Community law, Member States must ensure that such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and are not framed in such a way as to render impossible in practice the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness). (47)\n\n75. In the light of the above considerations, and above all in view of the need for effective consumer protection (48) and having regard to the case-law of the Court of Justice (49) which expressly requires positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract, I am convinced that it may be necessary, in exceptional cases, to disregard the principle of res judicata.\n\n76. It follows that the national court must reject an application for enforcement of a final arbitration award made in the absence of the consumer and annul that award, if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer. (50)\n\n2. Duty of examination of the court responsible for enforcement\n\n77. Although the question referred is not entirely clear in this respect, the referring court also appears to be asking the Court to answer the question whether the court responsible for enforcement is not only entitled but also obliged to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair.\n\n78. In this regard it must be stated, first of all, that in both Océano (51) and Cofidis (52) the Court referred to the ‘power’ of the national court to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair. Prima facie, this might suggest that the national court may determine whether a term is unfair, but is not required to do so. However, such an interpretation of those judgments would fail to take account of the fact that the Court’s arguments centred on the aim of Directive 93/13, which is to protect consumers.\n\n79. The Court attached particular importance to the fact that such a judicial examination could act as a deterrent and thus contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers. In my opinion, however, the desired deterrent effect of such an examination would be substantially diminished if it were left to the discretion of the court responsible for enforcement. On the other hand, the protection of consumers would be ensured, in accordance with the requirements of Community law, if the national court were legally required to conduct such an examination. (53)\n\n80. This idea also appears to underlie the judgment in Mostaza Claro . In that judgment, the Court found that the importance of consumer protection within the Community legal order justifies ‘the national court being required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier’. (54)\n\n81. Accordingly, the Court also held in that judgment that Directive 93/13 ‘must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment’. As has already been stated, the Court essentially based its ruling on the ground that Community-law consumer protection rules constitute rules of public policy. (55)\n\n82. It therefore follows from the above considerations that Community imposes a duty of examination on the national court.\n\nVII – Conclusion\n\n83. In the light of the foregoing, I propose that the Court answer the question referred by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao as follows:\n\nIn order that the protection given to consumers by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts should be guaranteed, the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, is required to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.\n\n(1) .\n\n(2)  – OJ 1993 L 95, p. 29.\n\n(3)  – Case C‑168/05 [2006] ECR I‑10421.\n\n(4)  – Kohles, S., Das Recht der vorformulierten Vertragsbedingungen in Spanien – Die Umsetzung der Richtlinie 93/13/EWG über missbräuchliche Klauseln in Verbraucherverträgen , Frankfurt am Main 2004, p. 56.\n\n(5)  – Baier, K., Europäische Verbraucherverträge und missbräuchliche Klauseln – Die Umsetzung der Richtlinie 93/13/EWG über missbräuchliche Klauseln in Verbraucherverträgen in Deutschland, Italien, England und Frankreich , Hamburg 2004, p. 2.\n\n(6)  – Like Directive 85/577/EEC on contracts negotiated away from business premises, Directive 97/7/EC on distance contracts and Directive 1999/44/EC on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, Directive 93/13 is also based on a minimum harmonisation approach. The Commission Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights of 8 October 2008, COM(2008) 614 final, which merges those four directives into a single horizontal instrument, expressly moves away from that approach. The draft directive now embraces a full harmonisation approach, with the result that Member States cannot maintain or adopt provisions diverging from those laid down in the directive. The purpose of the proposal is to contribute to the proper functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market and achieve a high common level of consumer protection by fully harmonising the key aspects of consumer contract law which are relevant for the internal market.\n\n(7)  – With regard to the restriction of contractual freedom as a result of Community acts, see Basedow, J., ‘Die Europäische Union zwischen Marktfreiheit und Überregulierung – Das Schicksal der Vertragsfreiheit’, Sonderdruck aus Bitburger Gespräche Jahrbuch 2008/I , Munich 2009. In the view of the author, secondary Community law is predominantly binding in so far as it relates to private contracts. The vast majority of the rules restrict contractual freedom, and only a few expressly refer to the possibility for the parties to regulate certain matters by way of contract. According to legal commentators, contractual freedom is seen as the principle expression of autonomy in private law and thus as a guarantee of individual rights. For a comparative law perspective on autonomy in private law, see as regards German law, Larenz, K., Wolf, M., Allgemeiner Teil des bürgerlichen Rechts , 9th edition, Munich 2004, paragraph 2, as regards Austrian law Koziol, H., Welser, R., Grundriss des bürgerlichen Rechts.

Díez-Picazo and Gullón state that autonomy in private law is restricted, from a legal point of view, by mandatory rules and rules of public policy.\n\n(8)  – Joined Cases C‑240/98 to C‑244/98 Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores [2000] ECR I‑4941.\n\n(9)  – Case C‑473/00 [2002] ECR I‑10875.\n\n(10)  – Cited in footnote 3.\n\n(11)  – Océano , cited in footnote 8, paragraph 25, and Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraph 25.\n\n(12)  – Océano , cited in footnote 8, paragraph 27, and Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraph 26.\n\n(13)  – Océano , cited in footnote 8, paragraph 28; Cofidis , cited in footnote 9, paragraph 32; and Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraph 27.\n\n(14)  – Cited in footnote 8, paragraph 29.\n\n(15)  – Cited in footnote 9, paragraph 38.\n\n(16)  – Cited in footnote 3, paragraph 39.\n\n(17)  – Ibid., paragraph 30.\n\n(18)  – Ibid., paragraph 31.\n\n(19)  – See page 9 of the order for reference.\n\n(20)  – See Case C‑237/02 Freiburger Kommunalbauten [2004] ECR I‑3403, paragraph 22, and Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraph 23.\n\n(21)  – See Case 103/88 Fratelli Constanzo [1989] ECR 1839, paragraph 29 et seq., and Case C-208/90 Emmott [1991] ECR I‑4269 paragraph 20 et seq.

Some legal systems may provide for exceptions, in the case of performance and deferment, if the party against whom enforcement is sought is able to furnish documentary proof. In principle, the party against whom enforcement is sought has legal remedies available by which he can challenge procedural errors on the part of the body responsible for enforcement. Depending on the legal system, he has available to him forms of action by which he can raise substantive pleas against enforcement (see Schellhammer, K., Zivilprozess , 10th edition, Heidelberg 2003, p. 109 et seq., paragraphs 219 and 223; Lackmann, R., Zwangsvollstreckungsrecht mit Grundzügen des Insolvenzrechts , 6th edition, Munich 2003, p. 80, paragraph 210).\n\n(28)  – See also Jordans, R., ‘Anmerkung zu EuGH Rs.

Picó i Junoy, J., ‘El abuso del arbitraje por parte de ciertas instituciones arbitrales’, Diario La Ley , Year XXVI, No 6198, also refers to the risk of partiality on the part of an arbitration tribunal. The author sees this as an exceptional ground of refusal of an application for enforcement, provided there is evidence of partiality.\n\n(32)  – See point 51 of this Opinion.\n\n(33)  – See Picó i Junoy, J., loc. cit. (footnote 31).\n\n(34)  – Available on the website of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) at http://www.uncitral.org. Article 5(2)(a) of the Convention provides as follows: ‘Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that: … (b) The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country’. Picó i Junoy, J., loc. cit. (footnote 31), takes the view that Spanish law must be interpreted in the light of this provision of international law. The national court would therefore have to reject the application for enforcement and annul the award.\n\n(35)  – Available on the Council of Europe website. Article 29 of the Convention provides as follows: ‘(1) An arbitral award may be enforced only when it can no longer be contested before arbitrators and when an enforcement formula has been apposed to it by the competent authority on the application of the interested party. (2) The competent authority shall refuse the application if the award or its enforcement is contrary to ordre public or if the dispute was not capable of settlement by arbitration’.\n\n(36)  – In Germany the relevant provisions are contained in the Zivilprozessordnung (Code of Civil procedure) (ZPO). Under Paragraph 1060(1) of the ZPO, enforcement can be effected if the arbitration award is declared enforceable. Paragraph 1060(2) of the ZPO states that an application for enforcement must be rejected and the arbitration award annulled if one of the grounds for annulment set out in Paragraph 1059(2) is satisfied. Paragraph 1059(2)(2)(b) of the ZPO provides for a special ground for annulment. Thereunder, the award may be annulled if the court finds that the outcome of recognition or enforcement of the arbitration award is contrary to public policy. The grounds for annulment laid down in Paragraph 1059(2)(2) of the ZPO must be taken into consideration in enforcement proceedings – of the court’s own motion (Senat, BGHZ 142, 204, 206) – even after the expiry of the time-limits prescribed for bringing annulment proceedings (Paragraph 1059(3) of the ZPO). In Belgium Article 1710(1) of the Code Judiciaire (Judicial Code) provides that the enforcement of an arbitration award may be ordered only by the President of the court of first instance upon application by the party concerned. Article 1710(3) provides that the President must reject the application if, inter alia, the award is contrary to public policy.\n\n(37)  – See, for example, the orders of the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (sección 14) of 28 July 2005 (rec. num. 302/2005) and of 29 July 2005 (rec. num. 155/2005).\n\n(38)  – See the judgment of the Tribunal Supremo of 6 November 2007 (Judgment No 8/2007).

C‑168/05 – Elisa Maria Mostaza Claro gegen Centro Móvil Milenium SL’, Zeitschrift für Gemeinschaftsprivatrecht , 2007, p. 50, which interprets the judgment to the effect that the Court regarded the unfair nature of the clause in question as being so serious that it was a matter of public policy. In the view of Loos, M., ‘Case: ECJ – Mostaza Claro’, European Review of Contract Law , 2007, Vol. 4, p. 443, the Court accorded the mandatory provisions of the directive on consumer protection the status of rules of public policy, as it had done previously in connection with the rules on competition. Poissonnier, G./Tricoit, J.‑P., ‘The CJEC confirms its intention that the national courts should implement Community consumer law’, Petites affiches , September 2007, No 189, p. 15, observe that, unlike the Commission, the Court has not expressly classified Community consumer protection legislation as rules of public policy. Nevertheless, they take the view that the Court’s arguments in that judgment may be interpreted in such a way. In the view of Courbe, P./Brière, C./Dionisi-Peyrusse, A./Jault-Seseke, F./Legros, C., ‘Clause compromissoire et réglementation des clauses abusives: CJCE, 26 octobre 2006’, Petites affiches, 2007, No 152, p. 14, this case-law of the Court of Justice elevates the consumer protection rules in Directive 93/13 to the status of rules of public policy.\n\n(42)  – Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraph 38.\n\n(43)  – Ibid., paragraph 37.\n\n(44)  – Case C‑234/04 [2006] ECR I‑2585, paragraph 20.\n\n(45)  – Case C‑126/97 [1999] ECR I‑3055, paragraphs 46 and 47.\n\n(46)  – Kapferer , cited in footnote 44, paragraph 24.\n\n(47)  – Kapferer , cited in footnote 44, paragraph 22.\n\n(48)  – See point 59 of this Opinion.\n\n(49)  – See point 50 of this Opinion.\n\n(50)  – See also, to that effect, Azparren Lucas, A., ‘Intervención judicial en el arbitraje – La apreciación de oficio de cláusulas abusivas y de la nulidad del convenio arbitral’, Diario La Ley , Year XXVIII, No 6789, who comments on the Mostaza Claro judgment and takes the view that the answer to the question in present case should essentially be based on the same arguments as used in Mostaza Claro . In his view, the Court based that judgment on the principle of effectiveness, according to which the exercise of the rights conferred by the Community legal order must not be rendered excessively difficult.\n\n(51)  – Cited in footnote 8, paragraph 25\n\n(52)  – Cited in footnote 9, paragraphs 32, 33 and 35.\n\n(53)  – See also, to that effect, Van Huffel, M., ‘La condition procédurale des règles de protection des consommateurs: les enseignements des arrets Océano, Heininger et Cofidis de la Cour de Justice’, Revue européenne de droit de la consommation , 2003, p. 97, who takes the view that the aims pursued by the Court of Justice could be achieved only if the national court were required to determine of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair.\n\n(54)  – Mostaza Claro , cited in footnote 3, paragraphs 35 to 38.

Provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to simplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from Member States bound by this Regulation are essential.\n\n…\n\n(11)\n\nThe rules of jurisdiction must be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant’s domicile and jurisdiction must always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject-matter of the litigation or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different linking factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n\n(12)\n\nIn addition to the defendant’s domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice.\n\n…\n\n(14)\n\nThe autonomy of the parties to a contract, other than an insurance, consumer or employment contract, where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed, must be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this Regulation.\n\n(15)\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. ...’\n\n4\n\nArticles 2 to 31 of that regulation, which appear under Chapter II thereof, contain rules on jurisdiction.\n\n5\n\nSection 1 of that chapter, entitled ‘General Provisions’, contains Article 2(1), which is worded as follows:\n\n‘Subject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State.’\n\n6\n\nArticle 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 provides that a person domiciled in a Member State may be sued in another Member State ‘in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur’.\n\n7\n\nArticle 6(1) of that regulation states:\n\n‘A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued:\n\n(1)\n\nwhere he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.’\n\n8\n\nArticle 23(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, which appears in Section 7 of Chapter II, entitled ‘Prorogation of jurisdiction’, provides:\n\n‘If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing; or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves; or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.’\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n9\n\nCDC, a company governed by Belgian law domiciled in Brussels, was established for the purpose of pursuing, both judicially and extra-judicially, claims for damages of undertakings affected by a cartel. By application of 16 March 2009, it brought an action for damages before the referring court against six chemical undertakings which, with the exception of the intervening party and former defendant, Evonik Degussa GmbH (‘Evonik Degussa’), which has its seat in Essen (Germany), were domiciled in five Member States other than the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n10\n\nIn support of its action, in which CDC seeks to have the defendants in the main proceedings ordered to pay damages jointly and severally and to provide disclosure, that undertaking relies on Commission Decision 2006/903/EC of 3 May 2006 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 [EC] and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement against Akzo Nobel NV, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB, EKA Chemicals AB, Degussa AG, Edison SpA, FMC Corporation, FMC Foret S.A., Kemira OYJ, L’Air Liquide SA, Chemoxal SA, Snia SpA, Caffaro Srl, Solvay SA/NV, Solvay Solexis SpA, Total SA, Elf Aquitaine SA and Arkema SA (Case COMP/F/C.38.620 — Hydrogen Peroxide and perborate) ([OJ 2006 L 353, p. 54](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2006:353:TOC)), in which the European Commission found that, in connection with hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate, the defendants in the main proceedings and other undertakings participated in a single and continuous infringement of the prohibition of cartel agreements provided for in Article 81 EC and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. According to that decision, the infringement started on 31 January 1994 at the latest and lasted at least until 31 December 2000. It consisted principally in exchanging important and confidential market and/or company-relevant information, limiting and/or controlling production, allocating markets and customers and fixing and monitoring prices as part of multilateral and/or bilateral meetings and telephone conversations held at regular and irregular intervals mainly in Belgium, Germany and France.\n\n11\n\nIn that regard, CDC invokes agreements concerning the transfer of claims for damages entered into with 32 undertakings domiciled in 13 different Member States of the European Union or of the European Economic Area (‘the EEA’), some of which undertakings had previously concluded similar transfer agreements with 39 other undertakings. The undertakings at issue operate in the industrial pulp and paper processing industry. The applicant submits that, from 1994 to 2006, those undertakings purchased substantial quantities of hydrogen peroxide in various EU and EEA Member States, some undertakings having supplied hydrogen peroxide to plants in several EU Member States. According to the defendants in the main proceedings, some of the contracts of sale included agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction.\n\n12\n\nIn September 2009, CDC withdrew its action against Evonik Degussa following a settlement with that undertaking. In late 2009, the remaining defendants in the main proceedings joined the former defendant and the firms Chemoxal SA and Edison S.p.A. to the proceedings. Relying on various agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction provided for in some of the sales contracts by which they were bound to the undertakings allegedly victims of the defendants’ cartel agreements, the defendants in the main proceedings contended that the referring court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.\n\n13\n\nIn that context, the referring court considers that it could have international jurisdiction only by virtue of Articles 5(3) and 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001. If the conditions for such jurisdiction were satisfied, CDC would be free to sue the defendants in the main proceedings before one of the courts deemed to have jurisdiction in accordance with those provisions, provided that the jurisdiction of those courts is not validly excluded in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation No 44/2001 or by an arbitration agreement.\n\n14\n\nIn those circumstances the Landgericht Dortmund decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘1.\n\nIs Article 6(1) of [Regulation No 44/2001] to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action in which a defendant domiciled in the same State as the court and other defendants domiciled in other Member States … are together the subject of an application for disclosure and damages on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the … Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings?\n\nIs it significant in this regard if the action against the defendant domiciled in the same State as the court is withdrawn after having been served on all the defendants, before the expiry of the periods prescribed by the court for lodging a defence and before the start of the first hearing?\n\n2.\n\nIs Article 5(3) of Regulation … No 44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for disclosure and damages brought against defendants domiciled in a number of Member States … on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, the harmful event occurred in relation to each defendant and in relation to all heads of damage claimed or the overall loss in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented?\n\n3.\n\nIn the case of actions for damages for infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices contained in Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, does the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in [EU] law allow account to be taken of arbitration and jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of Regulation … No 44/2001 in relation to all the defendants and/or all or some of the claims brought?’\n\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\nThe first question\n\n15\n\nBy its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it may, under that provision, be expedient to hear and determine applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, as found by a decision of the Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for in EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised.\n\n16\n\nIn order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind from the outset that Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted independently, by reference to its scheme and purpose (see judgment in Reisch Montage, [C‑103/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [29](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point29)).\n\n17\n\nThe rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 6(1) provides that a person may, where he is one of a number of defendants, be sued in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings (judgments in Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [73](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point73), and in Sapir and Others, [C‑645/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:228](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

rule, because it derogates from the principle stated in Article 2 of Regulation No 44/2001 that jurisdiction is based on the defendant’s domicile, must be strictly interpreted and cannot be given an interpretation going beyond the cases expressly envisaged by that regulation (see judgment in Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [74](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point74)).\n\n19\n\nIn accordance with recitals 12 and 15 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001, that rule of jurisdiction meets the wish to facilitate the sound administration of justice, to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and thus to avoid irreconcilable outcomes if cases are decided separately (judgment in Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

order for Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 to apply, it is necessary to ascertain whether, between various claims brought by the same applicant against various defendants, there is a connection of such a kind that it is expedient to determine those actions together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings (see judgments in Freeport, [C‑98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

In that regard, in order for judgments to be regarded as irreconcilable, it is not sufficient that there be a divergence in the outcome of the dispute, but that divergence must also arise in the context of the same situation of fact and law (see judgments in Freeport, [C‑98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40); Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [79](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point79); and in Sapir and Others, [C‑645/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:228](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [43](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point43)).\n\n21\n\nThe requirement that the same situation of fact and law must arise is satisfied in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings. Despite the fact that the defendants in the main proceedings participated in the implementation of the cartel at issue by concluding and performing contracts under it, in different places and at different times, according to Decision 2006/903 upon which the claims in the main proceedings are based, the cartel agreement amounted to a single and continuous infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. That decision does not, however, determine the requirements for holding the defendants liable in tort, jointly and severally as the case may be, since this is to be determined by the national law of each Member State.\n\n22\n\nAs regards, finally, the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings, since the requirements for holding those participating in an unlawful cartel liable in tort may differ between the various national laws, there would be a risk of irreconcilable judgments if actions were brought before the courts of various Member States by a party allegedly adversely affected by a cartel.\n\n23\n\nNevertheless, the Court points out that, even in the case where various laws are, by virtue of the rules of private international law of the court seised, applicable to the actions for damages brought by CDC against the defendants in the main proceedings, such a difference in legal basis does not, in itself, preclude the application of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, provided that it was foreseeable by the defendants that they might be sued in the Member State where at least one of them is domiciled (see judgement in Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [84](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point84)).\n\n24\n\nThat latter condition is fulfilled in the case of a binding decision of the Commission finding there to have been a single infringement of EU law and, on the basis of that finding, holding each participant liable for the loss resulting from the tortious actions of those participating in the infringement. In those circumstances, the participants could have expected to be sued in the courts of a Member State in which one of them is domiciled.\n\n25\n\nIt must therefore be considered that determining separately actions for damages against several undertakings domiciled in different Member States which, contrary to EU competition law, participated in a single and continuous cartel may lead to irreconcilable judgments within the meaning of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n26\n\nThat said, it remains to be considered to what extent the applicant’s withdrawal of its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same Member State as the court seised is capable of rendering the rule of jurisdiction provided for in Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 inapplicable.\n\n27\n\nAccording to settled case-law, that rule cannot be interpreted as allowing an applicant to make a claim against a number of defendants for the sole purpose of removing one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled (judgments in Reisch Montage, [C‑103/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point32), and in Painer, [C‑145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [78](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point78)).\n\n28\n\nThe Court has nevertheless stated that, where claims brought against various defendants are connected within the meaning of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 when the proceedings are instituted, the rule of jurisdiction laid down in that provision is applicable without there being any further need to establish separately that the claims were not brought with the sole object of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where one of the defendants is domiciled (see judgment in Freeport, [C‑98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [54](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point54)).\n\n29\n\nIt follows that where, when proceedings are instituted, claims are connected within the meaning of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, the court seised of the case can find that the rule of jurisdiction laid down in that provision has potentially been circumvented only where there is firm evidence to support the conclusion that the applicant artificially fulfilled, or prolonged the fulfilment of, that provision’s applicability.\n\n30\n\nIn the case in the main proceedings, some of the parties allege that, before the action in the proceedings was brought, an out-of-court settlement was reached between the applicant in the main proceedings and Evonik Degussa, whose seat is in Germany, and that the parties purposefully delayed the formal conclusion of that settlement until proceedings had been instituted, for the sole purpose of securing the jurisdiction of the court seised of the case as against the other defendants in the main proceedings.\n\n31\n\nIn order to be able to exclude the applicability of the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, an allegation of that nature must nevertheless be supported by firm evidence that, at the time that proceedings were instituted, the parties concerned had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision’s applicability.\n\n32\n\nAlthough it is for the court seised of the case to assess such evidence, it must nevertheless be made clear that simply holding negotiations with a view to concluding an out-of-court settlement does not in itself prove such collusion. However, it would be otherwise if it transpired that such a settlement had, in fact, been concluded, but that it had been concealed in order to create the impression that the conditions of application of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 had been fulfilled.\n\n33\n\nIn the light of the above, the answer to the first question is that Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as established in that provision, can apply in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, which has been established by a decision of the Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for under EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised, unless it is found that, at the time the proceedings were instituted, the applicant and that defendant had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision’s applicability.\n\nThe second question\n\n34\n\nBy its second question, the referring court asks whether Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States on grounds of a single and continuous infringement, as found by the Commission, of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each defendant and in relation to all damages claimed in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented.\n\n35\n\nGiven that the circumstances of the present case are characterised by the consolidation of a number of potential claims for damages brought by the applicant in the main proceedings which had been assigned to the applicant by several undertakings allegedly victims of the Hydrogen Peroxide cartel, it should be pointed out from the outset that the transfer of claims by the initial creditor cannot, by itself, have an impact on the determination of the court having jurisdiction under Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 (judgment in ÖFAB, [C‑147/12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A490\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:490](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [58](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point58)).\n\n36\n\nIt follows that the location of the harmful event must be assessed for each claim for damages independently of any subsequent assignment or consolidation.\n\n37\n\nIn that regard, the Court notes that Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted independently and strictly (judgment in Kolassa, [C‑375/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

that the expression ‘place where the harmful event occurred or may occur’ Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 is intended to cover both the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it, so that the defendant may be sued, at the option of the applicant, in the courts for either of those places (judgments in Melzer, [C‑228/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point25), and in Kolassa, [C‑375/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

with settled case-law, the rule of special jurisdiction laid down in Article 5(3) of that regulation is based on the existence of a particularly close linking factor between the dispute and the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur, which justifies the attribution of jurisdiction to those courts for reasons relating to the sound administration of justice and the efficacious conduct of proceedings (judgments in Melzer, [C‑228/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

HCF, [C‑387/12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A215\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:215](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A215\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

relating to tort and delict and quasi-delict, the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur are usually the most appropriate for deciding the case, in particular on the grounds of proximity and ease of taking evidence (judgment in Melzer, [C‑228/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

identification of one of the linking factors recognised by the case-law referred to in paragraph 38 above must therefore make it possible to establish the jurisdiction of the court objectively best placed to determine whether the elements that constitute liability do in fact exist, from which it follows that only the court within whose jurisdiction the relevant linking factor is situated may validly be seised (judgments in Coty Germany, [C‑360/12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1318\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:1318](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1318\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1318\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point48), and in Kolassa, [C‑375/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [47](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point47)).\n\n42\n\nIt needs to be examined, in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, where the linking factors capable of establishing the jurisdiction of the court in matters relating to tort and delict and quasi-delict lie.\n\nThe place of the causal event\n\n43\n\nWith regard to the place of the causal event, it must be pointed out at the outset that, in circumstances such as those in the present case, the buyers were supplied by various participants in the cartel within the scope of their contractual relations. However, the event giving rise to the alleged loss did not consist in a potential breach of contractual obligations, but in a restriction of the buyer’s freedom of contract as a result of that cartel in the sense that that restriction prevented the buyer from being supplied at a price determined by the rules of supply and demand.\n\n44\n\nIn those circumstances, the place of a causal event of loss consisting in additional costs that a buyer had to pay because a cartel has distorted market prices can be identified, in the abstract, as the place of the conclusion of the cartel. Once concluded, the participants in a cartel ensure through action or forbearance that there is no competition and that prices are distorted. Where the place of a cartel’s conclusion is known, it would be consistent with the aims outlined in paragraph 39 above for the courts of that place to have jurisdiction.\n\n45\n\nThat conclusion is, however, not relevant in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, according to the findings of the Commission as set out in the order for reference, it is not possible to identify a single place where the cartel at issue was concluded since the cartel consisted of a number of collusive agreements concluded during various meetings and discussions which took place in various places in the European Union.\n\n46\n\nThe above considerations are without prejudice to a situation in which, among several agreements that, as a whole, amounted to the unlawful cartel at issue, there was one in particular which was the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer. In that case, the courts in whose jurisdiction that particular agreement was concluded would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the loss thereby inflicted upon that buyer.\n\n47\n\nIn the latter case, as well as in that in which the referring court were to find that the cartel at issue in the main proceedings was nevertheless definitively concluded in its jurisdiction, the issue still needs to be addressed as to whether several participants in that cartel can be sued before the same court.\n\n48\n\nThe Court has indeed held on another set of facts that Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 does not allow the courts of the place where a harmful event occurred which is imputed to one of the presumed perpetrators of damage, who is not a party to the dispute, to take jurisdiction in an action against another presumed perpetrator of that damage who has not acted within the jurisdiction of that court (judgment in Melzer, [C‑228/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [41](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point41)).\n\n49\n\nHowever, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, there is no reason for preventing several perpetrators from being sued together before the same court.\n\n50\n\nIt follows that jurisdiction by virtue of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 to adjudicate, on the basis of the causal event and with regard to all of the perpetrators of an unlawful cartel which allegedly resulted in loss, depends upon the identification, in the jurisdiction of the court seised of the matter, of a specific event during which either that cartel was definitively concluded or one agreement in particular was made which was the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer.\n\nThe place where the damage occurred\n\n51\n\nAs outlined in paragraph 41 above, the identification of the place where the damage occurred must make it possible to establish the jurisdiction of the courts objectively best placed to determine whether the constitutive elements that found the liability of the person sued are in fact fulfilled.\n\n52\n\nAccording to the settled case-law of the Court, the place where the damage occurred is the place where the alleged damage actually manifests itself (see judgment in Zuid-Chemie, [C‑189/08](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2009:475](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point27)). As for loss consisting in additional costs incurred because of artificially high prices, such as the price of the hydrogen peroxide supplied by the cartel at issue in the main proceedings, that place is identifiable only for each alleged victim taken individually and is located, in general, at that victim’s registered office.\n\n53\n\nThat place fully guarantees the efficacious conduct of potential proceedings, given that the assessment of a claim for damages for loss allegedly inflicted upon a specific undertaking as a result of an unlawful cartel, as already found by the Commission in a binding decision, essentially depends on factors specifically relating to the situation of that undertaking. In those circumstances, the courts in whose jurisdiction that undertaking has its registered office are manifestly best suited to adjudicate such a claim.\n\n54\n\nThose courts, as identified, have jurisdiction to hear an action brought either against any one of the participants in the cartel or against several of them for the whole of the loss inflicted upon that undertaking as a result of additional costs that it had to pay to be supplied with products covered by the cartel concerned.\n\n55\n\nHowever, given that the jurisdiction of the court seised of the matter by virtue of the place where the loss occurred is limited to the loss suffered by the undertaking whose registered office is located in its jurisdiction, an applicant such as CDC, who has consolidated several undertakings’ potential claims for damages, would therefore, in accordance with the case-law set out in paragraph 35 above, need to bring separate actions for the loss suffered by each of those undertakings before the courts with jurisdiction for their respective registered offices.\n\n56\n\nIn the light of the above, the answer to the second question is that Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States as a result of a single and continuous infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, which has been established by the Commission, in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each alleged victim on an individual basis and each of the victims can, by virtue of Article 5(3), choose to bring an action before the courts of the place in which the cartel was definitively concluded or, as the case may be, the place in which one agreement in particular was concluded which is identifiable as the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly suffered, or before the courts of the place where its own registered office is located.\n\nThe third question\n\n57\n\nBy its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 23(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 and the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements in EU law must, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, be interpreted as allowing account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of that regulation.\n\n58\n\nBefore assessing that question, it must be made clear that, with regard to certain terms derogating from otherwise applicable rules allegedly contained in the contracts at issue but which do not fall within the scope of application of Regulation No 44/2001, the Court does not have sufficient information at its disposal in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court.\n\n59\n\nWith regard to the terms at issue in the third question which fall within the scope of that regulation, it is to be observed that, in the context of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed in Brussels on 27 September 1968 ([OJ 1972, L 299, p. 32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1972:299:TOC)), the Court has stated that, by concluding an agreement on the choice of court under Article 17 of the Brussels Convention, the parties may derogate, not only from the general jurisdiction under Article 2 thereof, but also from the special jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of that convention (see judgment in Estasis Saloti di Colzani, [24/76](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1976:177](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point7)).\n\n60\n\nSince the interpretation given by the Court in respect of the provisions of that convention is also valid for those of Regulation No 44/2001 whenever the provisions of those instruments may be regarded as equivalent, it must be found that such is the case as regards the first paragraph of Article 17 of the Brussels Convention and Article 23(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, which are drafted in almost identical terms (judgment in Refcomp, [C‑543/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:62](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point19) and [20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point20)).\n\n61\n\nIt must therefore be concluded that the court seised of a matter can, in principle, be bound by a jurisdiction clause derogating from the rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation No 44/2001 which was concluded by the parties under Article 23(1) of that regulation.\n\n62\n\nThat conclusion cannot be called into question by the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements. First, the Court has already held that the substantive rules applicable to the substance of a case must not affect the validity of a jurisdiction clause agreed in accordance with Article 17 of the Brussels Convention (see, to that effect, judgment in Castelletti, [C‑159/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:142](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [51](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point51)). In accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 60 above, that interpretation is also relevant to Article 23 of Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n63\n\nSecond, it must be considered that the court seised of the matter cannot, without undermining the aim of Regulation No 44/2001, refuse to take into account a jurisdiction clause which has satisfied the requirements of Article 23 of that regulation solely on the ground that it considers that the court with jurisdiction under that clause would not give full effect to the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements by not allowing a victim of the cartel to obtain full compensation for the loss it suffered. On the contrary, it must be considered that the system of legal remedies in each Member State, together with the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, affords a sufficient guarantee to individuals in that respect (see, by analogy, judgment in Renault, [C‑38/98](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2000:225](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point23)).\n\n64\n#addthis #important\nIn a case such as that in the main proceedings, the court before which the action is brought must, nevertheless, ensure that the clauses at issue actually bind the applicant in the main proceedings before examining the requirements of form laid down in Article 23 of Regulation No 44/2001. As the Court has already made clear, a jurisdiction clause incorporated in a contract may, in principle, produce effects only in the relations between the parties who have given their agreement to the conclusion of that contract. In order for a third party to rely on such a clause it is, in principle, necessary that the third party has given his consent to that effect (judgment in Refcomp, [C‑543/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2013:62](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [29](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point29)).\n\n65\n\nOnly where a party not privy to the original contract had succeeded to an original contracting party’s rights and obligations in accordance with national substantive law as established by the application of the rules of private international law of the court seised of the matter could that third party nevertheless be bound by a jurisdiction clause to which it had not agreed (see, to that effect, judgment in Coreck, [C‑387/98](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2000:606](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point24), [25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point25) and [30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point30)).\n\n66\n\nIf the applicant to the main proceedings did prove to be bound by the clauses at issue, it would be necessary to ascertain whether they did, in fact, derogate from the referring court’s jurisdiction as far as the case in the main proceedings is concerned.\n\n67\n\nIn that regard, it is for the national court to interpret the clause conferring jurisdiction invoked before it in order to determine which disputes fall within its scope (judgments in Powell Duffryn, [C‑214/89](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1992:115](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point37), and in Benincasa, [C‑269/95](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1997:337](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [31](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point31)).\n\n68\n\nA jurisdiction clause can concern only disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, which limits the scope of an agreement conferring jurisdiction solely to disputes which arise from the legal relationship in connection with which the agreement was entered into. The purpose of that requirement is to avoid a party being taken by surprise by the assignment of jurisdiction to a given forum as regards all disputes which may arise out of its relationship with the other party to the contract and stem from a relationship other than that in connection with which the agreement conferring jurisdiction was made (see, to that effect, judgment in Powell Duffryn, [C‑214/89](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1992:115](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [31](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point31)).\n\n69\n\nIn the light of that purpose, the referring court must, in particular, regard a clause which abstractly refers to all disputes arising from contractual relationships as not extending to a dispute relating to the tortious liability that one party allegedly incurred as a result of its participation in an unlawful cartel.\n\n70\n\nGiven that the undertaking which suffered the loss could not reasonably foresee such litigation at the time that it agreed to the jurisdiction clause and that that undertaking had no knowledge of the unlawful cartel at that time, such litigation cannot be regarded as stemming from a contractual relationship. Such a clause would not therefore have validly derogated from the referring court’s jurisdiction.\n\n71\n\nBy contrast, where a clause refers to disputes in connection with liability incurred as a result of an infringement of competition law and designates the courts of a Member State other than the Member State of the referring court, the latter ought to decline its own jurisdiction, even where that clause entails disregarding the special rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and/or 6 of Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n72\n\nConsequently, the answer to the third question is that Article 23(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as allowing, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, even if the effect thereof is a derogation from the rules on international jurisdiction provided for in Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of that regulation, provided that those clauses refer to disputes concerning liability incurred as a result of an infringement of competition law.\n\nCosts\n\n73\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n \n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n \n\n1.\n\nArticle 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as established in that provision, can apply in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, which has been established by a decision of the European Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for under EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised, unless it is found that, at the time the proceedings were instituted, the applicant and that defendant had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision’s applicability.\n\n \n\n2.\n\nArticle 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States as a result of a single and continuous infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992, which has been established by the European Commission, in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each alleged victim on an individual basis and each of the victims can, by virtue of Article 5(3), choose to bring an action before the courts of the place in which the cartel was definitively concluded or, as the case may be, the place in which one agreement in particular was concluded which is identifiable as the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly suffered, or before the courts of the place where its own registered office is located.\n\n \n\n3.\n\nArticle 23(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as allowing, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992, account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, even if the effect thereof is a derogation from the rules on international jurisdiction provided for in Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of that regulation, provided that those clauses refer to disputes concerning liability incurred as a result of an infringement of competition law.\n\n \n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n( [*1](#c-ECR_62013CJ0352_EN_01-E0001) ) Language

agreements — Effect of the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Union law’\n\nI – Introduction\n\n1.\n\nThe reference for a preliminary ruling from the Landgericht Dortmund (Regional Court, Dortmund, Germany) concerns the interpretation of Articles 5(3) and 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( [2](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0002) ) (the ‘Brussels I Regulation’) and, which is unusual, the interplay between those provisions and the guiding principles of European Union (‘EU’) competition law relating to Article 101 TFEU.\n\n2.\n\nThis request was made in the context of an action for disclosure and damages brought before the German court, by an applicant domiciled in Belgium, against several companies domiciled in various Member States — only one in Germany — which had participated in an infringement declared by a decision of the European Commission to be in breach of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article 81 EC (now Article 101 TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992. ( [3](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0003) )\n\n3.\n\nThe parties disagreeing as to the international jurisdiction of the referring court, the latter seeks the Court’s interpretation on three main points.\n\n4.\n\nIn the first place, the referring court questions the applicability, in a dispute such as that before it, of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, which authorises an extension of the jurisdiction of the court seised so that it may also deliver judgments in actions relating to defendants other than the defendant domiciled within its jurisdiction, in order to avoid irreconcilable judgments. In addition, those issues are raised in the particular case in which, as here, the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the Member State of the court seised, which can be regarded as the ‘anchor defendant’ in that it alone can provide grounds for the court’s jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nIn the second place, in terms of jurisdiction in matters of tort or delict falling within Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, the Court has been asked whether the ‘place where the harmful event occurred’ within the meaning of that provision must be interpreted as allowing that jurisdiction to apply with respect to all the defendants in respect of all the alleged damage, in every one of the numerous places in the Member States in which the unlawful cartel agreement was entered into and/or put into effect and in which, according to the applicant, purchasers’ freedom of choice was thereby restricted.\n\n6.\n\nIn the third place, the referring court appears to start from the premise that some of the clauses conferring jurisdiction, which may fall under Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation and/or the arbitration agreements invoked by the defendants in the main proceedings, cover the claims for damages made in this case. The referring court has asked the Court to state whether, in the case in point, the principle of effective implementation of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices set out in Article 101 TFEU can preclude those clauses being invoked against the claimant for damages when the action has been brought before one of the courts having jurisdiction under Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n7.\n\nI would emphasise that this case is the first in which the Court has been asked to adjudicate directly on the interaction between, on the one hand, provisions of primary law guaranteeing freedom of competition within the European Union and, on the other, provisions of EU private international law relating to jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, in a dispute characterised by a far-reaching cartel agreement which has myriad participants and injured parties and has distorted competition throughout the internal market.\n\n8.\n\nFirst of all, I must point out that it appears to me that the Brussels I Regulation, the aim of which is to create a system of rules of jurisdiction for the Union in respect of cross-border disputes in civil and commercial matters, is not fully geared towards ensuring effective private implementation of the Union’s competition law (or ‘private enforcement’, as it is usually called in this field) ( [4](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0004) ) in circumstances such as those in this case.\n\n9.\n\nThe application of certain provisions of that regulation is likely to lead to a territorial division of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States which might, on the one hand, be inadequate from the point of view of the geographical scope of EU competition law or, on the other hand, make it more difficult for persons adversely affected by unlawful restrictions of competition to seek and obtain full reparation for the damage that they have suffered. It seems to me, therefore, possible that the authors of such restrictions could use those provisions of international private law to bring about a situation in which the civil-law consequences of a single, serious infringement of Union competition rules are to be determined in the context of a series of actions scattered across the various Member States.\n\n10.\n\nThe general conclusion that I shall draw from this request for interpretation is that, de lege ferenda, because of the particular repercussions which cross-border anti-competitive practices are likely to have in terms of judicial cooperation in civil matters, especially when they are complex, as they are in the main proceedings, it would be advisable for the EU legislature to envisage incorporating in the Brussels I Regulation a rule of jurisdiction apt to cover such practices, ( [5](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0005) ) on the lines of the conflict-of-laws provision which applies specifically to obligations deriving from acts restrictive of competition under the regulation usually known as ‘Rome II’. ( [6](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0006) )\n\nII – Legal context\n\n11.\n\nRecitals 11, 12, 14 and 15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation state:\n\n‘11.\n\nThe rules of jurisdiction must be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant’s domicile and jurisdiction must always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject-matter of the litigation or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different linking factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nIn addition to the defendant’s domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice.\n\n…\n\n14.\n\nThe autonomy of the parties to a contract, other than an insurance, consumer or employment contract, where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed, must be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this Regulation.\n\n15.\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. …’\n\n12.\n\nArticle 1(2)(d) of the Brussels I Regulation excludes arbitration from the scope of the regulation.\n\n13.\n\nChapter II of the regulation lays down a series of rules concerning jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters. Article 2(1) of the regulation lays down the principle that ‘[s]ubject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State’.\n\n14.\n\nArticle 5(3) of that regulation, which is part of Section 2 of Chapter II, entitled ‘Special jurisdiction’, provides that ‘a person domiciled in a Member State may, in another Member State, be sued … in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur’.\n\n15.\n\nArticle 6(1) in that Section adds that ‘[a] person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued … where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings’.\n\n16.\n\nArticle 23(1) and (5), in Section 7 of that Chapter, entitled ‘Prorogation of jurisdiction’, is worded as follows:\n\n‘1.   If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. …\n\n…\n\n5.   Agreements conferring jurisdiction shall have no legal force if they are contrary to the provisions of Articles 13, 17 or 21, or if the courts whose jurisdiction they purport to exclude have exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article 22.’\n\nIII – Main proceedings, questions referred for a preliminary ruling and procedure before the Court\n\n17.\n\nThe action in the main proceedings is based on a decision of 3 May 2006 ( [7](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0007) ) in which the Commission decided that several companies supplying hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium perborate ( [8](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0008) ) had participated in a single and continuous infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article 81 EC (Article 101 TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, for which reason some of those companies were ordered to pay fines. ( [9](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0009) )\n\n18.\n\nThat decision indicated that the period of infringement taken into account lasted from 31 January 1994 until 31 December 2000 and covered the whole territory of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the main, the cartel agreement in question had involved exchanges of information between competitors concerning prices and sales volumes, pricing agreements and production capacity reductions, and monitoring of the implementation of anti-competitive agreements. The referring court stressed that those concerted practices took place in the context of meetings and telephone calls which were held principally in Belgium, France and Germany and that the authors of the infringement had participated in different ways but knew that their secret actions to restrict competition were unlawful.\n\n19.\n\nCartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA (‘CDC’) is a company established in Belgium, whose object is to uphold rights to damages transferred to it, directly or indirectly, by some of the undertakings allegedly harmed in connection with that infringement. ( [10](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0010) )\n\n20.\n\nBy application of 16 March 2009, CDC brought a joint action for damages before the Landgericht, Dortmund, against six of the companies fined by the Commission, which were established in various Member States, but only one of them, namely: Evonik Degussa GmbH (‘Evonik Degussa’), which has its registered office in Essen (Germany), ( [11](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0011) ) in the state of the court seised.\n\n21.\n\nIn September 2009, following notification of the action to all the defendants in the main proceedings but before the expiry of the period prescribed for lodging statements in defence and the opening of the oral procedure, CDC withdrew its action against the German company, as the result of an out-of-court settlement. At the end of 2009, the remaining defendants in the proceedings joined Evonik Degussa and two other companies affected by the Commission decision to the proceedings. ( [12](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0012) )\n\n22.\n\nCDC submitted that, from 1994 to 2006, the assignor undertakings had purchased, from suppliers having participated in the unlawful cartel, considerable quantities of hydrogen peroxide that were supplied on the basis of contracts to various Member States of the Union and the EEA.\n\n23.\n\nThe defendants in the main proceedings, pleading that some of those supply contracts contained arbitration and jurisdiction clauses, all raised the objection that the court lacked international jurisdiction.\n\n24.\n\nThe Landgericht, Dortmund, held that it could have jurisdiction only on the basis of Articles 6(1) and 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, unless such jurisdiction was not validly excluded in accordance with a jurisdiction clause under Article 23 of that regulation, or by an arbitration agreement. Accordingly, in a decision lodged on 26 June 2013, it stayed the proceedings and referred the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n(a)\n\nIs Article 6(1) of the [Brussels I] Regulation to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action in which a defendant domiciled in the same State as the court and other defendants domiciled in other Member States of the European Union are together the subject of an application for disclosure and damages on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient to hear and determine those claims together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings?\n\n(b)\n\nIs it significant in this regard if the action against the defendant domiciled in the same State as the court is withdrawn after having been served on all the defendants, before the expiry of the periods prescribed by the court for lodging a defence and before the start of the first hearing?\n\n2.   Is Article 5(3) of the [Brussels I] Regulation to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for disclosure and damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States of the European Union on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, the harmful event occurred, in relation to each defendant and in relation to all heads of damage claimed or the overall loss, in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented?\n\n3.   In the case of actions for damages for infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices contained in Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, does the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in EU law allow account to be taken of arbitration and jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article 5(3) and/or Article 6(1) of the [Brussels I] Regulation in relation to all the defendants and/or all or some of the claims brought?’\n\n25.\n\nWritten observations were lodged by CDC, by Evonik Degussa solely in relation to subparagraph (b) of the first question, by Akzo Nobel, Solvay, Kemira, FMC Foret and Edison, by the French Government solely in relating to the third question, and by the Commission. By letter of 26 August 2013, the referring court informed the Court that CDC had withdrawn its action against Arkema France. No hearing was held.\n\nIV – Analysis\n\nA – Preliminary remarks\n\n26.\n\nIn the first place, as regards the general issues arising in this case, I wish to emphasise that the Brussels I Regulation is not, in itself, intended to give effect to the rules of EU competition law. According to, inter alia, recitals 1, 2 and 6 in the preamble, the purpose of that regulation is to promote ‘the sound operation of the internal market’ and to ensure ‘the free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters’ by creating a unified framework for disputes in that field concerning both the allocation of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States and the recognition and enforcement of the judgments delivered by those courts.\n\n27.\n\nHowever, I consider that the interpretation and application of the Brussels I Regulation must make it possible to preserve the full effectiveness of provisions of EU competition law, which are vitally important for the internal market and constitute a fundamental element of the EU economic constitution ( [13](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0013) ) because, as the Court has already stressed, Article 85 of the EC Treaty, now Article 101 TFEU, is a ‘fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community, and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market’. ( [14](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0014) ) Furthermore, the procedural rules of EU law must, to a certain extent, serve the substantive rules of EU law, in the sense that the former are an instrument which enables the rights and obligations of private and public persons to be made tangible, particularly in terms of the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, as affirmed in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. ( [15](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0015) )\n\n28.\n\nIn this connection, it must be held, first, that the main proceedings concern the consequences which are liable to result, in civil law, from an offence consisting of a single continuous infringement of Article 101 TFEU committed by several companies established in the territory of different Member States, the numerous persons adversely affected by it also being established in different Member States.\n\n29.\n\nThe emergence of players on the judicial scene, such as the applicant in the main proceedings, whose aim it is to combine assets based on claims for damages resulting from infringements of EU competition law, ( [16](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0016) ) seems to me to show that, in the case of the more complex barriers to competition, it is not reasonable for the persons adversely affected themselves individually to sue those responsible for a barrier of that type. ( [17](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0017) )\n\n30.\n\nNext, I would point out that, compensation for persons injured by an agreement or practice prohibited by EU law is an entitlement, the essence of which is governed by that law, in accordance with the decisions in Courage and Crehan ( [18](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0018) ) and Manfredi and Others ( [19](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0019) ) concerning the interpretation of Article 81 EC (Article 101 TFEU). That applies both to the existence of that right and to its basic substantive scope, which includes, inter alia, the possibility for injured persons of receiving compensation not only for the actual loss (damnum emergens) but also for the loss of profit (lucrum cessans) occasioned by such an agreement or practice, together with interest. ( [20](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0020) )\n\n31.\n\nNone the less, as the Court has pointed out, having regard to the current state of EU law, the rules for exercising that right to full compensation remain within the remit of the Member States, provided that the latter observe the principle of equivalence and the principle of effectiveness laid down in that case-law. ( [21](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0021) ) This retention of legislative competence for the national legislatures in this sphere applies in particular to procedural rules, but no longer holds true for the rules on conflict of laws, because the ‘law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a restriction of competition’ must in future be determined by the Rome II Regulation. ( [22](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0022) )\n\n32.\n\nBy analogy, the principle of effectiveness of actions for damages so laid down in relation to provisions of national law ought, in my view, a fortiori to guide the interpretation and application of the Brussels I Regulation, in that that regulation, being an instrument of secondary law adopted by the Union itself, must not be interpreted in such a way as to make it impossible in practice or excessively difficult in the context of an unlawful cross-border cartel agreement ( [23](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0023) ) to give effect to that prerogative, which is conferred on the basis of primary law.\n\n33.\n\nIn the second place, I would stress that it is undisputed, as far as the Court’s case-law is concerned, that legal action which seeks, as in the present case, to obtain compensation from undertakings which have infringed Article 101 TFEU is ‘civil and commercial in nature’, within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Brussels I Regulation. ( [24](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0024) )\n\n34.\n\nIn the third place, it must be noted that, in so far as, in relations between Member States, the Brussels I Regulation replaced the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 27 September 1968 ( [25](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0025) ) (the ‘Brussels Convention’), the Court’s interpretation of the provisions of the latter convention applies to the provisions of that regulation too, whenever the provisions of the two instruments may be regarded as equivalent. ( [26](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0026) )\n\n35.\n\nIn the light of the Court’s case-law, this equivalence appears to me to have been established for each of the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation referred to in this request for a preliminary ruling, namely: Articles 5(3), 6(1) and 23(1), given that the content of the corresponding provisions of the Brussels Convention, namely: Articles 5(3) and 6(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 17 of the latter, is at the very least similar in substance, if not identical. ( [27](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0027) )\n\n36.\n\nIn the fourth place, I would point out that, in accordance with the objectives of the Brussels Convention, which are also those of the Brussels I Regulation, it is necessary, on the one hand, to avoid, as far as possible, multiplication of the bases of jurisdiction in relation to one and the same legal relationship and, on the other hand, to guarantee legal certainty for applicants and defendants alike through the ability to predict with certainty which court has jurisdiction, particularly by allowing the court seised to give a ruling regarding its own jurisdiction without having to examine the substance of the case. ( [28](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0028) )\n\n37.\n\nFinally, it appear to me that civil actions for damages resulting from an infringement of competition law are for the most part considered to be a question of tort or delict, ( [29](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0029) ) although a contractual basis for such actions is not, however, precluded a priori, at least not in some national legal systems. ( [30](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0030) )\n\n38.\n\nI therefore intend to start my examination of the problems submitted for the Court’s scrutiny with the second question referred, relating to Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, which makes provision for a special basis of jurisdiction for civil claims for damages based on tortious liability (B). I shall then examine the first question, relating to Article 6(1) of that regulation, which provides for extended jurisdiction in the case of connected claims brought against several defendants (C). Lastly, I shall examine the third question, which relates to those two provisions and to specific aspects of the choice of court, in relation to the principle of full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements and concerted practices under EU law (D).\n\nB – Interpretation of Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation (second question)\n\n39.\n\nIn essence, the second question invites the Court to give a ruling on the ambit of Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation and on the extent of the jurisdiction which could be derived from the special rule provided for in that provision (1). I consider, bearing in mind in particular the objectives of that provision, that the application of the latter is problematic and ought even to be precluded in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings, whose special characteristics are undeniable (2).\n\n1. The problem submitted to the Court\n\n40.\n\nIn the light of its order for reference, the referring court takes it for granted that the action for damages and disclosure pending before it is a ‘matter relating to tort or delict’ pursuant to Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation and that its own jurisdiction can therefore be based on that provision. Such a classification of actions of this type has recently been accepted by the Court. ( [31](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0031) )\n\n41.\n\nFurthermore, that court rightly points out that settled case-law makes it clear that, in the case of complex tort or delict, ( [32](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0032) ) the expression ‘place where the harmful event occurred’, ( [33](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0033) ) used in Article 5(3), refers both to the place of the causal event giving rise to the alleged damage and to the place where that damage occurred, meaning that the applicant can elect to sue the defendants in the court for either of those two places. ( [34](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0034) ) It also points out that, when more than one harmful event is alleged, a court having jurisdiction on the basis of the latter connecting factor may, however, rule only on claims regarding harm caused in the territory of the State of the court seised. ( [35](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0035) )\n\n42.\n\nThe referring court expresses doubts as to the way in which the alternative criteria so defined by the Court should be given effect in the proceedings before it, given that the contributions of the cartel members which led to an infringement of Article 101 TFEU and to the alleged damage have the particular feature of differing in both place and time. The court is uncertain, principally, whether Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation permits an action to be brought in every ‘place where the harmful event occurred’, within the meaning of that provision, and against every member of the unlawful cartel, in respect of the overall damage caused by that cartel, even when some of the defendants were not directly involved in the territory of the Member State of the court seised.\n\n43.\n\nCDC submits that the Court should reply to the effect that it ought to be possible, pursuant to that provision, for the overall damage suffered as a result of the cartel constituting the infringement to be pleaded before the courts of all the Member States in whose territory at least a part of that cartel agreement was concluded or given effect, or the market concerned was at least partially obstructed, directly and significantly, by that agreement. The Commission adopts a similar approach, but is more guarded concerning the extent of the jurisdiction of the courts that could validly be seised in this respect. ( [36](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0036) ) Those defendants in the main proceedings that have expressed a view on the second question submit either that the question is inadmissible ( [37](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0037) ) or, on the merits, that the court should not have overall jurisdiction with respect to all members of the unlawful cartel and for all the damages claimed. ( [38](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0038) )\n\n44.\n\nI would point out that, in the light of the Court’s case-law relating to Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, there are several guiding principles that govern the interpretation of that provision. First, it is settled case-law that the concepts appearing in it are to be interpreted independently, without reference, therefore, to national legal concepts, regard being had primarily to the general scheme and objectives of the regulation, in order to ensure the uniform application of the latter in all the Member States. ( [39](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0039) ) Next, this provision being a special rule, in that it derogates from the principle of attributing jurisdiction to the courts of the defendant’s domicile as laid down in Article 2 of that regulation, it must be interpreted restrictively, not broadly, ( [40](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0040) ) in order in particular to prevent the jurisdiction of the forum actoris becoming generalised ( [41](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0041) ) and to prevent the growth in the number of courts with jurisdiction encouraging ‘forum shopping’.\n\n45.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to bear in mind that the Court has held, in accordance with the objective of linkage mentioned in recital 12 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation, that the rule governing jurisdiction in Article 5(3) is based on the existence of a particularly close connecting factor between the dispute and the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred. It is that connecting factor that justifies the exceptional attribution of jurisdiction to those courts for reasons relating to the sound administration of justice and the efficacious conduct of proceedings. ( [42](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0042) ) Given that identification of one of the connecting factors recognised by the case-law cited ( [43](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0043) ) must make it possible to establish the jurisdiction of the court objectively best placed to determine whether the elements that constitute the liability of the person sued do in fact exist, it follows that only the court within whose jurisdiction the relevant connecting factor is situated may validly be seised. ( [44](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0044) )\n\n46.\n\nIt is precisely that connection that could be wanting, in the view of the referring court, if in this case it were to be held that, under Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, any court situated in any one of the many places in which the cartel agreement was conceived, arranged and monitored and in which purchasers’ freedom of choice was limited on the relevant market could have jurisdiction in respect of all the defendants sued and all the alleged damage. ( [45](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0045) ) I share its point of view for the following reasons.\n\n2. Giving effect to the criteria governing the application of Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation in a case such as that in the main proceedings\n\n47.\n\nAlthough application of Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation in the context of an action for damages relating to an infringement of Article 101 TFEU cannot be excluded in principle, ( [46](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0046) ) I am none the less inclined to the view that that provision cannot properly be applied in the particular case of a horizontal cartel, which has existed for a long time and has restricted competition throughout Union territory and whose structure is highly complex, since it has given rise to a series of agreements and collusive practices, with the result that both the participants in the cartel and the persons sustaining the alleged damage are scattered over a great many Member States. ( [47](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0047) )\n\n48.\n\nIn circumstances such as those obtaining in this case, the criteria laid down in the case-law for determining ‘the place where the harmful event occurred’, within the meaning of that provision, are in my view ineffective, due to the considerable geographical dispersal of the causes and effects of the harm invoked. The two aspects of the alternative identified by the Court lead, in this case, to jurisdiction potentially being conferred on a multitude of courts in the Member States, whereas the regulation seeks to limit the number of concurrent proceedings, ( [48](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0048) ) and do not enable the identification of a court that has a ‘particularly close link’ with the dispute and is therefore the ‘best placed’ratione loci to decide the case, whereas that is the basis of Article 5(3).\n\n49.\n\nAs regards the criterion relating to the place of the event giving rise to the alleged damage, this could theoretically refer to any place in which the unlawful cartel agreement was entered into by its members, a place which it could be difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint in view of the secret nature of the cartel, unless the various places where the registered offices of the companies concerned are situated are taken into account. That criterion could also relate to all the places where the unlawful agreement was actually put into effect, in other words, every one of the places where the participants actually organised and applied the rules of their collusive agreements aimed at restricting competition, through active anti-competitive practices or inaction. ( [49](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0049) ) In this connection, I consider, unlike the Commission, that Melzer, ( [50](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0050) ) which excluded the possibility of basing jurisdiction on the place where the harmful event was committed by a co-perpetrator who had not been sued, should lead to the impossibility of attributing the activities of a member of a cartel in the territory of a Member State to other perpetrators of the infringement who refrained from competing freely on the corresponding market in that territory. ( [51](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0051) ) At all events, in the context of a cartel of long duration at European level, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, these locating factors seem to me to be irrelevant in that they lead to over-generous, too diffuse and fortuitous grounds of jurisdiction, ( [52](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0052) ) given the large numbers of parties involved and of actions or omissions concerned and, hence, the multiplicity of places where the corresponding harmful facts occurred. ( [53](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0053) )\n\n50.\n\nWith regard to the criterion relating to the place where the alleged damage occurred, it may be considered, from an economic point of view, that the damage occurred either in every one of the places where the persons allegedly adversely affected bought the products covered by the cartel agreement, in other words, the places of signature and/or performance of the contracts whose content was limited by the cartel — in this case the supply contracts between the defendants and the undertakings which transferred their rights to the applicant — or in every one of the places where those persons affected or their branches have their registered office. The persons indirectly injured, who were not contractually bound to a member of the cartel but who were nevertheless harmed by the existence of the latter, ( [54](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0054) ) ought also to be able to invoke the harm caused to them, within the limits laid down by the case-law of this Court. ( [55](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0055) ) It should, however, be recalled that the choice of jurisdiction available in the case of tort or delict is not to be interpreted in such a way as to allow a forum actoris, because the Brussels I Regulation tends to restrict the latter factor of jurisdiction in order to preserve the effectiveness of the general rule in Article 2. ( [56](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0056) ) Moreover, account could to advantage be taken of all the places where the market has been affected by the infringement of Article 101 TFEU, given that the purpose of the rules of competition law is to safeguard the proper functioning of economic activity, and not to protect the individual interests of a particular company. ( [57](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0057) ) In this case, the infringement on which the action for damages is based affects the territories of all the Member States of the Union, which means that a large number of courts could possibly have jurisdiction. ( [58](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0058) ) Such a broad approach conflicts with the objectives of the Brussels I Regulation, mentioned above, and particularly with those in Article 5(3) thereof. I would also add that the case-law in Shevill and Others ( [59](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0059) ) implies a point which it is, in my view, neither feasible nor desirable to alter, namely, that jurisdiction based on the place where the harmful event occurred is divided territorially, according to the borders of the Member States, ( [60](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0060) ) with the associated risk of an explosion of litigation because the court having jurisdiction by virtue of that criterion cannot cover all the multiple instances of damage pleaded.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, I would stress that, if the Court were to hold that a multiplicity of courts had jurisdiction in this case under Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, the possibilities offered to citizens seeking legal redress on that basis would be very significantly opened up, whereas this is a choice of jurisdiction of a special nature, and must, therefore, in principle be interpreted strictly. In addition, there would then be a — far from hypothetical ( [61](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0061) ) — danger that the perpetrators of an infringement of EU competition law would be enabled to bring ‘torpedo actions’, in the form of actions for a negative declaration, in accordance with Folien Fischer and Fofitec, ( [62](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0062) ) in a Member State in which proceedings were known to be particularly drawn out, against persons who had been identified as injured parties in the administrative proceedings before the Commission. By contrast, once a Commission decision concerning the existence of an infringement has been given, it ought, in my opinion, no longer to be possible for an action for a negative declaration to be brought, by reason of the binding effect of the Commission decision as to the facts and their legal classification. ( [63](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0063) )\n\n52.\n\nIn conclusion, by analogy with the Court’s ruling in Besix, ( [64](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0064) ) I consider that the special jurisdiction rule in matters of tort, delict or quasi-delict, laid down in Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, is inoperative when, as in the case in the main proceedings, the place where the harmful event allegedly occurred cannot be determined, by virtue of the fact that the infringement of Article 101 TFEU on which the action is based consists of actions notable for the multiplicity of places where they were agreed and/or performed, with the result that it is not possible to determine clearly and usefully what court has a particularly close link with the dispute as a whole.\n\n53.\n\nIn my opinion, in such a case jurisdiction must be determined either by applying the general rule in Article 2(1) of the Brussels I Regulation or by applying other special jurisdiction rules specified in that regulation, such as the rule in Article 6(1), which allows actions brought against several defendants to be combined before a single court, provided that the conditions for applying one or other of those rules are satisfied in the case in point. In that connection, it must be pointed out that it is possible for account to be taken of the connection between actions against several defendants, as a basis for establishing jurisdiction, only in the context of Article 6(1), ( [65](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0065) ) which provides for that possibility solely where there is the strong connecting link of the domicile of one of the defendants, but not in the context of a provision such as Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation whose application depends on the place where an event occurred.\n\nC – Interpretation of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation (first question)\n\n54.\n\nBy its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as provided for in Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, can apply in the case of an action against undertakings which have participated differently, in terms of place and time, in a single continuous infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in EU law (1). It then asks the Court to rule whether, in the case of an affirmative reply, the withdrawal of such an action with respect to the ‘anchor defendant’, in other words, the only one of the co-defendants to be domiciled in the Member State of the court seised, impinges on the jurisdiction of the latter under that provision (2).\n\n1. The applicability of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in a case such as that in the main proceedings [question 1(a)]\n\na) The problem raised before the Court\n\n55.\n\nIt must be emphasised that, as with Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, ( [66](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0066) ) the tenor of Article 6(1) of that regulation must be determined independently, so that the concepts appearing in it may not be interpreted as making a reference to the classification that the domestic law applicable gives to the legal relationship at issue before the court seised. ( [67](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0067) )\n\n56.\n\nIn accordance with Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, all the claims on the part of a single applicant against a number of defendants may be brought before a court of a Member State in whose jurisdiction at least one of those defendants, who will be referred to here as the ‘anchor defendant’, is domiciled, ( [68](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0068) ) provided always that there is a connecting link between those heads of claim. ( [69](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0069) ) In this regard, the relevant provision expressly states that the claims must be ‘so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings’. ( [70](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0070) )\n\n57.\n\nBy allowing actions to be centralised before a single court and by extending the jurisdiction of the latter to cover defendants vis-à-vis whom the court would not have been able to give a ruling failing that extension, Article 6(1) reflects the objectives of sound administration of justice, by eliminating unnecessary proceedings and preventing the concomitant risk of concurrent proceedings and conflicting decisions, as referred to in the Brussels I Regulation. ( [71](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0071) )\n\n58.\n\nHowever, because that rule of jurisdiction is of a special nature, in that it derogates from the principle of the court for the domicile of each defendant mentioned in recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation and set out in Article 2 thereof, it is settled case-law that it is to be interpreted strictly. ( [72](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0072) )\n\n59.\n\nBecause the application of Article 6(1) must thus remain exceptional, the joining of cases for which it provides is permitted only if those cases do not refer to a single insured person, consumer or worker ( [73](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0073) ) and only if they relate solely to claims that, while distinct, are none the less closely connected.\n\n60.\n\nIt is to this latter condition that the first part of the first question in essence relates. It invites the Court to declare whether this connecting factor is to be found in the context of an action such as that before the referring court, namely, an action for disclosure and damages brought jointly and severally against the co-perpetrators of a cartel agreement declared to be in breach of EU law which participated in that cartel in different places and at different times.\n\n61.\n\nThose interested parties that have lodged written observations on this matter have differing views, for CDC and the Commission consider that Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is applicable in this context, whereas the defendants in the main proceedings maintain the contrary. ( [74](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0074) )\n\n62.\n\nIt follows from the Court’s case-law concerning the connecting factor required by that provision that, in order for decisions to be regarded as ‘irreconcilable’, it is not sufficient that there be a divergence in the outcome of the dispute; it is necessary too that that divergence arise in the context of the same situation of fact and law. ( [75](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0075) ) The attempt to establish these two criteria in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings has led to contrasting observations being submitted to the Court.\n\nb) Existence of the same factual situation\n\n63.\n\nIn the view of the defendants in the main proceedings, the claims relied upon in the application in those proceedings do not satisfy the criterion of a situation that is identical de facto, on the grounds that it is irrelevant whether the members of the unlawful cartel all participated in the agreements setting up the cartel, because only the implementation of those agreements could actually have caused damage to the purchasers which transferred their rights to CDC, and that it is necessary for every claim made by the applicant on that basis to be examined separately.\n\n64.\n\nIn this connection, I am of the opposite view, put forward by the referring court, CDC and the Commission, to the effect that claims such as those made against the various defendants in the main proceedings relate to a single situation of fact, even though the defendants participated in different ways, in different places and at different times, according to the referring court, in the performance of the agreement in question and in the conclusion and performance of the various contracts distorted by that agreement that allegedly harmed the undertakings having transferred their rights to the applicant in the main proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nAs the referring court points out, the Commission decision on which the claims are based found, in terms binding on the courts of the Member States, ( [76](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0076) ) that a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 EC (Article 101 TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement had been committed by the companies sued by CDC and that the conduct in which the other co-participants had engaged could be attributed to every participant as a co-offender, irrespective of its own individual contribution. ( [77](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0077) ) It adds, quite correctly in my view, that the conduct established in the administrative fine proceedings renders every author of the infringement liable for damages, in civil law, for the tortious conduct of the co-authors and, therefore, for any loss or harm liable to result from that conduct.\n\nc) Existence of the same situation in law\n\n66.\n\nThe Court has already ruled, in the light of the wording of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, that a difference in the legal bases of actions brought against different defendants is not in itself an obstacle to the application of that provision, always provided, however, that the defendants could foresee that they risked being sued in the Member State where at least one of them had its domicile. ( [78](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0078) )\n\n67.\n\nIn this case, the participants in a cartel agreement, established in a single Commission decision and constituting a single infringement of EU competition law, not committed at the level of various domestic legal orders, find themselves in the same legal situation, in other words, they are confronted with an obligation to pay compensation under EU law derived from the Court’s consistent case-law. Thus, they could reasonably expect subsequently to be sued together for compensation before the court for the place where one of them was domiciled. In such circumstances, the principle of the predictability of jurisdiction, laid down by the Court in accordance with the objective expressed in recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation, has therefore been observed.\n\n68.\n\nMoreover, it is worth emphasising that in Kalfelis, which introduced the requirement of a connecting link between actions which could be joined under that provision, the Court referred to the Jenard Report, according to which ‘[i]n order for this rule [laid down in Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention] to be applicable, there must be a connection between the claims made against each of the defendants, as for example in the case of joint debtors’. ( [79](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0079) ) This is precisely the situation in the dispute in the main proceedings according to the referring court, despite the fact that that classification as jointly liable perpetrators is disputed by some of the defendants.\n\n69.\n\nI consider that the mere possibility of joint liability in the case of multiple perpetrators being invoked in one of the relevant Member States, and not in others, is sufficient to create a risk of different and mutually irreconcilable judgments, within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation. In the legal order of that Member State, the liability of each of the defendants could theoretically be extended to include all the damage caused, whereas in the legal systems of the Member States where joint liability would not be countenanced, the level of the damages awarded would be likely to vary considerably, depending on the courts seised. Even in the contrary hypothesis, if that joint liability were accepted in all the relevant Member States, the risk of irreconcilable judgments being given if the claims were judged separately would still exist as regards the apportionment of liability between the members of the cartel, depending on whether they were involved for all or only some of the period concerned.\n\n70.\n\nIn this connection, it may be noted that, in the light of the indications given by the Commission in its observations, the joint and several liability of the participants for a common infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article 101 TFEU appears to be a principle generally accepted in the legal systems of the Member States ( [80](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0080) ) and that it has been upheld in, inter alia, the relevant directive, which has recently been adopted. ( [81](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0081) )\n\n71.\n\nI would emphasise that, if it were to be held that Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation was not applicable to proceedings such as the main proceedings in this case, that would mean that different courts would have to examine the alleged damage, without any consultation, in the light of the various domestic legal orders, ( [82](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0082) ) with the attendant risk that each of the participants in the same unlawful cartel might be ordered to pay different amounts of damages, when it would be desirable, not to say necessary, to rule uniformly on the claims submitted by the same applicant. ( [83](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0083) )\n\n72.\n\nAs the Commission points out, in my view rightly, ‘the effectiveness of this provision would be undermined if it were to be interpreted so strictly that it would render impossible, in such circumstances, the bringing of joint actions against all the participants in a cartel before a court which is situated in the domicile of one of the defendants belonging to the cartel, on the sole grounds that it lacked international jurisdiction’.\n\n73.\n\nIn the light of these factors, I consider that a situation in which several companies established in different Member States are tried separately, before different courts, and not before a single court, for the purpose of obtaining damages in respect of the same infringement of EU competition law, resulting from acts committed at different times and in different places but constituting a single and continuous infringement, is liable to lead to irreconcilable judgments, within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, if the cases are judged separately.\n\n74.\n\nIn accordance with the Court’s case-law, it will be for the referring court to assess, in the light of all the elements in the case, whether there exists such a risk in the proceedings before it. ( [84](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0084) )\n\n75.\n\nLike the Commission, I note that such an interpretation has the not inconsiderable advantage of reflecting the intention expressed by the legislature in the Rome II Regulation, especially in Article 6 entitled ‘Unfair competition and acts restricting free competition’, paragraph 3 of which sets out the possibility, for a claimant suing several defendants in the context of a dispute in this field, of centralising his claims before a single court ‘in accordance with the applicable rules on jurisdiction’ and of basing his claims on the law of that court. ( [85](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0085) ) To my mind, due account should be taken of this legal guideline, in the interests of coherence between the instruments of Union law applicable to cross-border disputes, ( [86](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0086) ) despite the fact that, as the defendants in the main proceedings contend, the Rome II Regulation is not, ratione temporis, applicable in this case. ( [87](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0087) )\n\n2. The effect, for the purposes of applying Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, of withdrawal of the action against the sole co-defendant established in the State of the court seised [part (b) of the first question]\n\n76.\n\nIn the second part of its first question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court identifies two problems of interpretation concerning Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of withdrawal of the action against the ‘anchor co-defendant’, namely, (a) the possible application of the principle perpetuatio fori ( [88](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0088) ) on the basis of that provision in such a situation, on the one hand, and (b) the inferences to be drawn from a possible abuse of the right to rely on a connecting link on that basis, on the other hand.\n\n77.\n\nThe answers suggested by the interested parties having lodged observations on these two problems differ most markedly, but it may be noted briefly that the defendants in the main proceedings maintain that the extension of jurisdiction provided for in Article 6(1) ought not to continue in such circumstances, ( [89](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0089) ) contrary to the view taken by CDC and the Commission, albeit with several nuances in the case of the latter.\n\na) Maintenance of jurisdiction based on Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of withdrawal of the action against the anchor defendant\n\n78.\n\nI share the opinion of the referring court, CDC and the Commission that, provided that a connecting link between the claims made against several defendants had been established at the time the action was brought, subsequent withdrawal of the action against the defendant justifying the extended jurisdiction of the court seised, under Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, is not to have the effect of terminating that jurisdiction.\n\n79.\n\nThe Court has, it is true, not yet had occasion to give a direct ruling on this problem. However, it should be noted that, in the judgment in Reisch Montage, the Court stressed that Article 6(1) makes no reference to the application of domestic rules, which may not therefore stand in the way of the application of that provision, and held that the provision in question must apply ‘even when that action is regarded under a national provision as inadmissible, from the time it is brought, against the … defendant [domiciled in the Member State of the court seised]’. ( [90](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0090) ) Furthermore, in its judgment in Freeport, the Court expressly identified the bringing of the action as the reference point for determining whether claims are connected. ( [91](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0091) )\n\n80.\n\nThe criterion that appears to me to be decisive, if the effectiveness of the derived jurisdiction under Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is to remain valid, is that the claim against the ‘anchor defendant’ should be withdrawn only after the court concerned has been seised in accordance with the requisite procedural conditions. ( [92](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0092) ) Given that the bringing of proceedings was effective by that date it is, however, of no consequence, in my view, whether the withdrawal took place, as in this case, before the expiry of the period fixed by the court for a defence to be lodged and the start of the first hearing.\n\n81.\n\nIt is to be recalled in this connection that Article 30 of the Brussels I Regulation defines the time by which a court of a Member State is deemed to be seised, for the purpose of applying the provisions of Article 9 regarding lis pendens and related actions. ( [93](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0093) ) In my view, that definition may also be taken into account with regard to the other sections of Chapter II relating to competition rules, and indeed must be, in relation to Article 6(1), because the latter establishes a rule also based on connexity between claims. ( [94](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0094) )\n\n82.\n\nIn addition, maintaining the grouping together of connected claims before the court seised, made possible by Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, is consistent with the objectives of sound administration of justice, predictability and legal certainty which underpin the jurisdiction rules in this regulation, ( [95](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0095) ) because that maintenance makes it possible to prevent irreconcilable judgments being given, at least vis-à-vis the remaining defendants, which already knew, moreover, that they were all being sued before that court at the time of the withdrawal in question.\n\n83.\n\nI consider, therefore, that the fact that the applicant withdrew its action against the only co-defendant domiciled in the jurisdiction of the court seised does not in itself affect jurisdiction on the basis of Article 6(1), when that withdrawal is made after the date on which the court was validly seised, provided that a further condition, which I shall go on to examine, is also satisfied.\n\nb) Limit resulting from an abuse of the right to base jurisdiction on Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n84.\n\nIn accordance with the Court’s consistent case-law, ‘the rule [on jurisdiction laid down in Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation] cannot be interpreted in such a way as to allow a plaintiff to make a claim against a number of defendants for the sole purpose of removing one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled’. ( [96](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0096) ) This restriction concerning a potential ousting of jurisdiction of the court seised, which was supported in the Jenard Report ( [97](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0097) ) is perfectly consistent with the requirement that derogations from the jurisdiction in principle of the courts for the place of a defendant’s domicile, laid down in Article 2 of the Brussels I Regulation, should be interpreted restrictively.\n\n85.\n\nIn Freeport, the Court indicated that ‘where claims brought against different defendants are connected when the proceedings are instituted’, the rule on jurisdiction laid down in Article 6(1) is applicable ‘without there being any further need to establish separately that the claims were not brought with the sole object of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where one of the defendants is domiciled’. ( [98](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0098) ) The issue of the consequences to be drawn from that somewhat ambiguous wording creates a problem for the referring court and divides both the parties to this case and also the legal writers who have commented on that judgment. ( [99](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0099) )\n\n86.\n\nIn this connection, the analysis of the referring court appears to be correct, in that it considers that, when the condition relating to the existence of a connecting factor between claims is satisfied, for the purposes of that provision, the court seised is not obliged to examine systematically whether the extended jurisdiction deriving from the latter provision resulted from an abuse of rights, although it may nevertheless do so if there is sufficient evidence that the applicant availing itself of the extended jurisdiction has so conducted itself as to distort the true purpose of that rule of jurisdiction .\n\n87.\n\nIn this case, the referring court points to probable collusion between the applicant in the main proceedings and Evonik Degussa, the defendant in the main proceedings domiciled in Germany, which, it appears, deliberately delayed the formal conclusion of their out-of-court settlement until after proceedings had been instituted, although an agreement would have been envisaged, if not decided upon, well before, for the sole purpose of establishing extended jurisdiction in that Member State. ( [100](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0100) )\n\n88.\n\nProvided that the deceitful tactics alleged, disputed in this case by the parties concerned, are not just probable but confirmed, which it will be for the national court to establish, such an abuse of rights, which is designed to deprive one or more of the defendants of the general jurisdiction as a rule of the court for the place where they are domiciled, ( [101](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0101) ) ought in my view to be penalised by refusal to apply Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in those circumstances, given that the criteria relating to connecting factors were not truly satisfied at the time the action was brought. ( [102](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0102) ) The advantage of its being the court for the domicile of the ‘anchor defendant’ that examines and tries the claims against several defendants at the same time, in accordance with that provision, disappeared as soon as a binding transaction put an end, vis-à-vis that defendant, to the legal obligation that the applicant could have relied upon against it before that court. Apart from these specific cases, there is, on the other hand, no need in my view to examine and penalise an abuse of rights in a legal context of this nature.\n\n89.\n\nI would point out that the existence of a connecting factor required under Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation provides an option for the applicant, to whom, in my opinion and in accordance with the Opinions of Advocates General Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer and Mengozzi on the subject of ‘forum shopping’, it is open to exercise that option in the manner he considers most suitable and advantageous, and this need not necessarily amount to depriving the proper court of its jurisdiction. ( [103](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0103) ) Furthermore, in the case of unlawful agreements such as that in the main proceedings, the application of that provision could, by definition, given its object, lead to one or more defendants having to answer for their conduct before a court other than that of their domicile, and in consequence an objection based on that actual outcome would be irrelevant.\n\n90.\n\nIn the light of all those matters, I consider that the rule on extended jurisdiction in Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is not to apply when it has been properly established, according to the court seised, that the applicant had entered into a legally binding transaction with the defendant domiciled in the Member State of the court seised before bringing its action and that it had knowingly concealed the existence of that earlier agreement, for the sole purpose of depriving one of the other defendants of the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that other defendant is domiciled.\n\nD – Possible application of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in a dispute such as that forming the subject-matter of the main proceedings (third question)\n\n91.\n\nThe third question, the reasoning of which is, alas, somewhat laconic, asks the Court to rule whether, having regard to the principle laid down by the Court of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article 101 TFEU and guaranteed by the right of persons injured to claim damages for harm suffered in that connection, ( [104](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0104) ) it would be permissible, in this case, to derogate from the rules on jurisdiction in Articles 5(3) and/or 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation as a result of the action of arbitration and/or jurisdiction clauses (1).\n\n92.\n\nGiven that the latter type of clause falls within the scope of Article 23 of that regulation, unlike arbitration clauses, it is necessary to consider the impact of that provision in this context (2). Moreover, even if the referring court starts a priori from the premise that the two categories of clause invoked by the defendants in the main proceedings can be applicable in the context of an action for damages, as in the main proceedings, ( [105](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0105) ) which is, in my view, debatable (4), it will in any case be necessary to examine whether, and if so to what extent, such clauses can produce their effects when the content of the contracts in which they appear has been compromised by the unlawful agreement in question (3).\n\n1. The problem put before the Court\n\n93.\n\nFor the purpose of disputing the jurisdiction of the Landgericht Dortmund, the defendants in the main action have objected that there were arbitration and jurisdiction clauses in some of the supply contracts entered into between the hydrogen peroxide buyers having transferred their rights to CDC and the suppliers having taken part in the unlawful agreement on which CDC’s claims for damages are based.\n\n94.\n\nThe decision for reference does not contain a detailed description of the clauses in question. However, it is apparent from the observations of CDC that, according to the contentions of the defendants in the main action, some of those supply contracts did contain such clauses, either in the form of general conditions relating to a specific contract, ( [106](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0106) ) or in framework contracts covering several deliveries to a customer over a period other than the period of the cartel, ( [107](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0107) ) it being indicated that certain customers had concluded several clauses with different suppliers ( [108](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0108) ) or different clauses in the various contracts with the same suppliers. ( [109](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0109) ) The question whether the jurisdiction clauses invoked designated courts of the Member States only, or courts of third States too, is not clearly established.\n\n95.\n\nAs set out in the grounds for the third question put forward by the referring court, the latter considers that if the clauses did cover the claims for damages at issue, which it is for that court alone to determine, ( [110](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0110) ) the question would then arise whether the principle of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices under EU law precludes the application of such clauses when the court hearing an action of this kind has jurisdiction by virtue of Articles 6(1) and/or 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n96.\n\nOf the interested parties having submitted observations to the Court, only CDC claims that those clauses ought not to be taken into account in such a context. The Commission stresses that, in order to resolve the preliminary question whether an arbitration or jurisdiction clause actually covers rights to compensation such as those at issue, the national court will need to consider the fact that those rights do not arise from the supply contracts in question but from the infringement constituted by the cartel agreement, which is not germane to those contracts.\n\n97.\n\nBefore expressing my opinion on this issue, I should wish to offer clarification of a few points that are, to my way of thinking, important. In the first place, it must be recalled that choice of jurisdiction clauses, under which the parties, at least one of which had its domicile in the territory of a Member State, have designated a court of a Member State to hear and determine disputes arising or likely to arise out of a particular legal relationship, fall within the ambit of Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n98.\n\nOn the other hand, arbitration clauses are, as a matter of principle, excluded from the scope of that regulation. ( [111](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0111) ) It follows that questions relating to the validity of, and the possibility of relying on, those clauses ought to be governed by the national law of each of the Member States and by the international conventions binding the latter. ( [112](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0112) ) Nevertheless, the Court has held that if, because of the main subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, the nature of the rights to be protected in proceedings, such as a claim for damages, the proceedings brought before a national court fall within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation, then an incidental preliminary issue concerning the applicability of an arbitration agreement, including its validity, falls within the scope of that regulation too and it is, therefore, exclusively for that court to rule on the objection of lack of jurisdiction based on the existence of an arbitration agreement and on its own jurisdiction under the provisions of that regulation. ( [113](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0113) )\n\n99.\n\nDespite this difference in terms of the applicability of the Brussels I Regulation, it must be recalled that the two categories of clause at issue have the common effect of derogating from the rules on jurisdiction laid down in that regulation, by reason of respect for the autonomy of the parties concerning the determination of the court, whether national or arbitral as the case may be, to which they mean to entrust the task of settling their disputes. ( [114](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0114) )\n\n100.\n\nNevertheless, a clause conferring jurisdiction in accordance with Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation may confer jurisdiction only on the courts of Member States of the European Union and by extension, under the Lugano Convention, ( [115](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0115) ) on the courts of the Parties to that Convention, whereas an arbitration clause may provide that arbitration is to take place in any third State whatsoever. The likelihood of provisions of EU competition law not being applied, even by way of public policy rules, is much greater when jurisdiction is conferred on arbitrators or courts of States not bound by the Lugano Convention. ( [116](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0116) )\n\n101.\n\nIn the second place, I would emphasise that the interplay between jurisdiction and arbitration clauses, on the one hand, and provisions of EU competition law, on the other, is complex because the legal context of barriers to the free competition affirmed in those provisions offers a wide variety of possible configurations. More specifically, regarding the right to full compensation based on Article 101 TFEU, I recall that it is not always easy to classify the liability of the author of an infringement of that provision as being of a contractual or tortious nature and that there are differences in this regard between the legal systems of the Member States. ( [117](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0117) )\n\n102.\n\nThe existence of various contractual links between the members of the cartel and the persons injured by such an infringement raises the problem of ascertaining whether the clauses concerned can permit derogation, in the present case, from the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State which is based on Articles 5 or 6 of the Brussels I Regulation, despite the fact that the content of the contracts containing those clauses is affected by the infringement at issue.\n\n103.\n\nGiven that it is for the national court to determine the substantive scope of such clauses, ( [118](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0118) ) the third question asks the Court, in essence, to determine whether, and if so how, the principles inherent in Article 101 TFEU could influence, first, the application of Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of the jurisdiction clauses covered by the latter and, next, the implementation of other types of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses governed by rules belonging to the law of the Member States.\n\n2. Ousting of the rules on jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of the Brussels I Regulation by jurisdiction clauses consistent with Article 23 of that regulation\n\n104.\n\nIt is, first of all, to be noted that compensation for damage caused by an unlawful agreement, such as that sought by the applicant in the main proceedings, is governed in general terms by the independent decisions of the parties, in that it is a civil-law obligation incumbent on any person having committed an unlawful act that he should make financial reparation for the harm caused to another person, a field in which the substantive rights of the parties concerned are not unavailable. ( [119](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0119) ) Likewise, the Brussels I Regulation does not prevent parties from conferring jurisdiction ratione loci ( [120](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0120) ) on a court of a Member State in the context of a dispute relating to such a matter in accordance with Article 23 of that regulation.\n\n105.\n\nAs regards the interplay between the provisions of the latter article and those of Articles 5(3) and/or 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, Kemira correctly states that the Court has previously held that, by concluding an agreement on the choice of court under Article 17 of the Brussels Convention, the parties might derogate, not only from the general jurisdiction under Article 2 thereof, but also from the special jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and 6. ( [121](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0121) ) The Court has held, on the one hand, that ‘this interpretation is justified on the ground that Article 17 is based on a recognition of the independent will of the parties to a contract in deciding which courts are to have jurisdiction to settle disputes falling within the scope of the Convention, other than those which are expressly excluded pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 17’ and, on the other hand, that ‘such an agreement … is nevertheless effective in that it excludes, in relations between the parties, other optional attributions of jurisdiction, such as those detailed in Articles 5 and 6 of the [Brussels] Convention’. ( [122](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0122) )\n\n106.\n\nThe same applies to the equivalent provisions of the Brussels I Regulation, given that, according to recitals 11 and 14 in the preamble and Article 23(5), ‘the autonomy of the parties to a contract … to determine the courts having jurisdiction … must be respected’, except where either special jurisdiction rules designed to protect the weaker party ( [123](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0123) ) or the special jurisdiction rules in Article 22 are applicable. Apart from provisions whose application is expressly reserved in this way, which do not include Articles 5 and 6 of that regulation, an agreement conferring jurisdiction pursuant to Article 23 must be fully effective and must, in particular, confer exclusive jurisdiction on the court chosen.\n\n107.\n\nThat prevailing of the will of the parties applies, in particular, in relation to the objectives of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation concerning centralisation of jurisdiction and procedural efficiency and, in my view, even though that clause does not expressly state that the parties intended to derogate from that specific provision.\n\n108.\n\nRegarding Article 5(3) of that regulation, it must be determined, beforehand, whether a clause conferring jurisdiction can really apply in a dispute such as that forming the subject of the main proceedings, which appears to me to relate to matters of tort rather than of contract, ( [124](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0124) ) and whether it may be relied upon against an applicant such as CDC, as a result of a substitution in the obligations entered into by the undertakings having transferred their rights to CDC, ( [125](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0125) ) which it will be for the referring court to ascertain following the relevant guidelines provided by the Court.\n\n109.\n#addthis #important \nI would, in particular, recall that it follows from the Court’s case-law in relation to Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation, on the one hand, that the validity of a jurisdiction clause inserted in a contract is dependent on the parties that concluded it having clearly indicated their agreement to that clause and, on the other hand, that the court seised is required to examine whether that clause was the subject of consensus between the parties. ( [126](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0126) )\n\n110.\n\nFurthermore, according to that article, an agreement as to the choice of court can apply only to disputes that have arisen or are likely to arise ‘in connection with a particular legal relationship’. Having interpreted that criterion in relation to Article 17 of the Brussels Convention, the Court held that ‘[t]hat requirement is intended to limit the scope of an agreement conferring jurisdiction solely to disputes which arise from the legal relationship in connection with which the agreement was entered into. Its purpose is to avoid a party being taken by surprise by the assignment of jurisdiction to a given forum as regards all disputes which may arise out of its relationship with the other party to the contract and stem from a relationship other than that in connection with which the agreement conferring jurisdiction was made’. ( [127](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0127) )\n\n111.\n\nLike CDC, I very much doubt that a clause conferring jurisdiction, included in contracts such as those at issue, could satisfy the requirement of clear unvitiated consensus, because the point is the attribution of jurisdiction to the court designated to settle a case relating to the tortious liability of one of the contracting parties deriving from an unlawful cartel when, at the time it concluded the agreement, the person allegedly injured was unaware of the existence of the cartel.\n\n112.\n\nOn the other hand, it could, to my mind, be accepted that the person injured should enter into an agreement conferring jurisdiction after it had learned of the existence of the unlawful cartel agreement prohibited by Article 101 TFEU, the former agreement being entered into after the dispute arose, and hence accepted in full knowledge of the facts.\n\n113.\n\nIn this connection, I would stress that Directive 2014/104, mentioned above, which relates to actions for damages under national law for infringements of EU competition law, is intended in particular to promote recourse to consensual dispute resolution mechanisms, such as out-of-court settlements and arbitration, and to increase their effectiveness. ( [128](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0128) ) This approach appears to me well-founded, in that the parties have fully and freely consented to attribute the matter of claims for damages arising from an unlawful cartel agreement to a particular court, even if that is not the court that would have jurisdiction under Articles 5(3) and 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n114.\n\nWhatever the analysis that the referring court will make of those latter points, I consider that there are no grounds for the principle, mentioned in the third preliminary question, of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article 101 TFEU, to interfere in the particular case of jurisdiction clauses covered by Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n115.\n\nWith regard to such a clause, it is not national rules but the provisions of that article that determine, in EU law, the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States in civil and commercial matters, by laying down the conditions governing the validity and legal effects of that clause. ( [129](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0129) ) The foregoing considerations concerning the judicial interpretation of Article 23 ( [130](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0130) ) clearly lead to clauses compatible with the requirements of that article particularly as regards the consent of the person allegedly harmed by the unlawful cartel agreement, taking precedence over the bases of jurisdiction resulting from Articles 5 and/or 6 of the regulation.\n\n116.\n\nI would add that mutual trust between the courts of the Member States, which is one of the pillars of the system of judicial cooperation established by the Brussels Convention and taken up in the Brussels I Regulation, ( [131](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0131) ) implies, in my view, that the jurisdiction of the court chosen by the parties in accordance with Article 23 of that regulation is not to be frustrated on the basis of Article 101 TFEU, in the same way as the Court has held that considerations of public policy may not be relied upon in order to contest the enforcement of a judgment given in another Member State on the grounds that EU competition law was incorrectly applied therein to the substance of the case. ( [132](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0132) )\n\n117.\n\nConsequently, I consider that, given a clause designating a court of another Member State, which has been recognised to be compatible with Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation and is duly applicable to the dispute of which that court is seised, a court of a Member State ought to decline its own jurisdiction, even where that clause entails disregarding the special rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles 5 and/or 6 of that regulation, and this notwithstanding the principle of the effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article 101 TFEU.\n\n3. The effect, vis-à-vis the other types of clause invoked, of the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article 101 TFEU\n\n118.\n\nWith regard to the clauses conferring jurisdiction to which Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation proves not to be applicable and to arbitration clauses, the problem raised by the referring court is more complex, for it must be tackled by applying, not the provisions of that regulation, as interpreted by the Court, but rules of national law, whose implementation must be consistent with the binding provisions of EU primary law, and in particular with Article 101 TFEU.\n\n119.\n\nIn this connection, I would recall that, according to its consistent case-law in the judgments in Courage and Crehan and Manfredi and Others, ( [133](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0133) ) the Court has held that, failing EU legislation in that sphere, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to prescribe the detailed rules for exercising the right to compensation for damage resulting from an agreement, decision or concerted practice prohibited under Article 101 TFEU, ( [134](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0134) ) subject to observance of the principles of equivalence and effectiveness which require, in particular, that those national rules should not hinder the full effectiveness of Union competition law and should take account, more specifically, of the objective contained in that article. ( [135](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0135) ) In my opinion, it therefore follows in this case that the application of national rules may not allow the jurisdiction and/or arbitration clauses at issue to prejudice that full effectiveness.\n\n120.\n\nFurthermore, the Court has held that the full effect of Article 101 TFEU and, in particular, the effectiveness of paragraph 1 thereof ( [136](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0136) ) would be put at risk if it were not open to any individual to claim damages for loss caused to him by a contract or conduct liable to restrict or distort competition, such as the unlawful cartel agreement which, in this case, forms the basis for CDC’s claims. The guarantee that individuals may seek such compensation is likely to discourage agreements or practices of this nature, which are often concealed, and it therefore contributes significantly towards maintaining effective competition within the Union. ( [137](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0137) )\n\n121.\n\nAs a general rule, when faced with an arbitration clause, a court of a Member State should decline jurisdiction and refer the parties to arbitration, at the request of one of the parties, unless that court finds that the arbitration agreement relied upon has lapsed, is inoperative or cannot be applied in the dispute before it, following scrutiny within the scope of its own jurisdiction, in the light of the requirements of domestic law, ( [138](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0138) ) since the Brussels I Regulation does not regulate the conditions governing the validity of such a clause. ( [139](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0139) ) The same would apply to clauses designating a national court which are not covered by Article 23 of the regulation.\n\n122.\n\nHowever, the principle requiring effective implementation of the prohibition under EU law of agreements, decisions and concerted practices, to which the Landgericht refers, can, in my view, be invoked vis-à-vis the jurisdiction or arbitration clauses at issue for the purpose, in particular, of ensuring that all persons have the right to seek full compensation for losses resulting from a prohibited agreement, such as those alleged in the main proceedings.\n\n123.\n\nIn this connection, it is to be observed that the Court held in the judgment in Eco Swiss, which concerns the relationship between arbitration and the competition rules under EU law, that Article 85 of the Treaty, now Article 101 TFEU, ‘may be regarded as a matter of public policy’. ( [140](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0140) ) The Court held that ‘where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with [that article]. Community law requires that questions concerning the interpretation of the prohibition laid down in [that article] should be open to examination by national courts when asked to determine the validity of an arbitration award and that it should be possible for those questions to be referred, if necessary, to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling’. ( [141](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0141) )\n\n124.\n\nBy analogy, I consider that national courts are required by EU law not to apply an arbitration clause, or a jurisdiction clause not governed by Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation, in cases where the implementation of such a clause would hamper the effectiveness of Article 101 TFEU. In this connection, it may with advantage be noted that the judgment in Eco Swiss predates those in Courage and Crehan and Manfredi and Others, which upheld the recognition in EU law of a right to compensation for all damage suffered by persons adversely affected by unlawful barriers to free competition, not only in the interests of those persons but above all in order to preserve the general interests bound up with that freedom. The case-law after those two judgments has further reinforced that approach, by encouraging the private implementation of those competition rules (commonly known as ‘private enforcement’), particularly following the removal of the potential obstacles deriving from national provisions. ( [142](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0142) )\n\n125.\n\nIt is true that the application of jurisdiction or arbitration clauses is not in itself an obstacle to the effectiveness of Article 101 TFEU within the meaning of the case-law cited. In particular, the fact that clauses of this type may, if they are valid and applicable to the dispute concerned, entail the ousting of the special bases of jurisdiction provided for in Articles 5 and/or 6 of the Brussels I Regulation does not necessarily have the effect of depriving the persons allegedly adversely affected by damage caused by an unlawful cartel agreement of the possibility of obtaining full compensation on that basis, given that they are not prevented from bringing actions before each of the appointed national or arbitration courts, even though, given the wide variety of clauses relied upon in this case, their application would certainly be likely to render such a course of action more difficult.\n\n126.\n\nNone the less, I consider that it is a matter of some delicacy to put that theoretical position into practice in the particular context of an unlawful cartel agreement, involving numerous participants and persons allegedly adversely affected, whose implementation has generated a multitude of individual supply contracts, possibly concluded between different companies in the group to which a vendor or purchaser belongs. ( [143](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0143) ) In the case of a horizontal restriction of competition, such as that on which the main proceedings are based, I find it difficult to accept an exclusion of the normal forms of judicial protection, unless the parties allegedly adversely affected have expressly entered into an agreement to that effect and the national or arbitration courts to which jurisdiction has been assigned in this way are required to apply the provisions of EU competition law as rules of public policy.\n\n4. The applicability of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in a dispute such as that in the main proceedings\n\n127.\n\nThe essential problem, which will arise by way of a preliminary consideration for the national court, is whether the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses relied upon by the defendants in the main proceedings are really apt to come into play in this case. Admittedly, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, ( [144](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0144) ) it is only the court before which the main action was brought that may, and indeed must, assess the validity and scope of the jurisdiction clause relied upon against it. Although the order for reference is not explicit in this regard, the Landgericht Dortmund appears to take the view that the subject-matter of the dispute could be covered by the two types of clause included in the supply contracts which are binding on the defendants in the main proceedings.\n\n128.\n\nHowever, as CDC and the Commission both contend, there is considerable doubt as to whether the rights to claim damages invoked by the applicant in the main proceedings are derived from the contracts which contained those clauses.\n\n129.\n\nBy analogy with the Court’s ruling in relation to jurisdiction clauses covered by Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation, ( [145](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0145) ) I find it hard to accept that jurisdiction based on the provisions of that regulation could be excluded when the application of the law of a Member State allows another type of jurisdiction or arbitration clause to govern all disputes arising out of the relationship between a party and the other party to the contract and stemming from relationships other than that in connection with which the clause at issue was agreed. The requirement of a close connection between the clause invoked and a particular legal relationship also seems to be necessary here, in order to guarantee the predictability of jurisdiction.\n\n130.\n\nIn my opinion, the rights relied upon in this case derive, instead, from the tort consisting of the cartel agreement arranged and put in hand, covertly, by the defendants in the main proceedings. The issue in the case in the main proceedings is the pecuniary consequences of that fraudulent conduct, which is inherently different from the supply contracts invoked. ( [146](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0146) ) It is not possible that a clause conferring jurisdiction or an arbitration clause should have been validly agreed in such circumstances, in other words, even before the persons allegedly adversely affected knew of the event giving rise to the damage or of the loss so occasioned.\n\n131.\n\nAfter all, the referring court too tends towards this interpretation of the nature of the case in the main proceedings, for it appears to take the view, particularly in relation to its second question, that the civil liability action pending before it comes under matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, covered by Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, and not under matters relating to a contract, which are covered by Article 5(1) of the regulation. ( [147](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0147) ) Nevertheless, in certain national legal systems, the classification of the subject-matter of a dispute as a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict does not in itself preclude the applicability of jurisdiction or arbitration clauses, which obviously depends, in each specific case, on the wording of the clause concerned. ( [148](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0148) )\n\n132.\n\nIn consequence, I consider that Article 101 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action for compensation for damage caused by an agreement declared to be contrary to that article, the implementation of jurisdiction and/or arbitration clauses does not in itself compromise the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices. In so far as a clause of one or other of those categories could be declared applicable, pursuant to the law of a Member State, in a dispute concerning liability in matters of tort, delict or quasi-delict that might follow from such an agreement, that principle, in my view, precludes jurisdiction over that dispute being attributed under a clause of a contract whose content had been agreed when the party against whom that clause is relied on was unaware of the cartel agreement in question and of its unlawful nature, and could not, therefore, have foreseen that the clause could apply to the damages sought on that basis.\n\nV – Conclusion\n\n133.\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court of Justice should answer the questions referred to it for a preliminary ruling by the Landgericht Dortmund (Germany), as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n(a)\n\nArticle 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters is to be interpreted as meaning that, when proceedings are brought against a defendant domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court of one Member State and against defendants domiciled in other Member States of the European Union before that court for disclosure and damages on account of a single continuous infringement of Article 81 EC (Article 101 TFEU), which has been established by the European Commission and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient for the cases to be prepared and tried together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\n\n(b)\n\nArticle 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the action against the sole co-defendant domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court seised is withdrawn does not affect the application of that provision, always provided, on the one hand, that the withdrawal occurred after the date on which that court had been validly seised and, on the other hand, that it is not connected with a binding transaction entered into between the applicant and that defendant before that date but which was concealed for the sole purpose of removing one of the other defendants from the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled.\n\n(2)\n\nArticle 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 is to be interpreted as meaning that, when defendants established in various Member States are sued for damages on account of a cartel agreement, declared by a decision of the European Commission to constitute a single continuous infringement of Article 81 EC (Article 101 TFEU), in which the defendants have participated in several Member States and in various places and at various times, the event giving rise to the damage is not to be regarded as having taken place, in relation to every defendant and in respect of all the heads of damage or the overall loss, in every one of the Member States in whose territory the unlawful cartel agreement was concluded and/or put into effect.\n\n(3)\n\nArticle 101 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action for compensation for damage caused by an infringement of that article, the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices under EU law does not preclude the implementation of clauses conferring jurisdiction consistent with Article 23 of Regulation No 44/2001, whereas that principle does preclude the implementation of arbitration and/or jurisdiction clauses not covered by Article 23 when the national law applicable allows jurisdiction for that dispute to be attributed under a clause in a contract whose content had been agreed when the party against whom that clause is relied upon was unaware of the cartel agreement in question and of its unlawful nature.\n\n---\n\n( [1](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0001) ) Original language: French.\n\n( [2](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0002) ) [OJ 2001 L 12, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2001:012:TOC).

In that connection, it will suffice to point out that the questions raised by the referring court in the factual and regulatory context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court, enjoy a presumption of relevance which can be overturned only in a limited number of circumstances (see, inter alia, the judgment in Pohotovost’, C‑470/12, [EU:C:2014:101](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A101\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 27 et seq.), circumstances which, in my view, do not prevail in this case.\n\n( [38](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0038) ) In particular, according to FMC Foret, the courts of a Member State should have jurisdiction only to rule on claims based on the part of the unlawful cartel agreement which was entered into or which produced its effects in that State, whereas Solvay submits that a close link between the court seised and the dispute should be established, by way of a connecting factor for establishing jurisdiction, separately with respect to every defendant and for the overall damage alleged.\n\n( [39](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0039) ) See, inter alia, the judgments in Réunion européenne and Others (C‑51/97, [EU:C:1998:509](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1998%3A509\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null),

and 20).\n\n( [42](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0042) ) In matters relating to tort and delict, the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred are usually the most appropriate for deciding the case, in particular on grounds of proximity and ease of taking evidence (see, inter alia, the judgment in Melzer, [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 27.\n\n( [43](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0043) ) In footnote 34 of this Opinion.\n\n( [44](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0044) ) See, inter alia, the judgment in Coty Germany ([EU:C:2014:1318](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1318\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 47 and 48).\n\n( [45](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0045) ) The referring court indicates that this problem arises ‘[e]ven assuming that liability is attributed to all the defendants, on the ground that the infringement at issue is a single and continuous infringement committed by a number of co-perpetrators contrary to Article 81 EC/Article 101 TFEU’.\n\n( [46](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0046) ) See the judgment in LAL-Lithuanian Airlines ([EU:C:2014:2319](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2319\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 28).\n\n( [47](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0047) ) On the other hand, Article 5(3) could, in my view, apply to vertical restrictions of competition — provided that the liability invoked is not of a contractual nature — and to cartel agreements whose scope is geographically limited, seeing that the geographical location of both the anti-competitive act and its effect can be clearly identified.\n\n( [48](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0048) ) See recital 15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n( [49](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0049) ) Regarding the various aspects of the practical implementation of the cartel in this case, see point 18 of this Opinion.\n\n( [50](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0050) ) [EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 40.\n\n( [51](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0051) ) Negative action as a result of a cartel agreement is not equivalent to positive action, because abstention cannot as such be linked to a specific place (see, by analogy, the judgment in Besix, C‑256/00, [EU:C:2002:99](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A99\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 49, where the disputed contractual obligation was an undertaking not to act which was not subject to any geographical limit).\n\n( [52](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0052) ) See Advocate General Cruz Villalón in his Opinion in Hejduk (C‑441/13, [EU:C:2014:2212](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2212\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), point 42), who pointed out that ‘[a] criterion which requires a plaintiff to circumscribe the scope of his action according to territorial criteria which are difficult, if not impossible, to determine, is not a criterion which reflects the spirit of the [Brussels I] Regulation’.\n\n( [53](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0053) ) In my view there should be a distinction between this situation and those, for example, of a classic cartel managed by a trade association or a cartel whose activity is geographically concentrated because of a single venue for meetings, given that in such situations there would not be an equivalent dispersal of damage-causing events.\n\n( [54](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0054) ) Thus, in the judgment in Kone and Others (C‑557/12, [EU:C:2014:1317](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1317\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 30 et seq.), the Court held that ‘a loss being suffered by the customer of an undertaking not party to a cartel, but benefiting from the economic conditions of umbrella pricing, because of an offer price higher than it would have been but for the existence of that cartel is one of the possible effects of the cartel, that the members thereof cannot disregard’.\n\n( [55](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0055) ) In the judgment in Dumez France and Tracoba (C‑220/88, [EU:C:1990:8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1990%3A8\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 20), the Court interpreted Article 5(3) of the Brussels Convention as meaning that the person indirectly adversely affected may bring an action, on that basis, only before the court of the place where the event giving rise to the damage directly produced its harmful effects on the person who is immediately adversely affected.\n\n( [56](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0056) ) It follows from the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation that the latter limits the cases in which a defendant may be sued before the court of the applicant’s domicile (see, in relation to the Brussels Convention, the judgments in Six Constructions, 32/88, [EU:C:1989:68](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A68\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 13 and 14, and Dumez France and Tracoba, [EU:C:1990:8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1990%3A8\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 19).\n\n( [57](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0057) ) In this connection, recital 21 in the preamble to the Rome II Regulation indicates that ‘[t]he connection to the law of the country where competitive relations … are, or are likely to be affected, [which is laid down, in respect of acts restricting free competition, in Article 6 of that regulation] generally … protect[s] competitors, consumers and the general public and ensure[s] the proper functioning of the market economy’.\n\n( [58](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0058) ) Ashton, D., and Henry, D., Competition Damages Action in the EU, Law and Practice, Elgar Competition Law and Practice Series, Cheltenham, 2013, p. 179, point 7.030, emphasise that ‘[i]n the case of a pan-European cartel [the place where the claimant suffered loss] could conceivably be in any Member State, which leads to relatively unrestrained freedom to forum shop in proceedings relating to … abuses with effects felt throughout Europe’.\n\n( [59](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0059) ) [EU:C:1995:61](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1995%3A61\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 33, which indicates that ‘the courts of each Contracting State [to the Brussels Convention] in which the publication was distributed and where the victim claims to have suffered injury to his reputation, [have] jurisdiction to rule solely in respect of the harm caused in the State of the court seised’ (my italics).\n\n( [60](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0060) ) The courts of each Member State are best placed to assess the nature and extent of the damage arising in national territory.\n\n( [61](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0061) ) See the specific example mentioned by Idot, L., in ‘La dimension internationale des actions en réparation. Choisir sa loi et son juge: Quelles possibilités?’, op. cit., paragraph 34.\n\n( [62](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0062) ) [EU:C:2012:664](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A664\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null).\n\n( [63](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0063) ) Pursuant to Article 16(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty [101 TFEU and 102 TFEU] ([OJ 2003, L 1, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2003:001:TOC)), in order to guarantee ‘[u]niform application of Community competition law’, ‘[w]hen national courts rule on agreements, decisions or practices under Article [101 TFEU] which are already the subject of a Commission decision, they cannot take decisions running counter to the decision adopted by the Commission’. The judgment in Otis and Others ([EU:C:2012:684](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A684\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 51), indicates that ‘[t]hat rule also applies when national courts are hearing an action for damages or loss sustained as a result of an agreement or practice which has been found by a decision of the Commission to infringe Article 101 TFEU’.\n\n( [64](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0064) ) [EU:C:2002:99](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A99\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 55. Under the terms of that judgment, ‘the special jurisdictional rule in matters relating to a contract laid down in Article 5(1) of the Brussels Convention is not applicable where … the place of performance of the obligation in question cannot be determined because it consists in an undertaking not to do something which is not subject to any geographical limit and is therefore characterised by a multiplicity of places for its performance’ (my italics).\n\n( [65](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0065) ) A finding of a connecting factor can of course also be made in the context of Article 28 of the Brussels I Regulation, but in a different manner (see footnote 70 of this Opinion).\n\n( [66](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0066) ) See point 44 of this Opinion.\n\n( [67](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0067) ) See, starting from the Court’s first judgment interpreting Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention, the judgment in Kalfelis (189/87, [EU:C:1988:459](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1988%3A459\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 10), then later in relation to Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, inter alia, the judgment in Reisch Montage (C‑103/05, [EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 27 to 30).\n\n( [68](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0068) ) Recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation states that ‘[t]he domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction’ and Article 60(1) provides that, for the purpose of applying the regulation, a company or other legal person is domiciled at the place where it has its statutory seat, central administration, or principal place of business.\n\n( [69](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0069) ) As pointed out in the judgment in Freeport ([EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 53), that condition did not figure in Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention, but was inferred by the Court in the judgment in Kalfelis ([EU:C:1988:459](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1988%3A459\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 12) concerning the interpretation of that provision and was later adopted by the Union legislature, which introduced it into the wording of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n( [70](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0070) ) The condition set out in Article 6(1) of the regulation is formulated in the same manner in Article 28, which defines the concept of connexity in the case of several courts potentially having jurisdiction, whereas Article 6(1), by contrast, provides for an extension of the jurisdiction of the court seised to cover defendants who would not normally fall under its jurisdiction. In the judgment in Tatry (C‑406/92, [EU:C:1994:400](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A400\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 53), relating to Article 22 of the Brussels Convention, which equates to Article 28 of the Brussels I Regulation, the Court held that it is sufficient that there is ‘a risk of conflicting decisions, even if the judgments can be separately enforced and their legal consequences are not mutually exclusive’.\n\n( [71](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0071) ) See the judgment in Painer (C‑145/10, [EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 77) relating to recitals 12 and 15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n( [72](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0072) ) See, inter alia, the judgments in Glaxosmithkline and Laboratoires Glaxosmithkline (C‑462/06, [EU:C:2008:299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A299\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 28) and Painer ([EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 74).\n\n( [73](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0073) ) The judgment in Glaxosmithkline and Laboratoires Glaxosmithkline ([EU:C:2008:299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A299\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 20 et seq.) excludes recourse to that provision where the rules on jurisdiction designed to protect a weak party, contained in Section 5 of Chapter II of the Brussels I Regulation, are applicable.\n\n( [74](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0074) ) Kemira submits that the first part of the first question is inadmissible on the grounds that the referring court may in no circumstances claim jurisdiction on the basis of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, because only the Landgericht Essen (Regional Court Essen, Germany) has jurisdiction ratione loci, not the Landgericht, Dortmund, for the seat of the ‘anchor defendant’ is in Essen. It is true that that provision refers to the court for the place where any one of the defendants in the main proceedings is domiciled, and not to all the courts of a Member State, as does Article 2 of the regulation. Nevertheless, it is acceptable, in my view, for a domestic rule to operate a centralisation of jurisdiction ratione materiae, particularly in the competition field, as in the case of Article 89 of the Act on Restrictions of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, GWB) in Germany, provided that such a rule does not discriminate between cross-border disputes and domestic disputes and exclude the former from the jurisdiction of a court which would normally have jurisdiction both ratione loci and ratione materiae.

As part of its task of interpretation, the Court has already effected a parallel between competition rules laid down in the Brussels I Regulation and more recent rules on conflict of laws also flowing from Union law (see, inter alia, the judgments in Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof, C‑585/08 and C‑144/09, [EU:C:2010:740](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A740\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 43, 74 and 84, and Football Dataco and Others, C‑173/11, [EU:C:2012:642](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A642\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 29 and 31).\n\n( [87](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0087) ) See footnote 6 of this Opinion.\n\n( [88](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0088) ) Also known as the principle of forum perpetuum, or the principle of perpetuatio fori, to use the terminology employed in the order for reference.\n\n( [89](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0089) ) Evonik Degussa, for its part, limited its observations to an objection of inadmissibility directed at this part of the first question, on the grounds that it was hypothetical and irrelevant. In my view, the case-law cited in footnote 37 of this Opinion is sufficient justification for rejecting this objection of inadmissibility.\n\n( [90](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0090) ) [EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs 27 to 31 (my italics).

Given that the Brussels Convention contained an equivalent clause, paragraph 63 of the Schlosser report, cited above, indicated that ‘[t]he 1968 Convention as such in no way restricts the freedom of the parties to submit disputes to arbitration. This applies even to proceedings for which the 1968 Convention has established exclusive jurisdiction. Nor, of course, does the Convention preclude national legislation from invalidating arbitration agreements affecting disputes for which exclusive jurisdiction exists under national law or pursuant to the 1968 Convention’.\n\n( [112](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0112) ) The Court has held that, by excluding arbitration from the scope of the Brussels Convention, on the ground that it was already covered by international conventions, the Contracting Parties intended to exclude arbitration in its entirety, including proceedings brought before national courts, and that that exclusion extends to such a procedure, whose purpose is to appoint an arbitration tribunal, even if that dispute raises the initial question of the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement (See the judgment

all those which sit in EU territory, are required, under primary law, to guarantee effective exercise of the rights deriving from Article 101 TFEU. Thus, only clauses which confer jurisdiction on a court outside that territory could be problematic from the point of view of the principle of full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Union law.\n\n( [117](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0117) ) See point 37 of this Opinion.\n\n( [118](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0118) ) See point 127 of this Opinion.\n\n( [119](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0119) )

pursuing a commercial activity, also by an agreement freely negotiated before the event giving rise to the damage occurred’ which also complies with the other conditions set forth in that article.\n\n( [120](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0120) ) I would point out that an expression of the wishes of the parties in the form of a jurisdiction clause cannot, on the contrary, alter the

(paragraph 31) and point 110 of this Opinion.\n\n( [146](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0146) ) In this connection, the Commission submits that, on the one hand, the High Court of Justice (England and Wales), Queen’s Bench Division, held that a clause conferring jurisdiction referring to the ‘legal relationship’ between the parties did not cover the rights resulting from tortious liability arising from an agreement or concerted practice [judgment in Provimi Ltd. v Roche Products Ltd. (2003) EWHC 961] and, on the other hand, that the Helsingen käräjäoikeus (court of first instance, Helsinki, Finland) ruled, similarly, that an arbitration clause referring to ‘all the rights’ arising from a supply contract did not cover rights to claim damages as a result of a cartel agreement, in that the latter did not flow directly from that agreement but from a situation which was external to the latter, namely the participation of the defendant in a collusive agreement (interlocutory judgment of 4 July 2013, CDC Hydrogen Peroxide Cartel Damage Claims SA v Kemira Oyj, Välituomio 36492 no 11/16750).\n\n( [147](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0147) ) ‘It is apparent from settled case-law that the concept of “matters relating to tort, delict, or quasi-delict” within the meaning of Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation covers all actions which seek to establish the liability of a defendant and which do not concern “matters relating to a contract” within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the regulation. In order to determine the nature of the civil liability claims brought before the referring court, it is important first to check whether they are, regardless of their classification under national law, contractual in nature’ (see, inter alia, the judgments in Engler, C‑27/02, [EU:C:2005:33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2005%3A33\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 29 et seq., and Brogsitter, [EU:C:2014:148](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A148\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph 20 et seq.).\n\n( [148](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0148) ) For example, according to the case-law of the Korkein oikeus (Supreme Court, Finland), an arbitration clause contained in a contract is applicable to a dispute concerning extra-contractual liability where failure to comply with the contract invoked constitutes fraud within the meaning of criminal law (see Korkein oikeus, judgment of 27 November 2008, KKO, 2008:102, available at the following Internet address: http://www.finlex.fi/fi/oikeus/kko/kko/2008/20080102).","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.919788555Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Eco-Swiss":{"title":"","content":"## Keywords\n\n  \n_\n\n1 Community law - Rights conferred on individuals - Protected by the national courts - National rules of procedure - Application for annulment of an arbitration award - Consideration by the court seised of a plea in law alleging infringement of Article 85 of the Treaty (now Article 81 EC)\n\n(EC Treaty, Arts 85 and 177 (now Arts 81 EC and 234 EC))\n\n2 Community law - Rights conferred on individuals - Protected by the national courts - National rules of procedure - Application for annulment of an arbitration award - Examination of the validity under Article 85 of the Treaty (now Article 81 EC) of a contract held valid in the context of an interim arbitration award - Precluded under domestic rules of procedure concerning res judicata - Whether compatible with Community law\n\n(EC Treaty, Art. 85 (now Art. 81 EC))\n\n_\n\n## Summary\n\n  \n_\n\n1 Where domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with the prohibition laid down in Article 85 of the Treaty (now Article 81 EC).

An arbitration award, whether complete or partial, shall not acquire the force of res judicata unless it is a final award. It shall acquire that force from the date on which it is made.\n\n2. However, where, in accordance with the agreement between the parties, an appeal may be made to a higher arbitration tribunal against a complete or partial final award, that award shall acquire the force of res judicata as from the date on which the time-limit for appealing expires or, if an appeal is lodged, from the date on which the decision is given in the appeal proceedings, if and in so far as that decision upholds the award appealed against.'\n\n6 As regards judicial review of arbitration awards, Article 1064 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n`1. An action contesting (a) a final arbitration award, whether complete or partial, against which no appeal may be made to a higher arbitration tribunal or (b) a final arbitration award, whether complete or partial, made on appeal to a higher arbitration tribunal may be brought only by way of an application for annulment or a request-civiel in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n2. An application for annulment shall be made to the Rechtbank, at the registry of which the original of the award must be lodged pursuant to Article 1058(1).\n\n3. A party may lodge an application for annulment as soon as the award has acquired the force of res judicata. The right to bring an action shall expire three months after the date of lodgement of the award at the registry of the Rechtbank. However, where the award, endorsed with an order for its enforcement, is served on the other party to the proceedings, that party may, notwithstanding the expiry of the period of three months referred to in the previous sentence, lodge an application for annulment within three months from the date of such service.\n\n4. An application may be lodged for annulment of an interim arbitration award only together with the application for annulment of the complete or partial final arbitration award.\n\n...'.\n\n7 Article 1065 of the Code provides:\n\n`1. Annulment may be ordered only on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) there is no valid arbitration agreement;\n\n(b) the arbitration tribunal has been constituted in breach of the applicable rules;\n\n(c) the arbitration tribunal has failed to comply with its terms of reference;\n\n(d) the award has not been signed or does not state the reasons on which it is based, contrary to the provisions of Article 1057;\n\n(e) the award or the manner in which it has been made is contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.\n\n...\n\n4. An award may not be annulled on the ground referred to in paragraph 1(c) above if the party pleading that ground took part in the proceedings without raising it in those proceedings despite having been aware that the arbitration tribunal was failing to comply with its terms of reference.'\n\n8 Finally, Article 1066(1) and (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an application for annulment does not operate to stay enforcement of the award, but the court seised of such an application may, if a stay is justified and at the request of either party, order a stay of enforcement pending a definitive decision on the application for annulment. An application for a stay must be based on the existence of a reasonable prospect that the arbitration award will be annulled.\n\nThe main proceedings\n\n9 On 1 July 1986 Benetton, a company established in Amsterdam, concluded a licensing agreement for a period of eight years with Eco Swiss, established in Kowloon (Hong Kong), and Bulova Watch Company Inc. (`Bulova'), established in Wood Side (New York). Under that agreement, Benetton granted Eco Swiss the right to manufacture watches and clocks bearing the words `Benetton by Bulova', which could then be sold by Eco Swiss and Bulova.\n\n10 Article 26.A of the licensing agreement provides that all disputes or differences arising between the parties are to be settled by arbitration in conformity with the rules of the Nederlands Arbitrage Instituut (Netherlands Institute of Arbitrators) and that the arbitrators appointed are to apply Netherlands law.\n\n11 By letter of 24 June 1991, Benetton gave notice of termination of the agreement with effect from 24 September 1991, three years before the end of the period originally provided for. Arbitration proceedings were instituted between Benetton, Eco Swiss and Bulova in relation to the termination of the agreement.\n\n12 In their award of 4 February 1993, entitled `Partial Final Award' (hereinafter `the PFA'), lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank (District Court) te 's-Gravenhage on the same date, the arbitrators directed inter alia that Benetton should compensate Eco Swiss and Bulova for the damage which they had suffered as a result of Benetton's termination of the licensing agreement.\n\n13 When the parties failed to come to agreement on the quantum of damages to be paid by Benetton to Eco Swiss and Bulova, the arbitrators on 23 June 1995 made an award entitled `Final Arbitral Award' (hereinafter `the FAA'), which was lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank on 26 June 1995, ordering Benetton to pay USD 23 750 000 to Eco Swiss and USD 2 800 000 to Bulova by way of compensation for the damage suffered by them. By order of the President of the Rechtbank of 17 July 1995, leave was given to enforce the FAA.\n\n14 On 14 July 1995, Benetton applied to the Rechtbank for annulment of the PFA and the FAA on the ground, inter alia, that those arbitration awards were contrary to public policy by virtue of the nullity of the licensing agreement under Article 85 of the Treaty, although during the arbitration proceedings neither the parties nor the arbitrators had raised the point that the licensing agreement might be contrary to that provision.\n\n15 The Rechtbank dismissed that application by decision of 2 October 1996, whereupon Benetton appealed to the Gerechtshof (Regional Court of Appeal) te 's-Gravenhage, before which the case is pending.\n\n16 By application lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank on 24 July 1995 Benetton also requested that court to stay enforcement of the FAA and, in the alternative, to order Eco Swiss to provide security.\n\n17 By order of 19 September 1995 the Rechtbank allowed only the alternative claim.\n\n18 Benetton lodged an appeal against that decision. By order of 28 March 1996 the Gerechtshof essentially allowed the primary claim.\n\n19 The Gerechtshof took the view that Article 85 of the Treaty is a provision of public policy within the meaning of Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure, infringement of which may result in annulment of an arbitration award.\n\n20 However, the Gerechtshof considered that, in the proceedings before it for stay of enforcement, it was unable to examine whether a partial final award such as the PFA was in conformity with Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure, since Benetton had not lodged an application for annulment within three months after the lodging of that award at the registry of the Rechtbank, as required by Article 1064(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n21 Nevertheless, the Gerechtshof took the view that it was able to examine the FAA in relation to Article 1065(1)(e), particularly as regards the effect of Article 85(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the assessment of damage, since to award compensation for damage flowing from the wrongful termination of the licensing agreement would amount to enforcing that agreement, whereas it was, at least in part, void under Article 85(1) and (2) of the Treaty. The agreement in question enabled the parties to operate a market-sharing arrangement, since Eco Swiss could no longer sell watches and clocks in Italy and Bulova could no longer do so in the other countries which were then Member States of the Community. As Benetton and Eco Swiss acknowledge, the licensing agreement was not notified to the Commission and is not covered by a block exemption.\n\n22 The Gerechtshof considered that, in the procedure for annulment, the FAA could be held to be contrary to public policy, and therefore decided to grant the application for a stay in so far as it related to the FAA.\n\n23 Eco Swiss brought proceedings in cassation before the Hoge Raad against the decision of the Gerechtshof and Benetton lodged a cross-appeal.\n\n24 The Hoge Raad observes that an arbitration award is contrary to public policy within the meaning of Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure only if its terms or enforcement conflict with a mandatory rule so fundamental that no restrictions of a procedural nature should prevent its application. It states that, in Netherlands law, the mere fact that, because of the terms or enforcement of an arbitration award, a prohibition laid down in competition law is not applied is not generally regarded as being contrary to public policy.\n\n25 However, referring to the judgment in Joined Cases C-430/93 and C-431/93 Van Schijndel and Van Veen v SPF [1995] ECR I-4705, the Hoge Raad wonders whether the position is the same where, as in the case now before it, the provision in question is a rule of Community law. The Hoge Raad infers from that judgment that Article 85 of the Treaty is not to be regarded as a mandatory rule which is so fundamental that no restrictions of a procedural nature should prevent it from being observed.\n\n26 Moreover, since it is not disputed that the question whether the licensing agreement might be void under Article 85 of the Treaty was not raised in the course of the arbitration proceedings, the Hoge Raad considers that the arbitrators would have gone beyond the ambit of the dispute if they had inquired into and ruled on that question. In such a case, their award would have been open to annulment pursuant to Article 1065(1)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, because they would have failed to comply with their terms of reference. Furthermore, according to the Hoge Raad, the parties themselves could not have raised the question of the possible nullity of the licensing agreement for the first time in the context of the proceedings for annulment.\n\n27 The Hoge Raad states that such rules of procedure are justified by the general interest in having an effectively functioning arbitration procedure and that they are no less favourable to application of rules of Community law than to application of rules of national law.\n\n28 However, the Hoge Raad is uncertain whether the principles laid down by the Court in Van Schijndel and Van Veen, cited above, also apply to arbitrators, particularly since, according to the judgment in Case 102/81 Nordsee v Reederei Mond [1982] ECR 1095, an arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to an agreement under private law, without State intervention, is not to be regarded as a court or tribunal for the purposes of Article 177 of the Treaty and cannot therefore make references for a preliminary ruling under that article.\n\n29 The Hoge Raad explains that, under Netherlands procedural law, where arbitrators have settled part of a dispute by an interim award which is in the nature of a final award, that award has the force of res judicata and, if annulment of that interim award has not been sought in proper time, the possibility of applying for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award proceeding upon the interim award is restricted by the principle of res judicata. However, the Hoge Raad is uncertain whether Community law precludes the Gerechtshof from applying such a procedural rule where, as in the present case, the subsequent arbitration award, the annulment of which has been applied for in proper time, proceeds upon an earlier arbitration award.\n\n30 In those circumstances, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n`(1) To what extent is the ruling of the Court of Justice in Joined Cases C-430/93 and C-431/93 Van Schijndel and Van Veen v SPF [1995] ECR I-4705 applicable by analogy if, in a dispute concerning a private law agreement brought before arbitrators and not before the national courts, the parties make no reference to Article 85 of the EC Treaty and, according to the rules of national procedural law applicable to them, the arbitrators are not at liberty to apply those provisions of their own motion?\n\n(2) If the court considers that an arbitration award is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the EC Treaty, must it, on that ground and notwithstanding the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.4 above according to which a party may claim annulment of an arbitration award only on a limited number of grounds, one ground being that an award is contrary to public policy, which generally does not cover the mere fact that through the terms or enforcement of an arbitration award no effect is given to a prohibition laid down by competition law], allow a claim for annulment of that award if the claim otherwise complies with statutory requirements?\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraph 4.5 above according to which arbitrators must not go outside the ambit of disputes and must keep to their terms of reference], is the court also required to allow such a claim if the question of the applicability of Article 85 of the EC Treaty remained outside the ambit of the dispute in the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrators therefore made no determination in that regard?\n\n(4) Does Community law require the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraph 5.3 above according to which an interim arbitration award that is in the nature of a final award acquires the force of res judicata and is open to appeal only within a period of three months following lodgement of the award at the registry of the Rechtbank] to be disapplied if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which an interim arbitration award having the force of res judicata has held to be valid may nevertheless be void because it conflicts with Article 85 of the EC Treaty?\n\n(5) Or, in a case such as that described in Question 4, is it necessary to refrain from applying the rule that, in so far as an interim arbitration award is in the nature of a final award, annulment of that award may not be sought simultaneously with that of the subsequent arbitration award?'\n\nThe second question\n\n31 By its second question, which is best examined first, the referring court is asking essentially whether a national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant such an application where, in its view, that award is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty although, under domestic procedural rules, it may grant such an application only on a limited number of grounds, one of them being inconsistency with public policy, which, according to the applicable national law, is not generally to be invoked on the sole ground that, because of the terms or the enforcement of an arbitration award, effect will not be given to a prohibition laid down by domestic competition law.\n\n32 It is to be noted, first of all, that, where questions of Community law are raised in an arbitration resorted to by agreement, the ordinary courts may have to examine those questions, in particular during review of the arbitration award, which may be more or less extensive depending on the circumstances and which they are obliged to carry out in the event of an appeal, for setting aside, for leave to enforce an award or upon any other form of action or review available under the relevant national legislation (Nordsee, cited above, paragraph 14).\n\n33 In paragraph 15 of the judgment in Nordsee, the Court went on to explain that it is for those national courts and tribunals to ascertain whether it is necessary for them to make a reference to the Court under Article 177 of the Treaty in order to obtain an interpretation or assessment of the validity of provisions of Community law which they may need to apply when reviewing an arbitration award.\n\n34 In this regard, the Court had held, in paragraphs 10 to 12 of that judgment, that an arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to an agreement between the parties is not a 'court or tribunal of a Member State' within the meaning of Article 177 of the Treaty since the parties are under no obligation, in law or in fact, to refer their disputes to arbitration and the public authorities of the Member State concerned are not involved in the decision to opt for arbitration nor required to intervene of their own accord in the proceedings before the arbitrator.\n\n35 Next, it is in the interest of efficient arbitration proceedings that review of arbitration awards should be limited in scope and that annulment of or refusal to recognise an award should be possible only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n36 However, according to Article 3(g) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 3(1)(g) EC), Article 85 of the Treaty constitutes a fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market. The importance of such a provision led the framers of the Treaty to provide expressly, in Article 85(2) of the Treaty, that any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article are to be automatically void.\n\n37 It follows that where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with the prohibition laid down in Article 85(1) of the Treaty.\n\n38 That conclusion is not affected by the fact that the New York Convention of 10 June 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which has been ratified by all the Member States, provides that recognition and enforcement of an arbitration award may be refused only on certain specific grounds, namely where the award does not fall within the terms of the submission to arbitration or goes beyond its scope, where the award is not binding on the parties or where recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the country where such recognition and enforcement are sought (Article V(1)(c) and (e) and II(b) of the New York Convention).\n\n39 For the reasons stated in paragraph 36 above, the provisions of Article 85 of the Treaty may be regarded as a matter of public policy within the meaning of the New York Convention.\n\n40 Lastly, it should be recalled that, as explained in paragraph 34 above, arbitrators, unlike national courts and tribunals, are not in a position to request this Court to give a preliminary ruling on questions of interpretation of Community law. However, it is manifestly in the interest of the Community legal order that, in order to forestall differences of interpretation, every Community provision should be given a uniform interpretation, irrespective of the circumstances in which it is to be applied (Case C-88/91 Federconsorzi [1992] ECR I-4035, paragraph 7). It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, unlike Van Schijndel and Van Veen, Community law requires that questions concerning the interpretation of the prohibition laid down in Article 85(1) of the Treaty should be open to examination by national courts when asked to determine the validity of an arbitration award and that it should be possible for those questions to be referred, if necessary, to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.\n\n41 The answer to be given to the second question must therefore be that a national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant that application if it considers that the award in question is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty, where its domestic rules of procedure require it to grant an application for annulment founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy.\n\nThe first and third questions\n\n42 In view of the reply given to the second question, there is no need to answer the first and third questions.\n\nThe fourth and fifth questions\n\n43 By its fourth and fifth questions, which can be examined together, the referring court is asking essentially whether Community law requires a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of the subsequent award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n44 According to the relevant domestic rules of procedure, application for annulment of an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award may be made within a period of three months following the lodging of that award at the registry of the court having jurisdiction in the matter.\n\n45 Such a period, which does not seem excessively short compared with those prescribed in the legal systems of the other Member States, does not render excessively difficult or virtually impossible the exercise of rights conferred by Community law.\n\n46 Moreover, domestic procedural rules which, upon the expiry of that period, restrict the possibility of applying for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award proceeding upon an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award, because it has become res judicata, are justified by the basic principles of the national judicial system, such as the principle of legal certainty and acceptance of res judicata, which is an expression of that principle.\n\n47 In those circumstances, Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying such rules, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n48 The answer to be given to the fourth and fifth questions must therefore be that Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n_\n\n## Decision on costs\n\n  \n_\n\nCosts\n\n49 The costs incurred by the Netherlands, French, Italian and United Kingdom Governments and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.\n\n_\n\n## Operative part\n\n  \n_\n\nOn those grounds,\n\nTHE COURT,\n\nin answer to the questions referred to it by the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden by order of 21 March 1997, hereby rules:\n\n1. A national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant that application if it considers that the award in question is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now Article 81 EC), where its domestic rules of procedure require it to grant an application for annulment founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy.\n\n2. Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n_","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.919788555Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Genentech-AG":{"title":"","content":"OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL\n\nWATHELET\n\ndelivered on 17 March 2016 ( [1](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0001) )\n\nCase C‑567/14\n\nGenentech Inc.\n\nv\n\nHoechst GmbH, formerly Hoechst AG,\n\nSanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH(Request for a preliminary ruling from the\n\ncour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) (France))\n\n‛Reference for a preliminary ruling — Action for annulment of an arbitral award — Competition — Article 101 TFEU — Agreements, decisions and concerted practices — Non-exclusive patent licence agreement — Revocation of patents — No infringement — Effect — Obligation to pay royalties’\n\nI – Introduction\n\n1.\n\nThis request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 101 TFEU. More specifically, the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) asks whether this article precludes an obligation imposed on a licensee under a patent licence agreement to pay royalties for the entire duration of the agreement until its termination, notwithstanding the absence of infringement or the revocation of the licensed patent or patents.\n\n2.\n\nThe request was submitted in the context of an action for annulment of arbitral awards filed by Genentech Inc., a company incorporated under Delaware law (United States of America) (‘Genentech’) against Hoechst GmbH, formerly Hoechst AG (‘Hoechst’) and Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (‘Sanofi-Aventis’), companies incorporated under German law.\n\nII – Legal framework\n\nA – EU law\n\n3.\n\nArticle 101 TFEU provides:\n\n‘1.   The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:\n\n(a)\n\ndirectly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;\n\n(b)\n\nlimit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;\n\n(c)\n\nshare markets or sources of supply;\n\n(d)\n\napply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;\n\n(e)\n\nmake the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.\n\n2.   Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall be automatically void.\n\n3.   The provisions of paragraph 1 may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of:\n\n—\n\nany agreement or category of agreements between undertakings,\n\n—\n\nany decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings,\n\n—\n\nany concerted practice or category of concerted practices,\n\nwhich contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not:\n\n(a)\n\nimpose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives;\n\n(b)\n\nafford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.’\n\nB – French law\n\n4.\n\nArticle 1518 of the Code of Civil Procedure (code de procédure civile) provides:\n\n‘An international arbitral award delivered in France may be challenged only by way of an action for annulment.’\n\n5.\n\nArticle 1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n‘An action for annulment is available only in the following cases:\n\n1.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal wrongly declared itself to have or not to have jurisdiction;\n\n2.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal was improperly constituted;\n\n3.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal issued a ruling without fulfilling the mandate entrusted to it;\n\n4.\n\nWhere the adversarial principle was not observed; or\n\n5.\n\nWhere the recognition or enforcement of the award is contrary to international public policy.’\n\nIII – The facts in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n6.\n\nOn 6 August 1992, Behringwerke AG (‘Behringwerke’), ( [2](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0002) ) a company incorporated under German law, granted a worldwide non-exclusive licence to Genentech (‘the licence agreement’) for the use of a human cytomegalovirus (HMCV) enhancer, making it possible to improve the effectiveness of the cellular process used for the production of proteins (‘the enhancer’). This technology was the subject of European Patent No EP 0173 177 53, issued on 22 April 1992 (‘patent EP 177’), as well as two patents issued in the United States on 15 December 1998 and 17 April 2001 (‘patent US 522’ and ‘patent US 140’, respectively). On 12 January 1999, the European Patent Office (EPO) revoked patent EP 177.\n\n7.\n\nThe licence agreement was governed by German law.\n\n8.\n\nUnder Article 3.1 of the licence agreement, Genentech undertook to pay, as consideration for the right to use the enhancer:\n\n—\n\na one-off fee of DEM 20000 (around EUR 10225) for the costs of issuing the licence;\n\n—\n\na fixed annual research fee of DEM 20000 (around EUR 10225); and\n\n—\n\na ‘running’ royalty of 0.5% levied on the amount of sales of ‘finished products’ ( [3](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0003) ) (‘the running royalty’).\n\n9.\n\nGenentech paid the one-off fee and the annual fee, but never paid the running royalty.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 June 2008, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis made enquiries with Genentech about the finished products using the patented materials and processes, giving rise to the entitlement to payment of the running royalties.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 27 August 2008, Genentech notified Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis of the termination of the licence agreement, which was to take effect two months later. ( [4](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0004) )\n\n12.\n\nOn 24 October 2008, believing that Genentech had used the enhancer in the synthesis of recombinant proteins in order to manufacture Rituxan® ( [5](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0005) ) and other medicinal products without paying the running royalties on the sale of all those medicinal products and had thus infringed the licence agreement, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis lodged an application for arbitration against Genentech with the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (‘ICC’) pursuant to the arbitration clause in Article 11 of the licence agreement. The ICC registered that application under case number 15900/JHN/GFG.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27 October 2008, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis brought an action before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Genentech and Biogen (formerly Biogen Idec) for infringement of patents US 522 and US 140. On the same day, Genentech and Biogen brought an action for revocation of those patents before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n14.\n\nThese two actions were joined before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n15.\n\nOn 11 March 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held, in essence, that there was no infringement of the patents in question and dismissed the action for revocation of the patents, finding that Genentech had not met the required threshold of proof. That decision was upheld on 22 March 2012 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and became final.\n\n16.\n\nBy the third partial award of 5 September 2012 (‘the third partial award’), ( [6](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0006) ) the sole arbitrator chosen by the parties held ( [7](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0007) ) that Genentech had manufactured Rituxan® using the enhancer ‘rightly or wrongly patented for some time in [patent EP 177] and later in [patents US 522 and 140] …’ ( [8](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0008) ) and, on that basis, found that Genentech was required to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis the running royalties on the sale of Rituxan® and products with the same properties. ( [9](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0009) )\n\n17.\n\nThe sole arbitrator held that, originally, Genentech had wanted to use the enhancer without being regarded as an infringer, ( [10](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0010) ) hence the licence agreement. It followed, according to the sole arbitrator, that the commercial purpose of the licence agreement ( [11](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0011) ) was to avert all litigation on the validity of patents US 522 and US 140 during the period of validity of the licence agreement. ( [12](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0012) ) In the arbitrator’s opinion, ‘such a truce [could] not last forever since the [licence agreement was] subject to being terminated on relatively short notice by either party …’. ( [13](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0013) )\n\n18.\n\nHe took the view that, once a patent has been registered, a licensee such as Genentech could be comforted by securing a licence for the use of the patent, unlike a third party who might be deterred from competing with a licensee. The sole arbitrator therefore considered that, under the licence agreement, the registration of the patents was a relevant consideration in order to establish the existence of a commercial purpose for concluding the agreement at issue, even if the question of the validity of the patents was not. He pointed out that a patent dispute could last for years, as evidenced by the parallel disputes in the United States, and incur considerable costs. ( [14](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0014) ) A company such as Genentech therefore had an interest in concluding such an agreement.\n\n19.\n\nConsequently, the sole arbitrator held that any payments made under the licence agreement could not be reclaimed and any payments due thereunder remained due where the patent had been revoked or was not infringed by the licensee’s activity. ( [15](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0015) ) Since the commercial purpose of the licence agreement was to avert all patent litigation, he took the view that the ultimate outcome of the patent proceedings did not require the licensor to refund the royalties received if the patent was found to be invalid. Nor did it release the licensee from its obligation to pay those royalties if, as in Genentech’s case, it had withheld them.\n\n20.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, the sole arbitrator held that, under the licence agreement, Genentech was required to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis the running royalties on the sales of Rituxan® manufactured between 15 December 1998 (when patent US 522 was issued) and 28 October 2008 (when the licence agreement was terminated). ( [16](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0016) )\n\n21.\n\nHe also ordered Genentech to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis EUR 391420.36 plus USD 293565.27 (around EUR 260000) in respect of their representation costs for the period between 9 June 2011 and 5 September 2012.\n\n22.\n\nLastly, he reserved the decisions on the assessment of the quantum of the royalties owed, on the arbitration costs and on other representation costs for the final award.\n\n23.\n\nOn 25 February 2013, the sole arbitrator issued his final award in which he ordered Genentech to pay Hoechst EUR 108322850 plus simple interest in respect of damages, EUR 211250 in respect of arbitration costs, and EUR 634649.88 plus USD 555907.23 (around EUR 490778) in respect of representation costs. ( [17](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0017) )\n\n24.\n\nIn paragraph 219 of the final award, the sole arbitrator finds that, late on in the proceedings, Genentech argued that ‘Hoechst’s efforts to interpret [the licence agreement] so as to enable it to recover running royalties without taking account of whether or not the supposedly licensed products [were] covered by the licensed patents infringed the antitrust rules of the European Union’.\n\n25.\n\nIn this connection, the sole arbitrator held that ‘Genentech [had] not explain[ed] how [EU competition law would be] infringed … [were it to lose] this arbitration. German licence law permits licence agreements for the purpose of using non-patented know-how and may provide for royalties to that end. This cannot be altered by claiming — without providing any further arguments — that the licence infringes [EU competition law]’. ( [18](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0018) )\n\n26.\n\nGenentech brought an action before the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) under Articles 1518 and 1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking annulment of the third partial award, the final award and the addendum.\n\n27.\n\nBy order of 3 October 2013, la cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) dismissed Genentech’s application for joinder of the actions for annulment of the third partial award, the final award and the addendum.\n\n28.\n\nIn the context of the proceedings for annulment of the third partial award, the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) questions whether the licence agreement is compatible with Article 101 TFEU. It observes that the sole arbitrator considered that, during the period of validity of the licence agreement, the licensee was bound to pay the royalties stipulated in the contract even though the revocation of the patent or patents had retroactive effect. It enquires whether such an agreement contravenes the provisions of Article 101 TFEU, in so far as it requires the licensee to pay royalties now without cause on account of the revocation of the patent or patents attached to the rights granted and places the licensee at a ‘competitive disadvantage’.\n\n29.\n\nIn those circumstances, the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘Must the provisions of Article 101 TFEU be interpreted as precluding effect being given, where patents are revoked, to a licence agreement which requires the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patent?’\n\n30.\n\nBy order of 18 November 2015, the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) (France) declared inadmissible the appeal lodged by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis against the judgment of the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 23 September 2014 referring a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\nIV – Procedure before the Court\n\n31.\n\nThis request for a preliminary ruling was lodged at the Court Registry on 9 December 2014. Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French, Spanish and Netherlands Governments and the European Commission submitted written observations.\n\n32.\n\nUnder Article 61(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the parties were invited to answer the Court’s questions in writing, which they did on 18 December 2015.\n\n33.\n\nAt the hearing held on 20 January 2016, Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French, Spanish and Netherlands Governments and the Commission made oral submissions.\n\nV – Assessment\n\nA – Admissibility\n\n1. The link between the question referred and the actual facts of the dispute in the main proceedings\n\n34.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as the French Government submit that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is based on an incorrect factual premiss. Although it concerns the compatibility of the licence agreement with Article 101 TFEU ‘where patents are revoked’, ( [19](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0019) ) only patent EP 177 was revoked on 12 January 1999; patents US 522 and US 140 were not. ( [20](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0020) ) The question referred for a preliminary ruling is therefore devoid of purpose and should be declared inadmissible.\n\n35.\n\nIn my opinion, the fact that the national court refers, in the question raised, to the revocation of ‘patents’ (in the plural) even though only one patent was revoked does not mean that the request for a preliminary ruling is based on an incorrect factual premiss.\n\n36.\n\nIt is clearly apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is well aware of the fact that patents US 522 and US 140 have not been not revoked.\n\n37.\n\nIn that regard, the national court states in page 2 of its request for a preliminary ruling that the technology covered by the licence agreement ‘gave rise to the issue of several patents: European Patent [EP 177] of 22 April 1992, subsequently revoked on 12 January 1999 by the European Patent Office for lack of novelty, American Patent [US 520] of 15 December 1998 and American Patent [US 140] of 17 April 2001’. ( [21](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0021) ) The national court makes no reference to the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140.\n\n38.\n\nFurthermore, in page 3 of the request for a preliminary ruling, the national court refers to the judgment of 11 March 2011 of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California which, it submits, ‘held that Rituxan® did not constitute an infringement of the patents at issue’. It follows that the national court is aware of the content of that judgment which also dismissed the action for revocation lodged against patents US 522 and US 140. ( [22](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0022) )\n\n39.\n\nLastly, even though the sole arbitrator referred in paragraphs 193 and 194 of the third partial award to the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, this error does not appear anywhere in the final award. On the contrary, in paragraph 50 of the final award, the sole arbitrator very clearly states that Genentech’s action for the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140 was dismissed.\n\n40.\n\nWhilst it is true that the three actions for annulment brought before the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) against the third partial award, the final award and the addendum are not joined, ( [23](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0023) ) the documents before the Court clearly show that the three actions are related. In its request for a preliminary ruling, the national court itself treats these three judgments as one and the same. ( [24](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0024) ) It is therefore clear that there is no incorrect factual premiss.\n\n41.\n\nIn any event, the existence or otherwise of the allegedly incorrect factual premiss has no bearing on my proposed answer to the question referred by the national court, which concerns both the revocation of a patent (in this case, patent EP 177) as well as the non-infringement of a patent (in this case, patents US 522 and US 140).\n\n42.\n\nAs the Commission pointed out in its replies to the written questions put by the Court, ‘the sole arbitrator held in the third partial award that the purpose of the [licence] agreement was not to make provision for the reimbursement of royalties or to prevent such royalties being claimed where the patents subsequently proved to be invalid or not infringed. The purpose of the agreement, interpreted in the light of German law and the history of negotiations between the parties, was to protect the user of the patent(s) — namely Genentech — against litigation concerning the patent(s) which could be protracted and costly. Accordingly, the fact that the US patents might be regarded as invalid or not infringed does not alter the extent of Genentech’s obligation to pay the royalties’.\n\n2. The possibility for the Court to give a useful answer to the national court\n\n43.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as the French Government submit that the Court is unable to give a useful answer to the national court.\n\n44.\n\nThe French Government argues that the request for a preliminary ruling does not set out the matters of fact and law required in the context of the application of Article 101 TFEU and, in particular, Commission Regulation (EC) No 772/2004 of 27 April 2004 on the application of Article [101](3) [TFEU] to categories of technology transfer agreements, ( [25](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0025) ) such as the actual circumstances of the functioning and structure of the market in issue, the nature of the licence agreement as a contract between competitors or a reciprocal agreement, and the aspects of German law applicable to that agreement.\n\n45.\n\nIn my opinion, these arguments must be rejected because I find that, in accordance with the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), Article 101(1) and (2) TFEU do not require the annulment of the third partial award. ( [26](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0026) ) The exemption regulations ( [27](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0027) ) mentioned by the French Government apply Article 101(3) TFEU to categories of technology transfer agreements and corresponding concerted practices to which only two undertakings are party, falling within Article 101(1) TFEU. That is not the case here.\n\n46.\n\nIn any event, I do not think that the Court would have sufficient information to conduct such an analysis, if it does not agree with my finding.\n\n47.\n\nThe plea of inadmissibility relating to the application of those exemption regulations could only be upheld if the Court were to disagree with my finding.\n\n3. The power of the national court to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling\n\n48.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis submit that it is impossible to answer the question referred for a preliminary ruling without infringing French law which prevents international arbitral awards being reviewed as to their substance except where there is a flagrant infringement of international public policy. ( [28](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0028) )\n\n49.\n\nFailing such a flagrant infringement (as in the case of a cartel), Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis draw a distinction between situations where the question of the compatibility of an agreement between undertakings with Article 101 TFEU was not addressed in the international arbitral award, thereby endangering the effectiveness of competition law, and situations where this question was indeed raised in the award. In their opinion, in the second situation which arises in the present case, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling would make it necessary for the national court to review the third partial award as to its substance, since the ground for annulment forming the subject matter of this question was raised and debated before the sole arbitrator.\n\n50.\n\nI recall that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts, as provided for in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case pending before it both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court.\n\n51.\n\nWhere questions referred by national courts concern the interpretation of a provision of EU law, the Court is thus bound, in principle, to give a ruling unless it is obvious that the request for a preliminary ruling is in reality designed to induce the Court to give a ruling by means of a fictitious dispute, or to deliver advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions, or that the interpretation of EU law requested bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, or that the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it. ( [29](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0029) )\n\n52.\n\nIn my opinion, there is no evidence to suggest that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is hypothetical or that the interpretation of EU law requested bears no relation to the actual facts or purpose of the main action pending before the national court, which concerns Article 101 TFEU. Furthermore, I consider that the Court has before it the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the question referred.\n\n53.\n\nI also note, purely for information, that the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) declared inadmissible the appeal lodged by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis against the judgment of the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 23 September 2014 referring the present question to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\n54.\n\nConsequently, the question referred for a preliminary ruling is admissible and must be answered.\n\nB – Substance\n\n1. The scope of the review of international arbitral awards in the light of European public policy rules\n\n55.\n\nIn its written observations, the French Government recalls that, in paragraph 32 of the judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that the review by Member States’ courts of international arbitral awards raising questions of EU law may be ‘more or less extensive depending on the circumstances’, according to the rules adopted by the Member States within the framework of their procedural autonomy. On that basis, the French Government submits that the rules of French law under which the French courts are unable to review international arbitral awards as to their substance and are confined, in the context of an action for annulment of an international arbitral award such as that at issue in the present case, to examining ‘flagrant’ infringements ( [30](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0030) ) of international public policy, are consistent with the principle of effectiveness laid down in EU law.\n\n56.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis submit ( [31](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0031) ) that, even though, in its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that a national court hearing an action for annulment of an international arbitral award was required, in accordance with its internal rules of procedure, to uphold an action for annulment based on an infringement of Article 101 TFEU, the French rules of procedure at issue prevent any review of international arbitral awards as to their substance and limit the scope of that review to cases of ‘flagrant’ infringements. ( [32](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0032) )\n\n57.\n\nAccording to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, since the question of the possible incompatibility of the licence agreement with Article 101 TFEU was raised and debated before the sole arbitrator and was rejected by him, it is impossible to answer the question referred for a preliminary ruling without reviewing the third partial award as to its substance, in so far as a licence agreement such as that at issue in this case cannot constitute a restriction by object under Article 101 TFEU and cannot, therefore, constitute a flagrant infringement of Article 101 TFEU.\n\n58.\n\nIn my opinion, limitations on the scope ( [33](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0033) ) of the review of international arbitral awards such as those under French law mentioned by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as by the French Government — namely the flagrant nature of the infringement of international public policy and the impossibility of reviewing an international arbitral award on the ground of such an infringement where the question of public policy was raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal — are contrary to the principle of effectiveness of EU law.\n\n59.\n\nReferring to the system for reviewing the compatibility of international arbitral awards with EU law through the public policy reservation, as established by the Court in its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) — which concerned, as in this case, an action for annulment of an international arbitral award based on an infringement of public policy and was confirmed by the judgment in Gazprom ([C‑536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:316](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), involving an application for the recognition and enforcement of an international arbitral award disputed on public policy grounds — the Court has held that arbitral tribunals ‘constituted pursuant to an agreement’ ( [34](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0034) ) are not courts of the Member States within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU. Consequently, they cannot refer questions for a preliminary ruling. It is therefore for the courts of the Member States, within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, to examine, if necessary by referring a question for a preliminary ruling, ( [35](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0035) ) the compatibility of (international or domestic) arbitral awards with EU law where an action is brought before them for annulment ( [36](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0036) ) or enforcement, ( [37](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0037) ) or where any other form of action or review is sought under the relevant national legislation.\n\n60.\n\nIn other words, the system for reviewing the compatibility of international arbitral awards with substantive EU law through the public policy reservation, whether in the context of an action against recognition and enforcement or an action for annulment, shifts responsibility for the review downstream, namely to the courts of the Member States, rather than upstream, to arbitral tribunals. ( [38](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0038) )\n\n61.\n\nThe task of arbitrators in international commercial arbitration is to interpret and apply the contract binding the parties correctly. In the performance of this task, arbitrators may naturally find it necessary to apply EU law, if it forms part of the law applicable to the contract (lex contractus) or the law applicable to the arbitration (lex arbitri). However, the responsibility for reviewing compliance with European public policy rules lies with the courts of the Member States and not with arbitrators, whether in the context of an action for annulment or proceedings for recognition and enforcement. ( [39](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0039) )\n\n62.\n\nThis system is therefore the opposite of the system of mutual trust established, in particular, by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, ( [40](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0040) ) which entrusts responsibility for ensuring compliance with EU law, applicable to the substance of the dispute, including European public policy rules, to the court hearing the substance of the dispute (the upstream court), and not the downstream court of recognition and enforcement. ( [41](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0041) )\n\n63.\n\nOn that basis, I will examine the two limitations imposed by French law.\n\na) The flagrant or manifest nature of the infringement of public policy\n\n64.\n\nIf the review of an international arbitral award in the light of European public policy rules (which cover only a very narrow category of rules in the EU legal order) had to be limited to manifest or flagrant infringements of Article 101 TFEU, this review would be illusory since agreements or practices liable to restrict or distort competition are ‘frequently covert’, ( [42](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0042) ) which would, in many cases, make it impossible (or excessively difficult) for individuals to exercise the rights conferred on them by EU competition law.\n\n65.\n\nAs Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis conceded in paragraph 21 of their written observations, along with their legal expert in paragraph 5 of her opinion, ( [43](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0043) ) the effect of this extremely limited review would be that it would cover only ‘the most obvious infringements [of Article 101 TFEU], such as price-fixing or market-sharing agreements’. Restrictions by effect would therefore completely evade review by the courts hearing actions for annulment, since a finding that such restrictions exist would require more than a token examination of the substance of the arbitral award, which the French courts are unable to do.\n\n66.\n\nEven if there were a scale of infringements of Article 101 TFEU based on their obviousness and harmfulness including, in particular, restrictions by object and by effect, ( [44](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0044) ) there is nothing in Article 101 TFEU to support the conclusion that these restrictions would be permissible. Indeed, Article 101 TFEU expressly prohibits agreements between undertakings ‘which have as their object or effect’ ( [45](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0045) ) the restriction of competition. Accordingly, either there is an infringement of Article 101 TFEU, in which case the agreement between undertakings at issue is automatically void, or there is no infringement at all.\n\n67.\n\nConsequently, it makes no difference whether the infringement of the public policy rule was flagrant or not. No system can accept infringements of its most fundamental rules making up its public policy, irrespective of whether or not those infringements are flagrant or obvious.\n\nb) The impossibility of reviewing an international arbitral award on the ground of infringement of public policy where the question was raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal, because this would entail a review of the award as to its substance\n\n68.\n\nIn paragraph 36 of its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that Article 101 TFEU (formerly Article 81 EC) constituted ‘a fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the [EU] and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market’. ( [46](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0046) )\n\n69.\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 37 of the judgment in Gazprom ([C‑536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:316](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that the principle of mutual trust is not binding on arbitral tribunals. ( [47](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0047) ) This means that the courts of the Member States are not bound to comply with the answers to questions concerning EU law given by arbitral tribunals, which are not courts of the Member States within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.\n\n70.\n\nConsequently, if Article 101 TFEU is a provision of fundamental importance to the EU legal order, the fact that the parties may have raised and debated the question of the incompatibility of the arbitral award with this provision before the arbitral tribunal cannot be decisive. This is because the conduct of the parties during the arbitration proceedings could have the effect of undermining the effectiveness of that article, since the arbitral tribunal is unable in principle ( [48](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0048) ) to submit a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling and is not necessarily tasked with interpreting and applying EU law.\n\n71.\n\nFor these reasons, the review by a court of a Member State of whether international arbitral awards are contrary to European public policy rules cannot be conditioned by whether or not this question was raised or debated during the arbitration proceedings, nor can it be limited by the prohibition under national law preventing the substance of the award in issue from being reconsidered.\n\n72.\n\nPut another way, one or more parties to agreements which might be regarded as anticompetitive cannot put these agreements beyond the reach of review under Articles 101 TFEU and 102 TFEU by resorting to arbitration.\n\n2. Does Article 101(1) TFEU require the annulment of an international arbitral award such as that at issue in the main proceedings which gives effect to a patent licence agreement providing for the payment of royalties for the entire duration of the agreement, even in the event of the revocation with retroactive effect of a patent covering the technology concerned (in this case, patent EP 177) or where the use of the technology at issue does not entail any infringement (patents US 522 and US 140)?\n\na) Preliminary remarks\n\n73.\n\nIt is apparent from reading the third partial award and the sole arbitrator’s interpretation of the licence agreement that Genentech’s obligation to pay running royalties to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, calculated on the basis of their production of medicinal products using the technology of the enhancer, was not conditional on that technology being or remaining patent protected. ( [49](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0049) )\n\n74.\n\nAccording to the third partial award, the mere use of the technology at issue during the term of the licence agreement was sufficient to trigger the obligation to pay running royalties. ( [50](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0050) )\n\n75.\n\nIn this respect, it is not for the Court to review or call in question the findings of the sole arbitrator and his interpretation of the licence agreement under German law, according to which the licence agreement required royalties to be paid notwithstanding the revocation or non-infringement of one or more patents.\n\n76.\n\nFurthermore, the national court’s question only concerns the interpretation of Article 101 TFEU, rendering Genentech’s references to the judgment in Huawei Technologies ([C‑170/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:2391](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) and to some passages of my Opinion ( [51](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0051) ) in that case, which relate exclusively to Article 102 TFEU, pointless.\n\nb) Arguments of the parties\n\n77.\n\nFor Genentech, the obligation imposed by the third partial award to pay the running royalties at issue where the patent is revoked or where there is no infringement of a licensed patent not only significantly affects trade between Member States, but also constitutes a restriction on competition by both object and effect.\n\n78.\n\nAs regards the effect on trade between Member States, Genentech maintains that, on 2 June 1998, the Commission granted EU-wide marketing authorisation for MabThera® under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. ( [52](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0052) ) According to Genentech, during the relevant period (1998 to 2008), it manufactured ‘rituximab’ with a view to it being marketed in different Member States, mainly the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It notes that the royalties awarded by the sole arbitrator were calculated on the basis of net worldwide sales of finished products for the period between 1998 and 2008 and that, in view of the high volume of sales in the European Union during the relevant period, the restriction on competition resulting from the payment ordered by the sole arbitrator directly affects trade between Member States.\n\n79.\n\nGenentech also explains that it is at a competitive disadvantage on the market, since it is required to pay for the use of a technology which its competitors can take advantage of freely and without charge.\n\n80.\n\nFurthermore, Genentech submits that Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis were rewarded and unjustly enriched by receiving ( [53](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0053) ) running royalties in respect of scientific and technological discoveries to which they contributed nothing. It claims that the international arbitration awards at issue in the main proceedings enabled Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis to ‘tax’ their competitors and impose a financial burden on the pharmaceutical industry in general and on Genentech and its subsidiaries in particular, which pursue their business both in Europe and in the rest of the world, in contravention of EU competition law.\n\n81.\n\nAs regards competition in the strict sense, Genentech claims that Sanofi-Aventis is the second largest pharmaceutical group in Europe in terms of revenue for prescription medicines and is involved in research and development as well as the manufacture of medicinal products in several therapeutic areas. It also states that Sanofi-Aventis is one of the main competitors of Roche (which currently wholly owns Genentech) in the research-based field of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n82.\n\nBy contrast, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis argue that the arbitral awards disputed by Genentech have only a very weak link to the European Union.\n\n83.\n\nThey also submit that the royalties owed by Genentech do not derive from any European patent and that the international arbitral awards in dispute do not have even the slightest impact on Genentech’s sales. Furthermore, they claim that the sole arbitrator ruled on the single question whether Genentech was contractually bound to pay the royalties provided for in the licence agreement and that the royalties awarded to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis in the final award were calculated on the basis of worldwide sales of Rituxan®, only 17% of which related to the European Union, corresponding to approximately EUR 18 million during the period at issue between 1998 and 2008.\n\nc) Assessment\n\n84.\n\nConcerning the assessment of the effect on trade between Member States, I concur with the Commission’s observations in its replies to the written questions put by the Court that it is for the national court to determine whether, in the light of the characteristics of the market at issue, it is sufficiently likely that the obligation to pay royalties, in compliance with the final award and under the licence agreement, exerts a direct or indirect, actual or potential influence on the movement of trade between the Member States, and that this influence is not insignificant. ( [54](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0054) )\n\n85.\n\nAs regards the restriction on competition, the question here is not whether Genentech was commercially disadvantaged by the sole arbitrator’s interpretation of the licence agreement or whether, with the (indisputable) benefit of hindsight, it would not have entered into such an agreement. ( [55](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055) ) The aim of Article 101 TFEU is not to regulate commercial relations between undertakings in a general way, but rather to prohibit some types of agreements between them which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition, in its judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court examined in the light of competition law a contractual obligation under which the licensee of a patented invention was required to pay a royalty for an indeterminate period, and thus even after the expiry of the patent.\n\n87.\n\nIn paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment, the Court held:\n\n‘The possibility cannot be ruled out that the reason for the inclusion in a licensing agreement of a clause imposing an obligation to pay royalty may be unconnected with a patent. Such a clause may instead reflect a commercial assessment of the value to be attributed to the possibilities of exploitation granted by the licensing agreement. …\n\nWhere the obligation to pay royalty was entered into for an indeterminate period and thus purports to bind the licensee even after the expiry of the patent concerned, the question arises whether, having regard to the economic and legal context of the licensing agreement, the obligation to continue to pay royalty might constitute a restriction of competition of the kind referred to in Article [101](1).’ ( [56](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0056) )\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Court, the obligation at issue may infringe Article 101(1) TFEU where the licence agreement either does not grant the licensee the right to terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice or seeks to restrict the licensee’s freedom of action after termination. ( [57](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0057) )\n\n89.\n\nAlthough it is true that that judgment covered slightly different economic and legal circumstances from those at issue in the main proceedings, ( [58](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0058) ) I consider that the case-law can be applied to the present case by analogy.\n\n90.\n\nThe third partial award confirms the fact that Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties flowed not from the use of a technology protected by valid patents, but from the licence agreement alone. ( [59](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059) ) The sole arbitrator’s interpretation of the licence agreement under German law clearly shows that the commercial purpose of the agreement was to enable Genentech to use the enhancer at issue while averting patent litigation. Since Genentech, unlike other users of the enhancer who did not conclude a licence agreement with Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, actually benefited from this ‘temporary truce’ ( [60](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0060) ) for the duration of the licence agreement, the payments for using the enhancer, owed by Genentech under the agreement, were not reimbursable notwithstanding the absence of infringement or the revocation of the patents at issue.\n\n91.\n\nFurthermore, the obligation to pay royalties was stipulated to last only for the duration of the validity of the licence agreement and Genentech was freely able to terminate it by giving very short notice of two months. ( [61](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0061) ) As soon as the licence agreement was terminated, Genentech was therefore in exactly the same position as all other users of the enhancer at issue. ( [62](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0062) )\n\n92.\n\nI also note that Genentech’s freedom of action was not restricted in any way during the period after termination and it was not subject to any clause preventing it from challenging the validity or the infringement of the patents at issue. Indeed, following the termination of the licence agreement, Genentech brought proceedings to revoke the patents before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n93.\n\nGenentech nevertheless submits that the judgment in Windsurfing International v Commission ([193/83](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1986:75](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) demonstrates that Article 101(1) TFEU is infringed if the holder of a patent licence is required to pay royalties calculated on the basis of the net selling price of a product which is not covered by the patent.\n\n94.\n\nIn that judgment, the Court held that, in principle, this method of calculating royalties based on the net selling price of a complete sailboard was of such a nature as to restrict competition with regard to boards which were not covered by a patent. ( [63](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0063) ) The Court noted, in paragraph 65 of its judgment, that the demand for rigs and for boards was separate.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, in that judgment the patent holder had, by means of the clause at issue and in contravention of Article 101(1)(e) TFEU, made the conclusion of the agreement conditional on the acceptance, by its partner, of supplementary obligations ( [64](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0064) ) which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, had no connection with the subject matter of the agreement. In the main proceedings, there is no evidence to suggest that the enforcement of the third partial award would have had the effect of imposing obligations on Genentech which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, would have had no connection with the subject matter of the licence agreement.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the sole arbitrator, the commercial purpose of the licence agreement was to avert patent litigation and, in consequence, the calculation of royalties was wholly independent of the existence or otherwise of a valid patent over the finished product.\n\n97.\n\nConsequently, I consider that Article 101 TFEU does not preclude effect being given, in the event of revocation or non-infringement of patents protecting a technology, to a licence agreement which requires the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patents where, first, the commercial purpose of the agreement is to enable the licensee to use the technology at issue while averting patent litigation and, secondly, the licensee may terminate the licence agreement by giving reasonable notice, even in the event of revocation or non-infringement.\n\n3. Applicability of the exemption regulations on technology transfer\n\n98.\n\nGenentech, Hoechst, Sanofi-Aventis, the Netherlands Government and the Commission filed observations on the application of the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 316/2014 of 21 March 2014 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of technology transfer agreements. ( [65](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0065) )\n\n99.\n\nBy contrast, the French Government submits that, since the question referred for a preliminary ruling concerns the implementation of the licence agreement between 15 December 1998 and 27 October 2008, Commission Regulation (EC) No 240/96 of 31 January 1996 on the application of Article [101](3) [TFEU] to certain categories of technology transfer agreements ( [66](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0066) ) and Regulation No 772/2004 should be applied for the period at issue.\n\n100.\n\nIn my opinion, it is not appropriate to examine the applicability of these three ‘exemption’ regulations in the present case.\n\n101.\n\nBesides the fact that the Court does not have sufficient information in order to conduct such an analysis, there is no need to do so because I consider that, in accordance with the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), Article 101(1) and (2) TFEU does not require the annulment of the third partial award. I note that these exemption regulations apply Article 101(3) TFEU ( [67](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0067) ) to categories of technology transfer agreements and corresponding concerted practices to which only two undertakings are party, falling within Article 101(1) TFEU.\n\n102.\n\nI also consider, for the sake of completeness, that it is necessary to reject Genentech’s observations that its obligation, in compliance with the third partial award, to pay royalties on the basis of all sales of MabThera® constitutes a hardcore restriction under Article 4(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation No 316/2014.\n\n103.\n\nThe documents before the Court do not show that the object or effect of the licence agreement and the third partial award is to restrict Genentech’s ability to determine its prices when selling products to third parties ( [68](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0068) ) or to restrict its ability ‘to exploit its own technology rights’ or ‘to carry out research and development’. ( [69](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0069) )\n\nVI – Conclusion\n\n104.\n\nI therefore propose that the Court should give the following answer to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris):\n\nArticle 101 TFEU does not require, in the event of revocation or non-infringement of patents protecting a technology, the annulment of an international arbitral award giving effect to a licence agreement which obliges the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patents where the commercial purpose of the agreement is to enable the licensee to use the technology at issue while averting patent litigation, provided that the licensee is able to terminate the licence agreement by giving reasonable notice, is able to challenge the validity or infringement of the patents, and retains his freedom of action after termination.\n\n---\n\n( [1](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0001) ) Original language: French.\n\n( [2](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0002) ) Behringwerke subsequently assigned its rights to Hoechst. Hoechst has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis since July 2005.\n\n( [3](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0003) ) Defined in the licence agreement as ‘commercially marketable goods incorporating a licensed product, sold in a form enabling them to be administered to patients for therapeutic purposes or to be used in a diagnostic procedure, and which are not intended or marketed for reformulation, processing, repackaging or relabeling before use’. Under the terms of the agreement, ‘licensed products’ are ‘materials (including organisms) in respect of which the manufacture, use or sale would, in the absence of this agreement, infringe one or more unexpired claims included in the rights attached to the patents under licence’.\n\n( [4](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0004) ) Article 8(3) of the licence agreement provides that ‘the licensee may terminate this agreement and the licences granted pursuant hereto by giving Behringwerke two (2) months’ notice for that purpose, if the licensee decides to stop using the licence rights conferred hereunder’.\n\n( [5](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0005) ) The active ingredient of Rituxan® is rituximab. Since 1998, this medicinal product has been marketed in the United States under the trade name Rituxan® and in the European Union under the trade name MabThera®. It is apparent from the answers provided by Genentech as well as by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis to the written questions put by the Court that the arbitral awards at issue in this case concern worldwide sales of Rituxan®, including the sales of this medicinal product under the name ‘MabThera®’.\n\n( [6](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0006) ) Footnote not relevant to the English version of this Opinion.\n\n( [7](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0007) ) See paragraphs 322 to 330 of the third partial award.\n\n( [8](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0008) ) See paragraph 326 of the third partial award.\n\n( [9](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0009) ) See paragraph 114 of the third partial award.\n\n( [10](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0010) ) See paragraph 299 of the third partial award.\n\n( [11](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0011) ) The sole arbitrator considered that, under German law, which applies to the licence agreement, contracts should be interpreted not only on the basis of their wording, but also on the basis of their genesis, their systematic context and their commercial purpose (see, to that effect, paragraph 255 of the third partial award). He found that the commercial reason that led the parties to enter into the licence agreement was that, when the agreement was concluded, Behringwerke had a patented invention (namely patent EP 177) which Genentech wished to make commercial use of without running the risk of infringing the patent (see, to that effect, paragraph 258 of the third partial award). According to the sole arbitrator, the question of the validity of the patent was not relevant under German law, which recognises the contractual right to royalty payments in a licence agreement even if the patent at issue is ultimately revoked.

This approach was confirmed in Cytec (judgment of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 4 June 2008 in Cytec, No 06-15.320, Bull. civ. I, No 162, p. 4). Both cases concerned an infringement of EU competition law.\n\n( [33](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0033) ) Since the action for annulment concerns, in accordance with Article 1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure, international arbitral awards delivered in France, the subject matter of the review is the international arbitral award itself and not the underlying instrument containing the arbitration clause which gave rise to the arbitration, in this case the licence agreement. It is true that international arbitral awards are not agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article 101 TFEU, but international legal decisions which are not attached to any State legal order and instead fall within the scope of the international arbitral order (see judgment of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 8 July 2015 in Ryanair, No 13-25.846, FR:CCASS:2015:C100797; also see, to that effect, judgments of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 23 March 1994 in Hilmarton Ltd, No 92-15137, Bull. civ. I, No 104, p. 79, and 29 June 2007 in PT Putrabali Adyamulia, No 05-18053, Bull. civ. I, No 250). However, the judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) clearly shows that an international arbitral award must be annulled where it gives effect to an agreement between undertakings which infringes Article 101 TFEU, even if the award itself does not constitute an agreement between undertakings. Otherwise, the parties could put anticompetitive agreements beyond the reach of Article 101 TFEU by inserting arbitration clauses in those agreements.\n\n( [34](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0034) ) See judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34)). I use this term to avoid confusion with some arbitral tribunals which the Court has found fulfil the criteria laid down in the case-law in order to be able to refer a question for a preliminary ruling (see judgment in Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta, [C‑377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), and order in Merck Canada, [C‑555/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:92](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). Based on this case-law, the arbitral tribunals hearing cases within the framework of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) could be regarded as being able to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling. See, to that effect, Basedow, J., ‘EU Law in International Arbitration: Referrals to the European Court of Justice’, Journal of International Arbitration, Vol. 32, 2015, p. 367, p. 376 to 381. Since the number and size of investment arbitrations raising questions on the application of EU law are increasing, particularly in the field of State aid, the possibility for arbitral tribunals to refer questions for a preliminary ruling could help to ensure the correct and effective implementation of EU law.\n\n( [35](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0035) ) See judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point32), [33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point33) and [40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40)). Also see, to that effect, judgment of the Högsta domstolen (Supreme Court, Sweden) of 17 June 2015 in case No T 5767-13, Systembolaget v The Absolute Company, paragraph 23.\n\n( [36](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0036) ) This is the situation of the national court in the present case as well as the Netherlands courts in the case which gave rise to the judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)).\n\n( [37](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0037) ) This was the situation of the Lithuanian courts in the case which gave rise to the judgment in Gazprom ([C‑536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2015:316](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) where the question was whether the international arbitral award at issue was an ‘anti-suit injunction’ contrary to public policy within the meaning of Article V(2)(b) of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on 10 June 1958 (United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 330, p. 3).\n\n( [38](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0038) ) There are of course some exceptions, such as, in particular, the upstream involvement of the (State) court of the seat of the arbitration in its capacity as court supporting the arbitration. However, these exceptions are not directed at ensuring compliance with EU law. See, to that effect, judgment in Rich ([C‑190/89](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A319\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1991:319](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A319\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) which concerned the constitution of an arbitral tribunal.\n\n( [39](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0039) ) The situation may be different in the case of international investment arbitrations where some rules, such as the ICSID convention, do not make any provision allowing the courts of the Member States to review the compatibility of international arbitral awards with European public policy (see, in particular, Articles 53 and 54 of that convention). However, in so far as these legal rules, such as the ICSID convention, are binding on Member States vis-à-vis third countries, they fall within the ambit of Article 351 TFEU. A conflict between the international arbitral order and the EU legal order could be averted if arbitral tribunals were able to submit questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling (see footnote 34).\n\n( [40](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0040) ) [OJ 2012 L 351, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2012:351:TOC).\n\n( [41](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0041) ) See, to that effect, paragraph 33 of the judgment in Renault ([C‑38/98](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2000:225](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) where the Court held that ‘the court of the State in which enforcement is sought cannot, without undermining the aim of the Convention, refuse recognition of a decision emanating from another Contracting State solely on the ground that it considers that national or [EU] law was misapplied in that decision. On the contrary, it must be considered whether, in such cases, the system of legal remedies in each Contracting State, together with the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article [267 TFEU], affords a sufficient guarantee to individuals’. The Court went on to hold in paragraph 34 of its judgment that ‘… an error of law such as that alleged in the main proceedings does not constitute a manifest breach of a rule of law regarded as essential in the legal order of the State in which enforcement is sought’.\n\n( [42](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0042) ) Judgment in Courage and Crehan ([C‑453/99](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A465\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2001:465](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A465\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A465\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point27)).\n\n( [43](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0043) ) Professor Laurence Idot acknowledges that her line of argument would result in the situation whereby, ‘except in exceptional cases where an award gives effect to, for example, a cartel, the State court [could] no longer, when hearing an action contesting the award, debate the substantive question of competition law if it had been raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal’.\n\n( [44](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0044) ) See judgment in CB v Commission ([C‑67/13 P](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2204\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:2204](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2204\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs [48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2204\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point48) to [52](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2204\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point52)).\n\n( [45](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0045) ) My emphasis.\n\n( [46](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0046) ) The Court based this finding on Article 3(g) of the EC Treaty (currently Article 3(1)(b) TFEU). As I explained in point 182 of my Opinion in Gazprom ([C‑536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:2414](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), ‘I do not agree that the [judgment] in Eco Swiss ([C‑126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [36](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point36)) … should be interpreted in such a way that the mere fact that a particular sphere forms part of the exclusive or shared powers of the European Union in accordance with Articles 3 TFEU and 4 TFEU is sufficient to raise a provision of EU law to the rank of public-policy provisions. If that were the case, EU law in its entirety, from the Charter of Fundamental Rights to a directive on pressurised equipment, would be a matter of public policy …’. In point 177 of that Opinion, I explained, by citing paragraph 304 of the judgment in Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission ([C‑402/05 P and C‑415/05 P](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A461\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2008:461](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A461\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), that the notion of European public policy could only cover ‘principles that form part of the very foundations of the [EU] legal order’ to the point that their ‘breach … cannot be tolerated … because such a breach would be unacceptable from the viewpoint of a free and democratic State governed by the rule of law’. These are therefore ‘mandatory rule[s] which [are] so fundamental to the [EU] legal order that [they] cannot be subject to any derogation whatsoever in the context of the case at issue’ (see point 100 of my Opinion in Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, [C‑438/14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A11\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2016:11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A11\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). Articles 101 TFEU and 102 TFEU are, in that sense, fundamental provisions which are essential for the functioning of the internal market, without which the European Union would not function and the breach of which, whether or not flagrant or obvious, would be unacceptable from the standpoint of the EU legal order.\n\n( [47](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0047) ) Also see, to that effect, point 154 of my Opinion in Gazprom ([C‑536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:2414](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)).\n\n( [48](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0048) ) See judgment in Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta ([C‑377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) and order in Merck Canada ([C‑555/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:92](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). In the present case, the sole arbitrator is not a ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ within the meaning of this case-law because his jurisdiction is not binding and is instead the result of a contractual choice freely made by the parties to the licence agreement which gave rise to the arbitral awards at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n( [49](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0049) ) In their replies to the written questions put by the Court, Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French Government and the Commission submit that the third partial award does not concern patent EP 177. The Commission argues that the two US patents (patents US 522 and US 140) are not much more relevant to the third partial award. It contends that, under the law applicable to the licence agreement, namely German law, the revocation or annulment of a patent under licence does not affect the obligation to pay royalties, adding that a licence may be granted under German law even for a technology which is not patented or not patentable. Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis state that it is clearly apparent from the third partial award that the sole arbitrator ordered Genentech to pay the royalties owed to Sanofi based exclusively on the fact that Genentech used the enhancer forming the subject matter of the licence agreement to manufacture Rituxan® in the United States.\n\n( [50](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0050) ) It is not disputed that, according to the US courts, patents US 522 and US 140 are not infringed. The sole arbitrator also found in paragraphs 322 to 330 of the third partial award that the enhancer had been used to manufacture Rituxan® between 15 December 1998 and 27 October 2008. See point 16 of this Opinion.\n\n( [51](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0051) ) [C‑170/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:2014:2391](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab).\n\n( [52](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0052) ) [OJ 1993 L 214, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:214:TOC).\n\n( [53](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0053) ) By order of 3 October 2013, the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) granted leave to enforce the third partial award, the final award and the addendum. The orders and rulings have therefore been enforced.\n\n( [54](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0054) ) According to the Commission, there are factors which suggest that the obligation to pay the royalties at issue may have such an influence. ‘First, the geographic scope of the licence agreement is worldwide and thus includes the whole of the European Union … Secondly, the licence agreement relates to a technology which, in the [sole] arbitrator’s opinion, was used to manufacture rituximab, the active ingredient of the medicinal product MabThera® marketed in the European Union. Thirdly, MabThera® was the subject of marketing authorisation … under Article 3 of [Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93]. Fourthly, it appears that Genentech marketed MabThera® in at least Germany, France and Italy. Fifthly, it appears that Sanofi and [Genentech, now part of the Roche group,] are major competitors in the field of pharmaceutical research and, in particular, are potential competitors within the sphere of action of Rituxan® (and MabThera®). Sixthly, the obligation to pay royalties may add to Genentech’s manufacturing costs and have the effect of reducing competition on existing product and technology markets, particularly within the sphere of action of MabThera®. Seventhly, it appears that Rituxan® and MabThera® generate turnover in excess of one billion euros, enabling them to be regarded as “blockbuster” medicinal products.’\n\n( [55](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055) ) As Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis observed in their replies to the written questions put by the Court, ‘the mere fact that the payment of contractual royalties owed under the licence agreement may possibly constitute a financial burden for the licensee, in this case Genentech, is not sufficient to characterise a restriction on competition. Such a burden simply illustrates the commercial nature of the licence agreement, which was concluded with complete knowledge of the facts by fully informed commercial undertakings of equal strength, and which — as with all other commercial agreements — may turn out to be commercially less advantageous than initially envisaged by one of the parties’.\n\n( [56](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0056) ) My emphasis.\n\n( [57](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0057) ) See judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point13)). Genentech considers that the Commission, in its decision of 2 December 1975 relating to a proceeding under Article [101 TFEU] (IV/26.949 — AOIP v Beyrard) ([OJ 1976 L 6, p. 8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1976:006:TOC)), ‘stated that there is a restriction on competition where a clause of a licensed patent agreement “provides for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor’s patents are exploited”. According to the Commission …, a clause such as this in a licence agreement “is also incompatible with Article [101](1), in the same way as the obligation to pay royalties after the expiration of a patent”’ (my emphasis). Genentech’s observations concern a clause which requires a licensee to pay royalties where it manufactures the products referred to in the agreement without using the licensor’s patents. In that decision, the Commission found that the clause had a restrictive effect on competition because it provided for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor’s patents were exploited. It considered that the clause at issue, like other clauses laying down an obligation to pay royalties after the expiry of a patent, was incompatible with Article 101(1) TFEU. It should be noted that the Commission, like the Court in paragraph 13 of its judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), pointed out that ‘the obligation to pay royalties after the expiration of the … patent … constitutes … an infringement of Article [101] because the licensee does not have the right to terminate the agreement’ (my emphasis).\n\n( [58](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0058) ) The present case concerns the revocation or non-infringement of patents while the case giving rise to the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) concerned the expiry of patents.\n\n( [59](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059) ) According to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the national laws of several Member States provide that, where a patent is revoked, the licensee is entitled to stop paying royalties in the future, but cannot demand reimbursement of royalties already paid.\n\n( [60](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0060) ) See paragraph 315 of the third partial award.\n\n( [61](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0061) ) In the case giving rise to the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the notice period was six months expiring on 1 October of each year.\n\n( [62](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0062) ) By contrast, as the Commission submits in its observations, ‘an obligation to continue to pay royalties, without it being possible to terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice, would add to the licensee’s manufacturing costs without economic justification and would have the effect of reducing competition on the existing product and technology markets and deterring the licensee from investing in the development and improvement of its technology’.\n\n( [63](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0063) ) See judgment in Windsurfing International v Commission ([193/83](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026locale=en), [EU:C:1986:75](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph [67](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point67)).\n\n( [64](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0064) ) The relevant clause of the licence agreement required the licensees to pay royalties for sailboard rigs manufactured under a patent only covering rigs based on the selling price of a complete sailboard, which was made up of rigs and boards, the latter not being covered by the patent.\n\n( [65](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0065) ) [OJ 2014 L 93, p. 17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2014:093:TOC).\n\n( [66](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0066) ) [OJ 1996 L 31, p. 2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1996:031:TOC).\n\n( [67](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0067) ) The three regulations at issue all have Regulation No 19/65 as their legal basis.\n\n( [68](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0068) ) See Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation No 316/2014.

The Belgian courts, including the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen (Court of Appeal, Antwerp, Belgium), had dismissed as inadmissible similar actions brought before them on the ground that the bill of lading, drawn up on 13 August 2006, the date on which Samskip took delivery of the installation in Antwerp (Belgium), contained a contractual clause (‘jurisdiction clause’) stating that any dispute arising thereunder was to be decided by Icelandic courts according to Icelandic law.\n\nLegal context\n\nInternational law\n\n4\n\nThe Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed on 30 October 2007 and approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2009/430/EC of 27 November 2008 ([OJ 2009 L 147, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2009:147:TOC)) (‘the Lugano Convention’), states in Article 23(1), the wording of which is largely similar to that of Article 17 of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, done at Lugano on 16 September 1988 ([OJ 1988 L 319, p. 9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1988:319:TOC)), which it replaced:\n\n‘If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a State bound by this Convention, have agreed that a court or the courts of a State bound by this Convention are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing, or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves, or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.’\n\nEuropean Union law\n\n5\n\nRecitals 2, 6 and 15 to 17 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001 read as follows:\n\n‘(2)\n\nCertain differences between national rules governing jurisdiction and recognition of judgments hamper the sound operation of the internal market. Provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to simplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from Member States bound by this Regulation are essential.\n\n...\n\n(6)\n\nIn order to attain the objective of free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, it is necessary and appropriate that the rules governing jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments be governed by a Community legal instrument which is binding and directly applicable.\n\n...\n\n(15)\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. There must be a clear and effective mechanism for resolving cases of lis pendens and related actions and for obviating problems flowing from national differences as to the determination of the time when a case is regarded as pending. For the purposes of this Regulation that time should be defined autonomously.\n\n(16)\n\nMutual trust in the administration of justice in the Community justifies judgments given in a Member State being recognised automatically without the need for any procedure except in cases of dispute.\n\n(17)\n\nBy virtue of the same principle of mutual trust, the procedure for making enforceable in one Member State a judgment given in another must be efficient and rapid. To that end, the declaration that a judgment is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion any of the grounds for non-enforcement provided for by this Regulation.’\n\n6\n\nUnder Article 23(1) of that regulation, the wording of which is in essence identical to that of Article 23(1) of the Lugano Convention, referred to in paragraph 4 above:\n\n‘If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing, or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves, or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.’\n\n7\n\nArticle 32 of the same regulation provides:\n\n‘For the purposes of this Regulation, “judgment” means any judgment given by a court or tribunal of a Member State, whatever the judgment may be called, including a decree, order, decision or writ of execution, as well as the determination of costs or expenses by an officer of the court.’\n\n8\n\nArticle 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 provides:\n\n‘1.   A judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.\n\n2.   Any interested party who raises the recognition of a judgment as the principal issue in a dispute may, in accordance with the procedures provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this Chapter, apply for a decision that the judgment be recognised.\n\n3.   If the outcome of proceedings in a court of a Member State depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.’\n\n9\n\nAccording to Article 34 of that regulation:\n\n‘A judgment shall not be recognised:\n\n1.\n\nif such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n\n2.\n\nwhere it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so;\n\n3.\n\nif it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n\n4.\n\nif it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State addressed.’\n\n10\n\nArticle 35 of Regulation No 44/2001 provides:\n\n‘1.   Moreover, a judgment shall not be recognised if it conflicts with sections 3, 4 or 6 of Chapter II, or in a case provided for in Article 72.\n\n2.   In its examination of the grounds of jurisdiction referred to in the foregoing paragraph, the court or authority applied to shall be bound by the findings of fact on which the court of the Member State of origin based its jurisdiction.\n\n3.   Subject to the paragraph 1, the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin may not be reviewed. The test of public policy referred to in point 1 of Article 34 may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction.’\n\n11\n\nUnder Article 36 of Regulation No 44/2001:\n\n‘Under no circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.’\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n12\n\nIn 2006, Krones sold a brewing installation to the recipient. It charged Samskip with the task of organising and providing the transport of that installation from Antwerp to Guadalajara (Mexico), via Altamira, another city in Mexico.\n\n13\n\nThe consignment, which consisted of containers and transport frames, was delivered to Samskip on 13 August 2006. On that same day Samskip drew up the bill of lading designating Krones as the shipper, the recipient as the consignee, Antwerp as the port of loading and Altamira as the port of destination. Point 2 of the terms and conditions (‘Endorsements’) set out on the reverse side of that document stipulates:\n\n‘Jurisdiction. Any dispute arising under this Bill of Lading to be decided in Iceland according to Icelandic law.’\n\n14\n\nThe applicants in the main proceedings claim that the consignment was damaged during the transport by sea and that part of it was also damaged during the transport by land from Altamira to Guadalajara. Krones assigned its claims in respect of the maximum insurable amount of two special drawing rights (valued at the time of assignment at EUR 235 666.46) to the insurers in proportion to their percentage share of the risk. The recipient likewise assigned its claims under the bill of lading to the insurers in proportion to their percentage share of the risk.\n\n15\n\nThe recipient and the insurers brought the matter before the Belgian courts by an action lodged on 30 August 2007 and requested that Samskip appear before the Rechtbank van koophandel te Antwerpen (Antwerp Commercial Court) on 16 October 2007. That court ruled in favour of the insurers and the recipient, but the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen revised that judgment by its judgment of 5 October 2009, by which it declared itself ‘to have no authority to hear and decide the case’.\n\n16\n\nIn its reasons for judgment, the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen held that the recipient was not entitled to bring proceedings on the basis of the contract of carriage. The insurers did have the right to institute proceedings as successors in title to Krones, but they were bound by the jurisdiction clause contained in the bill of lading. Under point 2 of the clauses therein, the Icelandic courts have exclusive jurisdiction, and for that reason the Belgian courts have no authority to hear and decide the case. That judgment has become final.\n\n17\n\nIn September 2010, the insurers brought an action for compensation against Samskip before the Landgericht Bremen (Regional Court, Bremen), whilst Krones brought an action for compensation against Samskip before the Landgericht Landshut (Regional Court, Landshut). That court referred the latter proceedings to the referring court by order of 3 June 2011.\n\n18\n\nThe Landgericht Bremen observes that, in Samskip’s submission, the actions are inadmissible inasmuch as the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5 October 2009 produces legal effects not only as regards the Belgian courts’ lack of jurisdiction but also as regards the finding that jurisdiction lies with the Icelandic courts, as stated in the grounds of that judgment. Samskip states that that judgment has binding effect on the referring court in accordance with Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n19\n\nThe insurers and Krones argue that, at most, binding effect extends to that part of the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5 October 2009 which finds that the Belgian courts have no jurisdiction. The effect of that judgment extends no further, however, and certainly not so far as to mean that, as a result of the asserted jurisdiction of the Icelandic courts, courts of Member States other than the Kingdom of Belgium have no jurisdiction.\n\n20\n\nThe referring court, citing German legal doctrine, observes that the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5 October 2009 is a ‘judgment on a procedural matter’ (‘Prozessurteil’) which dismisses the action as inadmissible by reason of its failure to satisfy the requirements for a judgment on the merits of the case. Such judgments given by foreign courts are for the most part not regarded as being capable of recognition under German law. It therefore wonders whether it is bound to recognise that judgment and, if so, whether the scope of such recognition extends to the reasons for judgment contained therein as well.\n\n21\n\nIn those circumstances, the Landgericht Bremen decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘1.\n\nAre Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that the term “judgment” also covers in principle those judgments which are restricted to the finding that the procedural requirements for admissibility are not satisfied (so-called “procedural judgments”)?\n\n2.\n\nAre Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that the term “judgment” also covers a judgment ending proceedings by which a court declines international jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause?\n\n3.\n\nHaving regard to the case‑law of the Court of Justice on the principle of extended effect (Case [145/86 Hoffmann [1988] ECR 645](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=61986??0145\u0026locale=EN)), are Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that each Member State is required to recognise the judgments of a court of another Member State on the effectiveness of a jurisdiction clause agreed on by the parties, where the finding as to the effectiveness of the jurisdiction clause has become final under the national law of that court – even where the decision on the point forms part of a procedural judgment dismissing the action?’\n\nThe question referred for a preliminary ruling\n\nThe first and second questions\n\n22\n\nBy its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 32 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, even though that judgment is classified as a ‘procedural judgment’ by the law of another Member State.\n\n23\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that, in accordance with the wording of Article 32 of Regulation No 44/2001, the concept of ‘judgment’ covers ‘any’ judgment given by a court of a Member State, without any distinction being drawn according to the content of the judgment in question, which means that, in principle, that concept also comprises a judgment by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause.\n\n24\n\nThe Court has held that Article 25 of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ([OJ 1972 L 299, p. 32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1972:299:TOC)), the Court’s interpretation of which also holds true, in principle, for the corresponding provision of Regulation No 44/2001 (see, to that effect, Case [C-406/09 Realchemie Nederland [2011] ECR I-9773](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62009C?0406\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 38), namely Article 32 of that regulation, is not limited to decisions which terminate a dispute in whole or in part, but also applies to provisional or interlocutory decisions (Case [C-39/02 Mærsk Olie \u0026 Gas [2004] ECR I-9657](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62002C?0039\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 46).\n\n25\n\nMoreover, according to the Court’s settled case‑law, the provisions of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted independently, by reference to its scheme and purpose (see, to that effect, Case [C-103/05 Reisch Montage [2006] ECR I-6827](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62005C?0103\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 29; Case [C-167/08 Draka NK Cables and Others [2009] ECR I-3477](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62008C?0167\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 19; and Case [C-189/08 Zuid-Chemie [2009] ECR I-6917](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62008C?0189\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 17).\n\n26\n\nOne of the objectives of Regulation No 44/2001, as evidenced by recital 2 in the preamble thereto, is to ‘simplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from [the] Member States’ bound by that regulation, which also tends to support an interpretation of the concept of ‘judgment’ which does not take into account the categorisation under a Member State’s law of a decision by a court of that Member State, be it the law of the Member State of origin or that of the Member State in which recognition is sought. An interpretation of that concept based on the particularities of each national legal order would give rise to considerable obstacles in the achievement of that objective.\n\n27\n\nMoreover, recital 6 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001 refers to ‘the objective of free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters’. That objective supports the position that the concept of ‘judgment’ for the purposes of Article 32 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as encompassing judgments by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause. A failure to recognise such judgments could seriously undermine the free movement of judgments.\n\n28\n\nAs regards the system introduced by Regulation No 44/2001, recitals 16 and 17 in the preamble thereto underline the importance of the principle of mutual trust between the courts of the Member States in the recognition and enforcement of judgments, which also implies that that concept is not to be interpreted restrictively, in order to avoid, inter alia, disputes as to what constitutes a ‘judgment’.\n\n29\n\nThat mutual trust would be undermined if a court of a Member State could refuse to recognise a judgment by which a court of another Member State declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause. To allow a court of a Member State to refuse to recognise such a judgment would run counter to the system introduced by Regulation No 44/2001, because such a refusal would be liable to compromise the effective operation of the rules set out in Chapter II of that regulation on the distribution of jurisdiction as between the courts of the Member States.\n\n30\n\nAs observed by the Advocate General in points 49 and 50 of his Opinion, Articles 33 to 35 of Regulation No 44/2001 also militate against a restrictive interpretation of the concept of ‘judgment’ for the purposes of Article 32 thereof. Article 33 sets out the principle that judgments are to be recognised, whilst Articles 34 and 35 provide for exceptions to that principle, which must be interpreted restrictively. Moreover, Article 35(3) provides that the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin may not be reviewed and that the test of public policy may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction.\n\n31\n\nA restrictive interpretation of the concept of judgment would give rise to a category of judicial decisions which are not among the exhaustively-listed exceptions set out in Articles 34 and 35 of Regulation No 44/2001, which could not be categorised as ‘judgments’ for the purposes of Article 32 and which the courts of other Member States would accordingly not be obliged to recognise. It is clear that such a category of decisions, including in particular those by which a court in another Member State declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, would be incompatible with the system established by Articles 33 to 35 of Regulation No 44/2001, which favours the unimpeded recognition of judgments and rules out the possibility of review of the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin by the courts of the Member State in which recognition is sought.\n\n32\n\nIn the light of all the considerations set out above, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article 32 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which the court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, irrespective of how that judgment is categorised under the law of another Member State.\n\nThe third question\n\n33\n\nBy its third question the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding – made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible – regarding the validity of that clause.\n\n34\n\nAs the Court has observed, referring to the Report of 27 September 1968 on the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, drawn up by Mr Jenard ([OJ 1979 C 59, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:C:1979:059:TOC)), recognition must ‘have the result of conferring on judgments the authority and effectiveness accorded to them in the State in which they were given’ (Hoffmann, paragraph 10). Accordingly, a foreign judgment which has been recognised under Article 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 must in principle have the same effects in the State in which recognition is sought as it does in the State of origin (see, to that effect, Hoffmann, paragraph 11).\n\n35\n\nMoreover, as observed in paragraph 28 above, the principle of mutual trust between courts underlies the system established by Regulation No 44/2001. As observed by the Advocate General in point 73 of his Opinion, a high degree of mutual trust is all the more necessary where the courts of the Member States are called on to apply common rules of direct jurisdiction. Thus, those rules and the rules on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in that regulation do not constitute distinct and autonomous systems but are closely linked (Case [C-514/10 Wolf Naturprodukte [2012] ECR, paragraph 25). It is on that link that rests the simplified mechanism of recognition and enforcement set out in Article 33(1) of that regulation, under which a judgment given in a Member State is in principle to be recognised in the other Member States and which leads, pursuant to Article 35(3) of that regulation, to there being no review of the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State of origin (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/03 [2006] ECR I-1145](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62010C?0514\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 163).\n\n36\n\nArticle 23 of Regulation No 44/2001, relating to contractual agreements as to jurisdiction, does not apply in the main proceedings because the jurisdiction clause at issue here confers jurisdiction on the courts in the Republic of Iceland, which is not a Member State. However, as observed by the Advocate General in point 76 of his Opinion, the Lugano Convention, to which the Republic of Iceland is a party, contains in Article 23 a provision corresponding to Article 23 of that regulation. If a court of the Member State of origin, in the assessment of its own jurisdiction, has held such a jurisdiction clause to be valid, it would in principle be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between the courts of the European Union to allow a court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to review that very same issue of validity.\n\n37\n\nIt is, moreover, apparent from Article 36 of Regulation No 44/2001 that, in accordance with the principle of mutual trust, the judgment of the court of the Member State of origin may ‘[u]nder no circumstances … be reviewed as to its substance’. It is stated on page 46 of the report drawn up by Mr Jenard that ‘[t]he absence of any review of the substance of the case implies complete confidence in the court of the State in which judgment was given; it is similarly to be assumed that that court correctly applied the [harmonised] rules of jurisdiction’.\n\n38\n\nTo allow a court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to disregard, as devoid of effect, the jurisdiction clause which a court of the Member State of origin has held to be valid would run counter to that prohibition of a review as to the merits, particularly in circumstances where the latter might well have ruled, but for that clause, that it had jurisdiction. In the latter situation, such a finding on the part of the court of the Member State in which recognition is sought would call into question not only the intermediate finding made by the court of the Member State of origin as to the validity of the jurisdiction clause, but also the very decision of that court to decline its own jurisdiction.\n\n39\n\nAs observed by the Advocate General in point 82 of his Opinion, the exclusion of review of the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin implies, as a correlation, a restriction of the power of the court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to ascertain its own jurisdiction because the latter is bound by what was decided by the court of the Member State of origin. The requirement of the uniform application of European Union law means that the specific scope of that restriction must be defined at European Union level rather than vary according to different national rules on res judicata.\n\n40\n\nMoreover, the concept of res judicata under European Union law does not attach only to the operative part of the judgment in question, but also attaches to the ratio decidendi of that judgment, which provides the necessary underpinning for the operative part and is inseparable from it (see, inter alia, Joined Cases [C-442/03 P and C-471/03 P P \u0026 O European Ferries (Vizcaya) and Diputación Foral de Vizcaya v Commission [2006] ECR I-4845](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62003C?0442\u0026locale=EN), paragraph 44, and Case C‑221/10 P Artegodan v Commission [2012] ECR, paragraph 87). As observed in paragraph 35 above, given that the common rules of jurisdiction applied by the courts of the Member States have their source in European Union law, more specifically in Regulation No 44/2001, and given the requirement of uniform application referred to in paragraph 39 above, the concept of res judicata under European Union law is relevant for determining the effects produced by a judgment by which a court of a Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause.\n\n41\n\nThus, a judgment by which a court of a Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, on the ground that that clause is valid, binds the courts of the other Member States both as regards that court’s decision to decline jurisdiction, contained in the operative part of the judgment, and as regards the finding on the validity of that clause, contained in the ratio decidendi which provides the necessary underpinning for that operative part.\n\n42\n\nThis approach is not called into question by the argument put forward by the Federal Republic of Germany, based inter alia on paragraph 66 of the judgment in Case [C-420/07 Apostolides [2009] ECR I-3571](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62007C?0420\u0026locale=EN), according to which there is no reason for granting to a judgment, when it is enforced, rights which it does not have in the Member States in question. The recognition of judgments, handed down by courts of Member States, declining jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001 which are delivered – as observed in paragraph 35 above – pursuant to common rules of jurisdiction provided for by European Union law, is governed by its own sui generis system, as described in paragraphs 39 to 41 above.\n\n43\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the answer to third question is that Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding – made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible – regarding the validity of that clause.\n\nCosts\n\n44\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n \n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n \n\n1.\n\nArticle 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which the court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, irrespective of how that judgment is categorised under the law of another Member State.\n\n \n\n2.\n\nArticles 32 and 33 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding – made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible – regarding the validity of that clause.\n\n \n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n( [*1](#c-ECR_62011CJ0456_EN_01-E0001) ) Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.919788555Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Ingmar":{"title":"","content":"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)\n\n9 November 2000 (1)\n\n(Directive 86/653/EEC - Self-employed commercial agent carrying on his activity in a Member State - Principal established in a non-member country - Clause submitting the agency contract to the law of the country of establishment of the principal)\n\nIn Case C-381/98,\n\nREFERENCE to the Court under Article 177 of the EC Treaty (now Article 234 EC) by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division), United Kingdom, for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between\n\nIngmar GB Ltd\n\nand\n\nEaton Leonard Technologies Inc.\n\non the interpretation of Council Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents (OJ 1986 L 382, p. 17),\n\nTHE COURT (Fifth Chamber),\n\ncomposed of: M.

('Eaton‘), a company established in California, concerning the payment of sums claimed to be due on account, in particular, of the termination of an agency contract.\nLegal framework\n\nCommunity legislation\n\n3.\n    In the second recital in its preamble it is stated that the Directive was adopted in the light of the fact that 'the differences in national laws concerning commercial representation substantially affect the conditions of competition and the carrying-on of that activity within the Community and are detrimental both to the protection available to commercial agents vis-à-vis their principals and to the security of commercial transactions‘.\n4.\n    Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive specify the circumstances in which the commercial agent is entitled, on termination of the contract, to an indemnity or to compensation for the damage he suffers as a result of the termination of his relations with the principal.\n5.\n    Article 17(1) of the Directive provides:\n'[M]ember States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the commercial agent is, after termination of the agency contract, indemnified in accordance with paragraph 2 or compensated for damage in accordance with paragraph 3.‘\n\n6.\n    Article 19 of the Directive provides:\n'[T]he parties may not derogate from Articles 17 and 18 to the detriment of the commercial agent before the agency contract expires.‘\n\n7.\n    Under Article 22(1) and (3) thereof, the Directive was to be implemented before 1 January 1990 and, with regard to the United Kingdom, before 1 January 1994. Under Article 22(1), the national provisions implementing the Directive must apply at least to contracts concluded after their entry into force and, in any event, to contracts in operation by 1 January 1994 at the latest.\nNational legislation\n\n8.\n    In the United Kingdom, the Directive was implemented by the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations 1993, which entered into force on 1 January 1994 ('the Regulations‘).\n9.\n    Regulation 1(2) and (3) provides:\n'2.    These Regulations govern the relations between commercial agents and their principals and, subject to paragraph 3, apply in relation to the activities of commercial agents in Great Britain.\n\n3.    Regulations 3 to 22 do not apply where the parties have agreed that the agency contract is to be governed by the law of another Member State.‘\n\nThe main proceedings\n\n10.\n    In 1989, Ingmar and Eaton concluded a contract under which Ingmar was appointed as Eaton's commercial agent in the United Kingdom. A clause of the contract stipulated that the contract was governed by the law of the State of California.\n11.\n    The contract was terminated in 1996. Ingmar instituted proceedings before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, seeking payment of commission and, pursuant to Regulation 17, compensation for damage suffered as a result of the termination of its relations with Eaton.\n12.\n    By judgment of 23 October 1997, the High Court held that the Regulations did not apply, since the contract was governed by the law of the State of California.\n13.\n    Ingmar appealed against that judgment to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division), which decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n'Under English law, effect will be given to the applicable law as chosen by the parties, unless there is a public policy reason, such as an overriding provision, for not so doing. In such circumstances, are the provisions of Council Directive 86/653/EEC, as implemented in the laws of the Member States, and in particular those provisions relating to the payment of compensation to agents on termination of their agreements with their principals, applicable when:\n\n(a)    a principal appoints an exclusive agent in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for the sale of its products therein; and\n\n(b)    in so far as sales of the products in the United Kingdom are concerned, the agent carries out its activities in the United Kingdom; and\n\n(c)    the principal is a company incorporated in a non-EU State, and in particular in the State of California, USA, and situated there; and\n\n(d)    the express applicable law of the contract between the parties is that of the State of California, USA?‘\n\nThe question referred for preliminary ruling\n\n14.\n    By its question, the national court seeks to ascertain, essentially, whether Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-member country and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\n15.\n    The parties to the main proceedings, the United Kingdom and German Governments and the Commission agree that the freedom of contracting parties to choose the system of law by which they wish their contractual relations to be governed is a basic tenet of private international law and that that freedom is removed only by rules that are mandatory.\n16.\n    However, their submissions differ as to the conditions which a legal rule must satisfy in order to be classified as a mandatory rule for the purposes of private international law.\n17.\n    Eaton contends that such mandatory rules can arise only in extremely limited circumstances and that, in the present case, there is no reason to apply the Directive, which is intended to harmonise the domestic laws of the Member States, to parties established outside the European Union.\n18.\n    Ingmar, the United Kingdom Government and the Commission submit that the question of the territorial scope of the Directive is a question of Community law. In their submission, the objectives pursued by the Directive require that its provisions be applied to all commercial agents established in a Member State, irrespective of the nationality or the place of establishment of their principal.\n19.\n    According to the German Government, in the absence of any express provision in the Directive as regards its territorial scope, it is for the court of a Member State seised of a dispute concerning a commercial agent's entitlement to indemnity or compensation to examine the question whether the applicable national rules are to be regarded as mandatory rules for the purposes of private international law.\n20.\n    In that respect, it should be borne in mind, first, that the Directive is designed to protect commercial agents, as defined in the Directive (Case C-215/97 Bellone v Yokohama [1998] ECR I-2191, paragraph 13).\n21.\n    The purpose of Articles 17 to 19 of the Directive, in particular, is to protect the commercial agent after termination of the contract. The regime established by the Directive for that purpose is mandatory in nature. Article 17 requires Member States to put in place a mechanism for providing reparation to the commercial agent after termination of the contract. Admittedly, that article allows the Member States to choose between indemnification and compensation for damage. However, Articles 17 and 18 prescribe a precise framework within which the Member States may exercise their discretion as to the choice of methods for calculating the indemnity or compensation to be granted.\n22.\n    The mandatory nature of those articles is confirmed by the fact that, under Article 19 of the Directive, the parties may not derogate from them to the detriment of the commercial agent before the contract expires. It is also borne out by the fact that, with regard to the United Kingdom, Article 22 of the Directive provides for the immediate application of the national provisions implementing the Directive to contracts in operation.\n23.\n    Second, it should be borne in mind that, as is apparent from the second recital in the preamble to the Directive, the harmonising measures laid down by the Directive are intended, inter alia, to eliminate restrictions on the carrying-on of the activities of commercial agents, to make the conditions of competition within the Community uniform and to increase the security of commercial transactions (see, to that effect, Bellone, paragraph 17).\n24.\n    The purpose of the regime established in Articles 17 to 19 of the Directive is thus to protect, for all commercial agents, freedom of establishment and the operation of undistorted competition in the internal market. Those provisions must therefore be observed throughout the Community if those Treaty objectives are to be attained.\n25.\n    It must therefore be held that it is essential for the Community legal order that a principal established in a non-member country, whose commercial agent carries on his activity within the Community, cannot evade those provisions by the simple expedient of a choice-of-law clause. The purpose served by the provisions in question requires that they be applied where the situation is closely connected with the Community, in particular where the commercial agent carries on his activity in the territory of a Member State, irrespective of the law by which the parties intended the contract to be governed.\n26.\n    In the light of those considerations, the answer to the question must be that Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-membercountry and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\nCosts\n\n27.\n    The costs incurred by the United Kingdom and German Governments and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.\nOn those grounds,\n\nTHE COURT (Fifth Chamber),\n\nin answer to the question referred to it by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division) by order of 31 July 1998, hereby rules:\n\nArticles 17 and 18 of Council Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-member country and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWathelet\nEdward\nJann\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 November 2000.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.919788555Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Montaza-Claro":{"title":"","content":"**Case C-168/05**\n\n**Elisa María Mostaza Claro**\n\n**v**\n\n**Centro Móvil Milenium SL**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the\n\nAudiencia Provincial de Madrid)\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC – Unfair terms in consumer contracts – Failure to raise the unfair nature of a term during arbitration proceedings – Possibility of raising that objection in the context of an action brought against the arbitration award)\n\nSummary of the Judgment\n\n_Approximation of laws – Unfair terms in consumer contracts – Directive 93/13_\n\n_(Council Directive 93/13, Arts 3(1)(t) and 6(1))_\n\nDirective 93/13, concerning unfair terms in consumer contracts, must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n(see para. 39, operative part)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (First Chamber)\n\n26 October 2006 ([*](#Footnote*))\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC – Unfair terms in consumer contracts – Failure to raise the unfair nature of a term during arbitration proceedings – Possibility of raising that objection in the context of an action brought against the arbitration award)\n\nIn Case C-168/05,\n\nREFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC from the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Spain), made by decision of 15 February 2005, received at the Court on 14 April 2005, in the proceedings\n\n**Elisa María Mostaza Claro**\n\nv\n\n**Centro Móvil Milenium SL**,\n\nTHE COURT (First Chamber),\n\ncomposed of P. Jann, President of the Chamber, K. Lenaerts, E. Juhász, J.N.

Among them, point 1(q) of that annex refers to terms which have the object or effect of ‘excluding or hindering the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy, particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not covered by legal provisions, unduly restricting the evidence available to him or imposing on him a burden of proof which, according to the applicable law, should lie with another party to the contract.’\n\n _National legislation_\n\n7        Under Spanish law, consumers were initially protected against unfair terms by Ley General 26/1984 para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios, of 19 July 1984, _Boletín Oficial del Estado_ (Official State Gazette) (BOE) No 176 of 24 July 1984 (General Law 26/1984 for the protection of consumers and users) (‘Law 26/1984’).\n\n8        Law 26/1984 was amended by Ley 7/1998 sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contratación, of 13 April 1998, BOE No 89 of 14 April 1998 (Law 7/1998 on general contractual conditions) (‘Law 7/1998’), which transposed the Directive into national law.\n\n9        In particular, Law 7/1998 added to Law 26/1984 an Article 10a and a first additional provision.\n\n10      Article 10a(1) of Law 26/1984 provides: ‘[A]ll those terms not individually negotiated which, contrary to the requirement of good faith, cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer, shall be regarded as unfair terms. In any event, the terms listed in the first additional provision to this Law shall be regarded as unfair. …’\n\n11      The first additional provision to Law 26/1984 essentially reproduces the list of terms capable of being regarded as unfair which is annexed to the Directive, stating that that list is merely minimal in nature. According to point 26 of that additional provision, ‘submission to arbitration other than consumer arbitration, except in the case of arbitration bodies established by statutory provision in respect of a specific sector or circumstances’ is to be regarded as unfair.\n\n12      Article 8 of Law 7/1998 provides:\n\n‘1.      General conditions which infringe the provisions of this Law or any other rule ordering or prohibiting certain conduct, to the detriment of a party to the contract, shall automatically be void, save in so far as they make separate provision for cases of breach.\n\n2.      In particular, general terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article 10a and the first additional provision of Law 26/1984 … shall be void.’\n\n13      At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, arbitration proceedings were governed by Ley 36/1988 de Arbitraje, of 5 December 1988, BOE No 293 of 7 December 1988 (Law 36/1998 on arbitration) (‘Law 36/1988’).\n\n14      Article 23(1) of Law 36/1988 provided:\n\n‘An objection to arbitration on the ground that the arbitrators lack objective jurisdiction or on the grounds of the non-existence, nullity or expiry of the arbitration agreement must be raised at the same time as the parties make their initial submissions.’\n\n15      Article 45 of Law 36/1988 was worded as follows:\n\n‘The arbitration award may be annulled only in the following cases:\n\n1.      Where the arbitration agreement is null and void.\n\n…\n\n5.      Where the award is contrary to public policy.’\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred to the Court**\n\n16      On 2 May 2002, a mobile telephone contract was concluded between Móvil and Ms Mostaza Claro. The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any disputes arising from the contract were to be referred for arbitration to the Asociación Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity) (AEADE).\n\n17      As Ms Mostaza Claro did not comply with the minimum subscription period, Móvil initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE. By letter of 25 July 2003, the latter granted Ms Mostaza Claro a period of 10 days in which to refuse arbitration proceedings, stating that, in the event of refusal, she could bring legal proceedings. Ms Mostaza Claro presented arguments on the merits of the dispute, but did not repudiate the arbitration proceedings or claim that the arbitration agreement was void. The arbitration proceedings subsequently took place and the arbitrator found against her.\n\n18      Ms Mostaza Claro contested the arbitration decision delivered by the AEADE before the referring court, submitting that the unfair nature of the arbitration clause meant that the arbitration agreement was null and void.\n\n19      In the order for reference, the Audiencia Provincial (Provincial Court) de Madrid (Spain) states that there is no doubt that the arbitration agreement includes an unfair contractual term and is therefore null and void.\n\n20      However, as Ms Mostaza Claro did not plead that the agreement was invalid in the context of the arbitration proceedings, and in order to interpret the national law in accordance with the Directive, the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘May the protection of consumers under Council Directive 93/13/EEC … require the court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award to determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and to annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the consumer’s detriment, when that issue is raised in the action for annulment but was not raised by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings?’\n\n **Preliminary observations**\n\n21      It is apparent from the documents sent to the Court by the Audiencia Provincial that the latter has established that the arbitration clause contained in the contract concluded between Móvil and Ms Mostaza Claro was unfair.\n\n22      In that respect, it must be recalled that the Court may not rule on the application of general criteria used by the Community legislature in order to define the concept of unfair term to a particular term, which must be considered in the light of the particular circumstances of the case in question (Case C-237/02 _Freiburger Kommunalbauten_ [2004] ECR I-3403, paragraph 22).\n\n23      It is therefore for the national court to decide whether a contractual term such as that at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of the Directive (_Freiburger Kommunalbauten_, paragraph 25).\n\n **The question referred**\n\n24      According to settled case-law, in the absence of relevant Community rules, the detailed procedural rules designed to ensure the protection of the rights which individuals acquire under Community law are a matter for the domestic legal order of each Member State, under the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States, provided that they are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by the Community legal order (principle of effectiveness) (see, inter alia, Case C‑78/98 _Preston and Others_ [2000] ECR I-3201, paragraph 31, and Joined Cases C-392/04 and C-422/04 _i-21 Germany and__Arcor_ [2006] ECR I-0000, paragraph 57).\n\n25      The system of protection introduced by the Directive is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of those terms (Joined Cases C-240/98 to C-244/98 _Océano Grupo__Editorial and Salvat Editores_ [2000] ECR I-4941, paragraph 25).\n\n26      Such an imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier may only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract (_Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 27).\n\n27      It is on the basis of those principles that the Court has ruled that the national court’s power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair constitutes a means both of achieving the result sought by Article 6 of the Directive, namely preventing an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term, and of contributing to achieving the aim of Article 7, since if the court undertakes such an examination, that may act as a deterrent and contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers (_Océano Grupo__Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 28, and Case C-473/00 _Cofidis_ [2002] ECR I-10875, paragraph 32).\n\n28      That power of the national court has been regarded as necessary for ensuring that the consumer enjoys effective protection, in view in particular of the real risk that he is unaware of his rights or encounters difficulties in enforcing them (_Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 26, and _Cofidis_, paragraph 33).\n\n29      The protection which the Directive confers on consumers thus extends to cases in which a consumer who has concluded with a seller or supplier a contract containing an unfair term fails to raise the unfair nature of the term, whether because he is unaware of his rights or because he is deterred from enforcing them on account of the costs which judicial proceedings would involve (_Cofidis_, paragraph 34).\n\n30      Under those circumstances, the result sought by Article 6 of the Directive which, as was recalled at paragraph 27 of this judgment, requires the Member States to ensure that consumers are not bound by unfair terms, could not be achieved if the court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award was unable to determine whether that award was void solely because the consumer did not plead the invalidity of the arbitration agreement in the course of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n31      Such an omission by the consumer could not then, under any circumstances, be compensated for by action on the part of persons not party to the contract. The regime of special protection established by the Directive would be definitively undermined.\n\n32      This is precisely the direction that has been taken by the Spanish legislation. Although not applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings, it is worth pointing out that Ley 60/2003 de Arbitraje, of 23 December 2003, BOE No 309 of 26 December 2003 (Law 60/2003 on Arbitration), no longer requires an objection to the arbitration, in particular on the grounds of the invalidity of the arbitration agreement, to be raised at the same time as the parties make their original claims.\n\n33      Móvil and the German Government submit that, if the national court were allowed to determine whether an arbitration agreement is void where the consumer did not raise such an objection during the arbitration proceedings, this would seriously undermine the effectiveness of arbitration awards.\n\n34      It follows from that argument that it is in the interest of efficient arbitration proceedings that review of arbitration awards should be limited in scope and that annulment of or refusal to recognise an award should be possible only in exceptional circumstances (Case C‑126/97 _Eco Swiss_ [1999] ECR I-3055, paragraph 35).\n\n35      However, the Court has already ruled that, where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with Community rules of this type (see, to that effect, _Eco Swiss_, paragraph 37).\n\n36      The importance of consumer protection has in particular led the Community legislature to lay down, in Article 6(1) of the Directive, that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier ‘shall … not be binding on the consumer’. This is a mandatory provision which, taking into account the weaker position of one of the parties to the contract, aims to replace the formal balance which the latter establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them.\n\n37      Moreover, as the aim of the Directive is to strengthen consumer protection, it constitutes, according to Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life in its territory (see, by analogy, concerning Article 81 EC, _Eco Swiss_, paragraph 36).\n\n38      The nature and importance of the public interest underlying the protection which the Directive confers on consumers justify, moreover, the national court being required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier.\n\n39      Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the question referred must be that the Directive must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n **Costs**\n\n40      Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n**Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](#Footref*) Language of the case: Spanish.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.919788555Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Montaza-Claro-AG":{"title":"","content":"OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL\n\nTIZZANO\n\ndelivered on 27 April 2006 1([1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote1))\n\n**Case C-168/05**\n\n**Elisa María Mostaza Claro**\n\n**v**\n\n**Centro Móvil Milenium SL**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Spain))\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC – Consumer contracts – Arbitration clause – Unfairness – Unlawfulness – Issue not raised in arbitration proceedings – Possibility of raising the issue in an action for annulment of the award)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n1.        By order of 15 February 2005, the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Provincial Court, Madrid, hereinafter ‘Audiencia Provincial’) referred a question to the Court under Article 234 EC for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993, on unfair terms in consumer contracts (hereinafter ‘Directive 93/13’ or simply ‘the Directive’). ([2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote2))\n\n2.        In particular, the Audiencia Provincial seeks to ascertain whether the system of consumer protection established by the Directive requires that a national court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine of its own motion the illegality of an arbitration clause which has been found to be unfair, even if the plea to that effect was not raised in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time by the consumer in the application for annulment.\n\nI –  **Legal framework**\n\nA –    _Community law_\n\nDirective 93/13\n\n3.        In order to ‘facilitate the establishment of the internal market’ and provide ‘more effective protection of the consumer’ within that market (sixth, eighth and tenth recitals in the preamble), the Council approved Directive 93/13 on 5 April 1993.\n\n4.        Under Article 3(1):\n\n‘A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer’.\n\n5.        Article 4(1) provides that:\n\n‘Without prejudice to Article 7, the unfairness of a contractual term shall be assessed, taking into account the nature of the goods or services for which the contract was concluded and by referring, at the time of conclusion of the contract, to all the circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract and to all the other terms of the contract or of another contract on which it is dependent’.\n\n6.        Article 6(1) establishes that:\n\n‘Member States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for under their national law, not be binding on the consumer …’.\n\n7.        Article 7 in turn provides that:\n\n‘1.      Member States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers.\n\n2.      The means referred to in paragraph 1 shall include provisions whereby persons or organisations, having a legitimate interest under national law in protecting consumers, may take action according to the national law concerned before the courts or before competent administrative bodies for a decision as to whether contractual terms drawn up for general use are unfair, so that they can apply appropriate and effective means to prevent the continued use of such terms’.\n\n8.        Finally, it should be noted that the Directive has an annex which contains an indicative list of terms which may be regarded as unfair. The terms listed in the annex include, under (q), terms which have the object or effect of:\n\n‘excluding or hindering the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy, particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not covered by legal provisions, unduly restricting the evidence available to him or imposing on him a burden of proof which, according to the applicable law, should lie with another party to the contract’.\n\nB –    _National law_\n\nThe Spanish provisions on unfair terms\n\n9.        Directive 93/13 was transposed into Spanish law by Law 7 of 13 April 1998 (hereinafter ‘Law 7/1998’). ([3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote3))\n\n10.      Article 8(2) of that Law provides that:\n\n‘… [G]eneral terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article 10a and the first additional provision of Law 26 of 19 July 1984 [hereinafter “Law 26/1984”], ([4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote4)) shall be void’.\n\n11.      The concept of unfair terms is defined in Articles 10 and 10a of Law 26/1984. In addition, point 26 of the first additional provision of that Law specifies that ‘submission to arbitration other than consumer arbitration, except in the case of arbitration bodies established by statutory provision in respect of a specific sector or circumstances’, is to be regarded as unfair.\n\nThe Spanish provisions on arbitration\n\n12.      At the time at which the events in issue occurred, arbitration proceedings were governed by Law 36 of 5 December 1988 (hereinafter ‘Law 36/1988’). ([5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote5))\n\n13.      For the purposes of the present case, particular reference should be made to Article 23 of that Law, which provides that:\n\n‘1.      An objection to the arbitration on the ground that the arbitrators lack objective jurisdiction or on the grounds of the non-existence, nullity or expiry of the arbitration agreement must be raised at the same time as the parties make their initial submissions.\n\n…’.\n\n14.      Attention is also drawn to Article 45, which provides that:\n\n‘The arbitration award may be annulled only in the following cases:\n\n1.      Where the arbitration agreement is null and void.\n\n2.      Where the formalities and essential principles laid down by statute as to the appointment of arbitrators and the conduct of the arbitration proceedings have not been observed.\n\n3.      Where the award was made out of time.\n\n4.      Where the arbitrators have decided issues which had not been submitted to them for decision or where, although those issues were submitted, they cannot be the subject of arbitration … .\n\n5.      Where the award is contrary to public policy’.\n\nII –  **Facts and procedure**\n\n15.      The subject of the main proceedings is a dispute between Ms Mostaza Claro and Centro Móvil Milenium SL (hereinafter ‘Centro Móvil’).\n\n16.      On 2 May 2002, Ms Mostaza Claro concluded a mobile telephone contract (hereinafter ‘the contract’) with Centro Móvil which specified a minimum subscription period. The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any disputes arising from the contract were to be referred for settlement by an arbitrator designated by the Asociación Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity, hereinafter ‘AEADE’).\n\n17.      On establishing that the minimum subscription period had not been completed, Centro Móvil initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE, which granted Ms Mostaza Claro a period of 10 days in which to decide whether to refuse arbitration or to file submissions and present evidence to the arbitrator in support of her position. Ms Mostaza Claro put forward a number of arguments in her defence within the allotted time but did not claim that the arbitration clause was void.\n\n18.      The arbitrator concluded that Ms Mostaza Claro’s arguments were unfounded and accordingly gave a decision on 22 September 2003 awarding Centro Móvil compensation for the damage which it had suffered and reimbursement of the costs incurred in the proceedings.\n\n19.      Ms Mostaza Claro challenged that decision before the Audiencia Provincial. Before that court, the applicant claimed for the first time that the arbitration clause was unfair and that the award should consequently be annulled. Centro Móvil opposed the application, arguing that, under Article 23 of Law 36/1988, the claim that the clause was void ought to have been raised in the arbitration proceedings and could not therefore be taken into consideration in the judicial proceedings for annulment of the award.\n\n20.      The Audiencia Provincial found that, under Law 26/1984 (Articles 10, 10a and the first additional provision) and Law 7/1998 (Article 8), the arbitration clause included in the contract was unfair. However, in the absence of a specific challenge by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings, it doubted whether it could of its own motion declare that the clause was void.\n\n21.      On those grounds, the Audiencia Provincial referred the following question to the Court:\n\n‘May the protection of consumers under Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts require the court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award to determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and to annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the consumer’s detriment, when that issue is raised in the action for annulment but was not raised by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings?’\n\n22.      In the proceedings thus instituted, written observations have been submitted by Centro Móvil, the Spanish, German, Hungarian and Finnish Governments, and the Commission.\n\nIII –  **Legal analysis**\n\n_Introduction: the question of the unfair nature of the arbitration clause at issue in the main proceedings_\n\n23.      Before taking a position on the question referred to the Court, the parties which submitted written observations first spent a significant period of time considering a preliminary question, namely whether the arbitration clause at issue in the main proceedings really is an unfair term, that is to say, ‘a contractual term which has not been individually negotiated’ and which, ‘contrary to the requirement of good faith, … causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer’ (Article 3(1) of the Directive).\n\n24.      Centro Móvil takes the view that the existence of a term prohibited by Directive 93/13 can be excluded in the present case inasmuch as, having entered into the telephone subscription contract in the context of her own professional activity, Ms Mostaza Claro could not be regarded as a ‘consumer’. It also claims that the clause in question was individually negotiated with the applicant and consequently did not come within the ambit of Article 3.\n\n25.      The Hungarian Government, by contrast, considers that it is not clear from the order for reference whether the clause in question satisfies the requirements laid down in Directive 93/13. It adds that, in any event, the Directive does not require Member States to regard as unfair all terms of consumer contracts which provide legally recognised alternative means of settling disputes.\n\n26.      The position of the Finnish Government and the Commission is different again. In their view, the clause at issue in the main proceedings undoubtedly satisfies the requirements laid down in the abovementioned Article 3. In particular, according to the Finnish Government, it causes a significant contractual imbalance to the detriment of the consumer, who as a rule does not have the necessary legal expertise to assess the implications arising from the inclusion of an arbitration clause in the contract. The Finnish Government and the Commission add that the clause is among those figuring on the indicative list in the annex to the Directive, notably under (q), which refers to terms which have ‘the object or effect of … excluding or hindering the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy’.\n\n27.      For my part, I am inclined rather to share the view taken by the Commission and the Finnish Government on this issue. Apart from that, however, it seems to me that there is another question that ought to be asked at this point.\n\n28.      As we know, in the context of its jurisdiction under Article 234 EC to interpret Community law, the Court may indeed ‘interpret general criteria used by the Community legislature in order to define the concept of unfair terms’. However, it may not ‘rule on the application of these general criteria to a particular term’, which, under Article 4 of the Directive, must be considered in the light of all the circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract in ‘the case in question’, circumstances of which the national court alone has direct knowledge. ([6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote6))\n\n29.      In the division of functions provided for by the Treaty, it is for the national court, which alone has direct knowledge of those circumstances, ‘to decide whether [the] contractual term … at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of the Directive’. ([7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote7))\n\n30.      Nor can any different conclusion be drawn from the case of _Océano Grupo Editorial_, ([8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote8)) in which however – as the Commission has pointed out – the Court made that assessment. In its subsequent judgment in _Freiburger Kommunalbauten_, ([9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote9)) the Court explained that the aforementioned case represents a precedent that is most exceptional and is therefore not generally applicable.\n\n31.      According to the Court, the main proceedings in _Océano Grupo Editorial_ concerned a jurisdiction clause which conferred ‘jurisdiction in respect of all disputes arising under the contract on the court in the territorial jurisdiction of which the seller [had] his principal place of business’. The term in question was thus ‘solely to the benefit of the seller and contained no benefit in return for the consumer’ and was therefore quite patently unfair. That was the only ground on which it was possible for the Court to hold that the term was unfair ‘without having to consider all the circumstances in which the contract was concluded’. ([10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote10))\n\n32.      In most cases, however, it will not be clear that the term is unfair and it is therefore for the national court to determine whether the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of the Directive apply in those cases.\n\n33.      In the present case, the referring court did in fact consider whether the arbitration clause in question was unfair. In its order for reference, the Audiencia Provincial held that ‘there is no doubt that the arbitration agreement included in the promotional contract for a mobile telephone concluded between Ms Mostaza Claro and Centro Móvil Milenium is tainted with invalidity on account of its containing an unfair term’ within the meaning of the national law transposing Directive 93/13.\n\n34.      In that situation, I therefore consider that the Court can do no more than take note of that assessment. Especially, I should add, as the referring court has not in fact asked about the nature of the term but only whether it can declare of its own motion that the term is unlawful.\n\n35.      It should be noted that, in accordance with settled case-law, under the Treaty attribution of areas of competence, it is for the national court to determine the questions which are relevant for the purpose of settling the dispute in the main proceedings and the questions on which the Court is in principle required to rule. ([11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote11))\n\n36.      Only exceptionally, and in so far as it is necessary in order to give an answer which will be ‘useful to the national court’, may the Court modify the questions and/or examine new questions. ([12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote12)) However, no one has claimed, nor does it appear from the documents in the case, that circumstances of this kind obtain in the present case.\n\n37.      I therefore conclude that in the present case it is necessary to concur with the assessment of the national court, which found that the term at issue in the main proceedings is unfair. I therefore propose to examine the question posited in the light of that finding.\n\n_The question_\n\n38.      As we have seen, by its single question, the national court seeks to ascertain whether the system for the protection of consumers established by the Directive requires that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine of its own motion that an arbitration clause which has been found to be unfair is void and consequently to annul the award, even if the consumer did not enter a plea to that effect in the course of the arbitration proceedings and did so for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\n39.      In this connection, I agree with the Spanish, Hungarian and Finnish Governments and the Commission that, in the light of the case-law of the Court, that question can be answered in the affirmative.\n\n40.      Indeed, the Court has already recognised that national courts may determine of their own motion, in cases where the seller or supplier seeks enforcement of a contract, that unfair terms in contracts are unlawful.\n\n41.      In the judgment in _Océano Grupo Editorial_,  ([13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote13)) cited above, the Court pointed out that Article 7(2) of the Directive allows authorised consumer associations to take action in order to obtain a decision as to whether terms drawn up for general use are unfair and, if need be, to have them prohibited, even if they have not been used in specific contracts. The reason for this, according to the Court, is that that provision is part of a system of protection ‘based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge’ and that such a situation ‘may only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract’. ([14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote14))\n\n42.      According to the Court, in a system that allows actions of this kind, ‘it is hardly conceivable that … a court hearing a dispute on a specific contract containing an unfair term should not be able to set aside application of the relevant term solely because the consumer has not raised the fact that it is unfair’. ([15](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote15)) Conversely, it is consistent with such a system to allow positive action by the national court in the form of a determination of its own motion that the term is unlawful and, if need be, non‑application of the term in question.\n\n43.      The Court subsequently added, in the judgment in _Cofidis_, that courts must be accorded the power to determine the illegality of an unfair term even if the consumer fails to raise the unfair nature of the term within the time-limit fixed under national law. ([16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote16))\n\n44.      In this connection, the Court pointed out that the protection provided for consumers under Directive 93/13 was intended to be ‘effective protection’ and to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers (Article 7) and to prevent an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term in a contract (Article 6). ([17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote17))\n\n45.      According to the Court, the effectiveness of that protection is liable to be adversely affected, in proceedings brought by sellers or suppliers, by ‘the real risk that [the consumer] is unaware of his rights’ or is deterred ‘from enforcing them on account of the costs which judicial proceedings would involve’. To prevent that risk, the power in question must therefore also extend, at least in proceedings brought by sellers or suppliers, to ‘cases in which a consumer … fails to raise the unfair nature’ of the term in the contract before the ‘expiry of a limitation period’ fixed by the national legislature. ([18](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote18))\n\n46.      Centro Móvil and the German Government, however, contend that the abovementioned considerations do not apply in the present case. In this case, the risk that the protection of the consumer might be adversely affected is precluded by the fact that Ms Mostaza Claro was at liberty, under the arbitration clause, to refuse arbitration and, under Article 23 of Law 36/1988, to argue that the clause in question was void in the initial statement of defence submitted to the arbitrator.\n\n47.      I note, however, that in the present case, just as in _Cofidis_, there was a real risk (which in fact materialised) that in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the seller, the consumer might fail to exercise that power out of ignorance or fear of the costs of an action before the ordinary judicial authorities, which she would have to meet once the arbitration agreement had been rejected or declared void.\n\n48.      Not only that, but the time she was given to choose between availing herself of that option or abandoning hope of reaching a speedier and less costly resolution of the dispute was so short as to render it excessively difficult, if not impossible, for her to exercise the choice in question. It is apparent from the order for reference that, under the arbitration clause drafted by Centro Móvil, all disputes arising under the contract were to be submitted to an arbitration body (AEADE) which granted Ms Mostaza Claro a period of only 10 days in which to refuse arbitration or, if she did not refuse arbitration, to file submissions and present evidence in her defence.\n\n49.      Thus, contrary to what Centro Móvil and the German Government contend, the consumer’s right to a fair hearing appears to be severely limited under that procedure.\n\n50.      Centro Móvil and the German Government, however, also raise a different material objection to extending the findings in _Océano Grupo Editorial_ and _Cofidis_ to the present case. In their view, to allow the court hearing the action for annulment to determine the illegality of the arbitration clause even if no plea to that effect was entered within the prescribed time-limit would be highly prejudicial to the requirement of efficiency and certainty in arbitration decisions. That was, however, a requirement that the Spanish legislation was designed to preserve, specifically by fixing procedural limits for claims relating to the arbitration clause and by restricting the cases in which the award could be annulled to those contained in an exhaustive list (Articles 23 and 45 of Law 36/1988).\n\n51.      It is undoubtedly in the interest of ‘efficient arbitration proceedings’ that ‘review of arbitration awards’ should be limited in scope. ([19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote19)) As Centro Móvil and the German Government have rightly pointed out, that requirement is reflected in numerous procedural rules and various international instruments ([20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote20)) which identify a specific number of cases in which ‘annulment of or refusal to recognise an award’ is possible. ([21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote21))\n\n52.      However, it does not seem to me that there is any risk of that requirement being subverted in the present case. The Spanish legislation, like most of the national legislation and international instruments on the subject, ([22](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote22)) includes among the cases in which an award may be annulled those where the award is contrary to public policy (Article 45(5) of Law 36/1988), irrespective of any challenge by the parties.\n\n53.      Moreover, the Court held in the celebrated judgment in _Eco Swiss_ that ‘where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with’ similar Community rules. ([23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote23))\n\n54.      The Court held in that case that such rules include Article 81 EC, which in its view is to be regarded as a matter of public policy inasmuch as it constitutes a ‘fundamental’ provision which is ‘essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market’. ([24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote24))\n\n55.      On the basis of that precedent, and in view of the importance attached to consumer protection in the Community legal order, the Commission considers that the provisions of Directive 93/13 can also be regarded as rules of public policy. In its view, the provisions in question are harmonising provisions approved for the purpose of providing more efficient protection for the consumer within the internal market. They are thus important provisions designed to contribute to ‘the strengthening of consumer protection’, a task mentioned in Article 3(1)(t) EC as one of the fundamental activities of the Community. The national courts are consequently required to ensure that those provisions are respected in actions for annulment of arbitration awards, even where – as in the present case – the failure to comply with the provisions has not been challenged in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n56.      I would not in principle here preclude the possibility that that may be a legitimate approach in this case. However, I fear that it is open to the objection that it might give excessively wide scope to a concept, namely that of public policy, which traditionally refers only to rules that are regarded as being of primary and absolute importance in a legal order.\n\n57.      In any event, it does not seem to me that the path proposed by the Commission is the only possible way of enabling a court to determine of its own motion the illegality of an award in proceedings for annulment. I consider, in fact, that in line with the general direction of Community case-law and the precedents cited above, the Court should be permitted to make that determination in the present case because it is a matter of ensuring observance of a fundamental principle of the legal order, namely the right to a fair hearing.\n\n58.      As we saw earlier (see point 48 et seq.), it is precisely and principally that right which is seriously compromised by the term at issue in the present case.\n\n59.      According to the settled case-law of the Court, the right to be heard must be guaranteed ‘in all proceedings initiated against a person which are liable to culminate in a measure adversely affecting that person’, ([25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote25)) thus also in arbitration proceedings. Observance of that right is ‘a fundamental principle of Community law’ and it is ‘one of the fundamental rights deriving from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States’. ([26](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote26))\n\n60.      On that ground, it can therefore indeed be said that we have here a principle that forms part of the concept of Community public policy as adopted by the Court.\n\n61.      This is confirmed, moreover, by the judgment in _Krombach_, in which the Court was asked to interpret Article 27, point 1, of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters. ([27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote27)) Under that provision, the courts of a Contracting State (the State in which enforcement is sought) may refuse to recognise a judgment delivered in another Contracting State (the State of origin) if such recognition is ‘contrary to public policy’. The Court, having noted that observance of the right to be defended occupies a prominent position in the Community legal order, accordingly held that recourse to the ‘public-policy’ clause in the Convention must be permitted, since in that particular case the guarantees laid down in the legislation of the State of origin ‘[had] been insufficient to protect the defendant from a manifest breach of his right to defend himself’. ([28](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote28))\n\n62.      In the light of the considerations set out above, I therefore take the view that the system for the protection of consumers established by Directive 93/13 requires that, in a case such as the present one, a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine that an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul the award on the ground that it is contrary to public policy, even if that defect was not contested by the consumer in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\nIV –  **Conclusion**\n\n63.      In the light of the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court give the following answer to the question referred by the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid:\n\nThe system for the protection of consumers established by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts requires that, in a case such as the present one, a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine that an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul the award on the ground that it is contrary to public policy, even if that defect was not contested by the consumer in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\n---\n\n[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref1) – Original language: Italian.\n\n---\n\n[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref2) – OJ 1993 L 95, p. 29.\n\n---\n\n[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref3) – Ley 7/1998, Sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contratación (Law 7/1998 of 13 April 1998 on general contractual conditions) (_Boletín Oficial del Estado_ (Official State Gazette) (‘BOE’) No 89 of 14 April 1998, p. 12304).\n\n---\n\n[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref4) –      Ley 26/1984, General para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios (Law 26/1984 of 19 July 1984 for the protection of consumers and users) (BOE No 176 of 24 July 1984, p. 21686).\n\n---\n\n[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref5) – Ley 36/1988 de Arbitraje (Law 36/1988 of 5 December 1988 on arbitration) (BOE No 293 of 7 December 1988, p. 34605).\n\n---\n\n[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref6) – Judgment in Case C-237/02 _Freiburger Kommunalbauten_ [2004] ECR I-3403, paragraph 22.

It should be borne in mind in that regard that Regulation No 44/2001, apart from a few limited exceptions, does not authorise the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to be reviewed by a court in another Member State.\n\nSecondly, in obstructing the court of another Member State in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001, namely to decide, on the basis of the rules defining the material scope of that regulation, including Article 1(2)(d) thereof, whether that regulation is applicable, such an anti-suit injunction also runs counter to the trust which the Member States accord to one another’s legal systems and judicial institutions and on which the system of jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001 is based.\n\nLastly, if, by means of an anti-suit injunction, the national court were prevented from examining itself the preliminary issue of the validity or the applicability of the arbitration agreement, a party could avoid the proceedings merely by relying on that agreement and the applicant, which considers that the agreement is void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, would thus be barred from access to the court before which it brought proceedings under Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 and would therefore be deprived of a form of judicial protection to which it is entitled.\n\nThis finding is supported by Article II(3) of The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on 10 June 1958, according to which it is the court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an arbitration agreement, that will, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n\n(see paras 26-31, 33-34, operative part)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber)\n\n10 February 2009 ([*](#Footnote*))\n\n(Recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards – Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 – Scope of application – Jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to issue an order restraining a party from commencing or continuing proceedings before a court of another Member State on the ground that those proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement – New York Convention)\n\nIn Case C‑185/07,\n\nREFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Articles 68 EC and 234 EC from the House of Lords (United Kingdom), made by decision of 28 March 2007, received at the Court on 2 April 2007, in the proceedings\n\n**Allianz SpA**, formerly Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà SpA,\n\n**Generali Assicurazioni Generali SpA**,\n\nv\n\n**West Tankers Inc.**,\n\nTHE COURT (Grand Chamber),\n\ncomposed of V.

(‘West Tankers’) concerning West Tankers’ liability in tort.\n\n **Legal context**\n\n _International law_\n\n3        The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on 10 June 1958 (_United Nations Treaty Series_, Vol. 330, p. 3) (‘the New York Convention’), provides as follows in Article II(3):\n\n‘The court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.’\n\n _Community law_\n\n4        According to recital 25 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001:\n\n‘Respect for international commitments entered into by the Member States means that this Regulation should not affect conventions relating to specific matters to which the Member States are parties.’\n\n5        Article 1(1) and (2) of that regulation provides:\n\n‘1.      This Regulation shall apply in civil and commercial matters whatever the nature of the court or tribunal. It shall not extend, in particular, to revenue, customs or administrative matters.\n\n2.      The Regulation shall not apply to:\n\n…\n\n(d)      arbitration.’\n\n6        Article 5 of that regulation provides:\n\n‘A person domiciled in a Member State may, in another Member State, be sued:\n\n…\n\n(3)      in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur;\n\n…’.\n\n _National law_\n\n7        Section 37(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 provides:\n\n‘The High Court may by order (whether interlocutory or final) grant an injunction … in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just and convenient to do so.’\n\n8        Section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996, entitled ‘Court powers exercisable in support of arbitral proceedings’, provides:\n\n‘(1)      Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the court has for the purposes of and in relation to arbitral proceedings the same power of making orders about the matters listed below as it has for the purposes of and in relation to legal proceedings.\n\n(2)      Those matters are:\n\n…\n\n(e)      the granting of an interim injunction …’.\n\n **The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n9        In August 2000 the _Front Comor_, a vessel owned by West Tankers and chartered by Erg Petroli SpA (‘Erg’), collided in Syracuse (Italy) with a jetty owned by Erg and caused damage. The charterparty was governed by English law and contained a clause providing for arbitration in London (United Kingdom).\n\n10      Erg claimed compensation from its insurers Allianz and Generali up to the limit of its insurance cover and commenced arbitration proceedings in London against West Tankers for the excess. West Tankers denied liability for the damage caused by the collision.\n\n11      Having paid Erg compensation under the insurance policies for the loss it had suffered, Allianz and Generali brought proceedings on 30 July 2003 against West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa (Italy) in order to recover the sums they had paid to Erg. The action was based on their statutory right of subrogation to Erg’s claims, in accordance with Article 1916 of the Italian Civil Code. West Tankers raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction on the basis of the existence of the arbitration agreement.\n\n12      In parallel, West Tankers brought proceedings, on 10 September 2004, before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court), seeking a declaration that the dispute between itself, on the one hand, and Allianz and Generali, on the other, was to be settled by arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement. West Tankers also sought an injunction restraining Allianz and Generali from pursuing any proceedings other than arbitration and requiring them to discontinue the proceedings commenced before the Tribunale di Siracusa (‘the anti-suit injunction’).\n\n13      By judgment of 21 March 2005, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court), upheld West Tankers’ claims and granted the anti-suit injunction sought against Allianz and Generali. The latter appealed against that judgment to the House of Lords. They argued that the grant of such an injunction is contrary to Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n14      The House of Lords first referred to the judgments in Case C-116/02 _Gasser_ [2003] ECR I-14693 and Case C-159/02 _Turner_ [2004] ECR I‑3565, which decided in substance that an injunction restraining a party from commencing or continuing proceedings in a court of a Member State cannot be compatible with the system established by Regulation No 44/2001, even where it is granted by the court having jurisdiction under that regulation. That is because the regulation provides a complete set of uniform rules on the allocation of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States which must trust each other to apply those rules correctly.\n\n15      However, that principle cannot, in the view of the House of Lords, be extended to arbitration, which is completely excluded from the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 by virtue of Article 1(2)(d) thereof. In that field, there is no set of uniform Community rules, which is a necessary condition in order that mutual trust between the courts of the Member States may be established and applied. Moreover, it is clear from the judgment in Case C-190/89 _Rich_ [1991] ECR I‑3855 that the exclusion in Article 1(2)(d) of Regulation No 44/2001 applies not only to arbitration proceedings as such, but also to legal proceedings the subject-matter of which is arbitration. The judgment in Case C-391/95 _Van Uden_ [1998] ECR I-7091 stated that arbitration is the subject-matter of proceedings where they serve to protect the right to determine the dispute by arbitration, which is the case in the main proceedings.\n\n16      The House of Lords adds that since all arbitration matters fall outside the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, an injunction addressed to Allianz and Generali restraining them from having recourse to proceedings other than arbitration and from continuing proceedings before the Tribunale di Siracusa cannot infringe the regulation.\n\n17      Finally, the House of Lords points out that the courts of the United Kingdom have for many years used anti-suit injunctions. That practice is, in its view, a valuable tool for the court of the seat of arbitration, exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, as it promotes legal certainty and reduces the possibility of conflict between the arbitration award and the judgment of a national court. Furthermore, if the practice were also adopted by the courts in other Member States it would make the European Community more competitive vis-à-vis international arbitration centres such as New York, Bermuda and Singapore.\n\n18      In those circumstances, the House of Lords decided to stay its proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‘Is it consistent with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings in another Member State on the ground that such proceedings are in breach of an arbitration agreement?’\n\n **The question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n19      By its question, the House of Lords asks, essentially, whether it is incompatible with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State on the ground that such proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement, even though Article 1(2)(d) of the regulation excludes arbitration from the scope thereof.\n\n20      An anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, may be directed against actual or potential claimants in proceedings abroad. As observed by the Advocate General in point 14 of her Opinion, non-compliance with an anti-suit injunction is contempt of court, for which penalties can be imposed, including imprisonment or seizure of assets.\n\n21      Both West Tankers and the United Kingdom Government submit that such an injunction is not incompatible with Regulation No 44/2001 because Article 1(2)(d) thereof excludes arbitration from its scope of application.\n\n22      In that regard it must be borne in mind that, in order to determine whether a dispute falls within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, reference must be made solely to the subject-matter of the proceedings (_Rich_, paragraph 26). More specifically, its place in the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 is determined by the nature of the rights which the proceedings in question serve to protect (_Van Uden_, paragraph 33).\n\n23      Proceedings, such as those in the main proceedings, which lead to the making of an anti-suit injunction, cannot, therefore, come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n24      However, even though proceedings do not come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, they may nevertheless have consequences which undermine its effectiveness, namely preventing the attainment of the objectives of unification of the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and the free movement of decisions in those matters. This is so, inter alia, where such proceedings prevent a court of another Member State from exercising the jurisdiction conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n25      It is therefore appropriate to consider whether the proceedings brought by Allianz and Generali against West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa themselves come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 and then to ascertain the effects of the anti-suit injunction on those proceedings.\n\n26      In that regard, the Court finds, as noted by the Advocate General in points 53 and 54 of her Opinion, that, if, because of the subject-matter of the dispute, that is, the nature of the rights to be protected in proceedings, such as a claim for damages, those proceedings come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, a preliminary issue concerning the applicability of an arbitration agreement, including in particular its validity, also comes within its scope of application. This finding is supported by paragraph 35 of the Report on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (OJ 1978 L 304, p. 36) (‘the Brussels Convention’), presented by Messrs Evrigenis and Kerameus (OJ 1986 C 298, p. 1). That paragraph states that the verification, as an incidental question, of the validity of an arbitration agreement which is cited by a litigant in order to contest the jurisdiction of the court before which he is being sued pursuant to the Brussels Convention, must be considered as falling within its scope.\n\n27      It follows that the objection of lack of jurisdiction raised by West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa on the basis of the existence of an arbitration agreement, including the question of the validity of that agreement, comes within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 and that it is therefore exclusively for that court to rule on that objection and on its own jurisdiction, pursuant to Articles 1(2)(d) and 5(3) of that regulation.\n\n28      Accordingly, the use of an anti-suit injunction to prevent a court of a Member State, which normally has jurisdiction to resolve a dispute under Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001, from ruling, in accordance with Article 1(2)(d) of that regulation, on the very applicability of the regulation to the dispute brought before it necessarily amounts to stripping that court of the power to rule on its own jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n29      It follows, first, as noted by the Advocate General in point 57 of her Opinion, that an anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, is contrary to the general principle which emerges from the case-law of the Court on the Brussels Convention, that every court seised itself determines, under the rules applicable to it, whether it has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute before it (see, to that effect, _Gasser_, paragraphs 48 and 49). It should be borne in mind in that regard that Regulation No 44/2001, apart from a few limited exceptions which are not relevant to the main proceedings, does not authorise the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to be reviewed by a court in another Member State (Case C‑351/89 _Overseas Union Insurance and Others_ [1991] ECR I-3317, paragraph 24, and _Turner_, paragraph 26). That jurisdiction is determined directly by the rules laid down by that regulation, including those relating to its scope of application. Thus in no case is a court of one Member State in a better position to determine whether the court of another Member State has jurisdiction (_Overseas__Union Insurance and Others_, paragraph 23, and _Gasser_, paragraph 48).\n\n30      Further, in obstructing the court of another Member State in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001, namely to decide, on the basis of the rules defining the material scope of that regulation, including Article 1(2)(d) thereof, whether that regulation is applicable, such an anti-suit injunction also runs counter to the trust which the Member States accord to one another’s legal systems and judicial institutions and on which the system of jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001 is based (see, to that effect, _Turner_, paragraph 24).\n\n31      Lastly, if, by means of an anti-suit injunction, the Tribunale di Siracusa were prevented from examining itself the preliminary issue of the validity or the applicability of the arbitration agreement, a party could avoid the proceedings merely by relying on that agreement and the applicant, which considers that the agreement is void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, would thus be barred from access to the court before which it brought proceedings under Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 and would therefore be deprived of a form of judicial protection to which it is entitled.\n\n32      Consequently, an anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, is not compatible with Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n33      This finding is supported by Article II(3) of the New York Convention, according to which it is the court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an arbitration agreement, that will, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n\n34      In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that it is incompatible with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State on the ground that such proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement.\n\n **Costs**\n\n35      Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.

An example, with descriptions for each setting, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/config.yaml).\n\n### Code Block Titles\nTo add code block titles with Amethyst:\n\n1. Ensure that code block titles are enabled in the configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Amethyst's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`. The default configuration, with descriptions, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/data/graphConfig.yaml).\n\n### Language Support\n[Chinese, Japanese, and Korean support](features/language.md) comes out of the box with Amethyst.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Amethyst) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.yaml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ndefaultContentLanguage: ar\nlanguages:\n  ar:\n    languagedirection: rtl\n    title: مدونتي\n    weight: 2\n```\n\n# Custom Styles\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling in `assets/_custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Changing the Color Scheme\nThe default color schemes for light mode and dark mode are located in `assets/_colors.scss`. You can replace the values for existing color variables for drop-in edits, or create new variables to reference in `_custom.scss`.\n\n### Changing the Fonts\nAll fonts are defined in `assets/_fonts.scss`. There are examples for both local fonts (defined using `@font-face`) and webfonts (fetched with `@import` from a font distributor such as Google Fonts).\n\nYou can place all local fonts in the `static/fonts` folder.\n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any subfolder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question.

Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file in the front matter like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\nYou can specify additional params in the front matter of individual pages:\n\n```toml\n# Set type to 'docs' if you want to render page outside of configured section or if you render section other than 'docs'\ntype = 'docs'\n\n# Set page weight to re-arrange items in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)\nweight = 10\n\n# (Optional) Set to 'true' to mark page as flat section in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)\nbookFlatSection = false\n\n# (Optional) Set to hide nested sections or pages at that level.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Amethyst.\n\n### Does Amethyst have Latex support?\nYes! See [LaTeX](features/latex.md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Amethyst?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Amethyst.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from the `deploy` branch (and not `main`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/setup/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Amethyst by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root folder (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Amethyst makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](setup/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](setup/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](setup/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](setup/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](setup/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](setup/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/setup/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/setup/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Amethyst needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](setup/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Amethyst is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nAmethyst isn't perfect!

Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n```\n\nOr, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want to force update your local garden (this assumed that you are okay with some of your personalizations been overriden!)\n\n```shell\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning!\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Amethyst as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:64bitpandas/amethyst.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T15:01:59.927788623Z","tags":null}}
