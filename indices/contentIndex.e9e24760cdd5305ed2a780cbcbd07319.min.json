In accordance with Article¬†3(1) of the BIT, the contracting parties undertook to ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other contracting party and not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of those investments. In accordance with Article¬†4 of the BIT, each contracting party guaranteed the free transfer in a freely convertible currency without undue restriction or delay of payments relating to an investment, such as profits, interest and dividends.\n\n4\n\nArticle¬†8 of the BIT provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if, possible, be settled amicably.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph¬†1 of this Article to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph¬†2 of this Article will be constituted for each individual case in the following way: each party to the dispute appoints one member of the tribunal and the two members thus appointed shall select a national of a third State as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute shall appoint its member of the tribunal within two months, and the Chairman shall be appointed within three months from the date on which the investor has notified the other Contracting Party of his decision to submit the dispute to the arbitral tribunal.\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†If the appointments have not been made in the abovementioned periods, either party to the dispute may invite the President of the Arbitration Institute of the Chamber of Commerce of Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the most senior member of the Arbitration Institute who is not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules.\n\n6.¬†¬†¬†The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n‚Äì\n\nthe law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n‚Äì\n\nthe provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n‚Äì\n\nthe provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n‚Äì\n\nthe general principles of international law.\n\n7.¬†¬†¬†The tribunal takes its decision by majority of votes; such decision shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.‚Äô\n\nGerman law\n\n5\n\nUnder Paragraph¬†1059(2) of the Zivilprozessordnung (Code of Civil Procedure), an arbitral award can be set aside only if one of the grounds set out in that provision is present, which include the arbitration agreement being invalid under the law to which the parties have subjected it, and the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award being contrary to public policy.\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n6\n\nOn 1¬†January 1993 the Slovak Republic, as a successor State to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, succeeded to the rights and obligations of that State under the BIT, and on 1¬†May 2004 it acceded to the European Union.\n\n7\n\nAs part of a reform of its health system, the Slovak Republic opened the Slovak market in 2004 to national operators and those of other Member States offering private sickness insurance services. Achmea, an undertaking belonging to a Netherlands insurance group, after obtaining authorisation as a sickness insurance institution, set up a subsidiary in Slovakia to which it contributed capital and through which it offered private sickness insurance services on the Slovak market.\n\n8\n\nIn 2006 the Slovak Republic partly reversed the liberalisation of the private sickness insurance market. In particular, by a law of 25¬†October 2007, it prohibited the distribution of profits generated by private sickness insurance activities. Subsequently, after the √östavn√Ω s√∫d Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic) held in a judgment of 26¬†January 2011 that the prohibition was contrary to the Slovak constitution, the Slovak Republic, by a law which entered into force on 1¬†August 2011, once more allowed the distribution of the profits in question.\n\n9\n\nSince it considered that the legislative measures of the Slovak Republic had caused it damage, Achmea brought arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic in October 2008 pursuant to Article¬†8 of the BIT.\n\n10\n\nAs Frankfurt am Main (Germany) was chosen as the place of arbitration, German law applies to the arbitration proceedings concerned.\n\n11\n\nIn those arbitration proceedings the Slovak Republic raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. It submitted in that respect that, as a result of its accession to the European Union, recourse to an arbitral tribunal provided for in Article¬†8(2) of the BIT was incompatible with EU law. By an interlocutory arbitral award of 26¬†October 2010, the arbitral tribunal dismissed the objection. The applications for that award to be set aside brought by the Slovak Republic before the German courts were unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal.\n\n12\n\nBy arbitral award of 7¬†December 2012, the arbitral tribunal ordered the Slovak Republic to pay Achmea damages in the principal amount of EUR¬†22.1¬†million. The Slovak Republic brought an action to set aside that arbitral award before the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (Higher Regional Court, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). When that court dismissed the action, the Slovak Republic appealed on a point of law against the dismissal to the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany).\n\n13\n\nThe referring court notes that, since the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1¬†May 2004, the BIT has constituted an agreement between Member States, so that in the event of conflict the provisions of EU law take precedence, in the matters governed by them, over the provisions of the BIT.\n\n14\n\nThe Slovak Republic expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the arbitration clause in Article¬†8 of the BIT with Articles¬†18, 267 and¬†344 TFEU. Although the referring court does not share those doubts, it nonetheless considered that, since the Court has not yet ruled on those questions and the questions are of considerable importance because of the numerous bilateral investment treaties still in force between Member States which contain similar arbitration clauses, it was necessary to make the present reference to the Court in order to decide the case before it.\n\n15\n\nIn the first place, the referring court doubts that Article¬†344 TFEU is even applicable. To begin with, the subject matter and purpose of that provision show that, even if its wording does not make this clearly apparent, it does not concern disputes between an individual and a Member State.\n\n16\n\nNext, the subject matter of Article¬†344 TFEU is confined to disputes relating to the interpretation and application of the Treaties. The dispute in the main proceedings is not such a case, however, as the arbitral award of 7¬†December 2012 was made on the basis of the BIT alone.\n\n17\n\nFinally, the purpose of Article¬†344 TFEU is to safeguard the allocation of powers laid down by the Treaties, and hence the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court, and at the same time it is a specific manifestation of the duty of the Member States to cooperate with the Court within the meaning of Article¬†4(3) TEU. It cannot, however, be concluded from that that Article¬†344 TFEU safeguards the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to any dispute in which EU law may be applied or interpreted. That provision in fact protects the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court only to the extent that the Member States have to make use of the procedures before the Court laid down by the Treaties. Yet a dispute such as that in the main proceedings cannot be resolved in proceedings before the EU judicature. The Treaties make no provision for any judicial procedure in which an investor such as Achmea can bring a claim, before the EU judicature, for compensation from a Member State under a bilateral investment treaty such as the BIT.\n\n18\n\nIn the second place, the referring court questions whether Article¬†267 TFEU precludes an arbitration clause such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n19\n\nIt observes, first, that the arbitration procedure is not in itself capable of ensuring the uniform application of EU law that Article¬†267 TFEU aims to guarantee. Even though, under Article¬†8(6) of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal had to comply with EU law and, in the event of conflict, apply it in priority, it would not have the possibility of making a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling, however, since it could not be regarded as a ‚Äòcourt or tribunal‚Äô within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU.\n\n20\n\nThe referring court considers, next, that the uniform interpretation of EU law could nonetheless be regarded as being ensured in the present case, in that, prior to enforcement of the arbitral award, a court of the State may be called on to review the compatibility of the arbitral award with EU law, and can make a reference to the Court if need be. Further, in accordance with Paragraph¬†1059(2)(2)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, one of the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award is that its recognition or enforcement would be contrary to public policy. In line with the Court‚Äôs rulings on arbitral awards deciding disputes between individuals, the national courts‚Äô power of review of an arbitral award concerning a dispute between an individual and a Member State can validly be limited solely to breaches of fundamental provisions of EU law. That circumstance should not lead to an arbitration clause such as that at issue in the main proceedings being contrary to Article¬†267 TFEU.\n\n21\n\nThe referring court adds, finally, that the Court has previously held that an international agreement providing for the establishment outside the institutional and judicial framework of the EU of a special court responsible for the interpretation and application of the provisions of that agreement is compatible with EU law in so far as there is no adverse effect on the autonomy of the EU legal order. The Court has not expressed reservations as to the creation of a judicial system that is designed, in essence, to resolve disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the actual provisions of the international agreement concerned and does not affect the powers of the courts and tribunals of the Member States in relation to the interpretation and application of EU law, nor the power, or indeed the obligation, of those courts and tribunals to request a preliminary ruling from the Court. The arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is called on precisely to rule on an infringement of the provisions of the BIT, which it must interpret in the light of EU law, in particular the provisions governing the free movement of capital.\n\n22\n\nIn the third place, the referring court notes that, unlike Netherlands or Slovak investors, those from Member States other than the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic are unable to bring proceedings before an arbitral tribunal instead of a court of the State, which represents a considerable disadvantage which may constitute discrimination contrary to Article¬†18 TFEU.¬†However, the restriction by an intra-EU bilateral agreement of an advantage to nationals of the contracting Member States is discriminatory only if the nationals of other Member States who do not enjoy that advantage are in an objectively comparable situation. That is not so in the present case, since the fact that the reciprocal rights and obligations apply only to nationals of the two contracting Member States is a consequence that is inherent in the bilateral agreements concluded between them.\n\n23\n\nHaving regard to the above considerations, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚Äò(1)\n\nDoes Article¬†344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the investment protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?\n\nIf Question 1 is to be answered in the negative:\n\n(2)\n\nDoes Article¬†267 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision?\n\nIf Questions 1 and¬†2 are to be answered in the negative:\n\n(3)\n\nDoes the first paragraph of Article¬†18 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision under the circumstances described in Question 1?‚Äô\n\nThe requests to have the written procedure reopened\n\n24\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Opinion of the Advocate General on 19¬†September 2017, the Czech, Hungarian and Polish Governments, by documents lodged at the Court Registry on 3¬†November, 19 and¬†16¬†October respectively, requested the reopening of the oral procedure pursuant to Article¬†83 of the Court‚Äôs Rules of Procedure.\n\n25\n\nIn support of their requests, those governments express their disagreement with the Advocate General‚Äôs Opinion.\n\n26\n\nHowever, first, the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice make no provision for the interested parties referred to in Article¬†23 of the Statute to submit observations in response to the Advocate General‚Äôs Opinion (judgment of 22¬†June 2017, Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging and Others,¬†[C‚Äë126/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2017:489](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point30)).\n\n27\n\nSecondly, under the second paragraph of Article¬†252 TFEU, the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, is to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which, in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, require the Advocate General‚Äôs involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General‚Äôs conclusion or by the reasoning which led to that conclusion. Consequently, a party‚Äôs disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions that he examines in his Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgment of 25¬†October 2017, Polbud¬†‚Äî Wykonawstwo,¬†[C‚Äë106/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2017:804](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A804\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point24)¬†and the case-law cited).\n\n28\n\nNevertheless, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in accordance with Article¬†83 of its Rules of Procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the interested persons (judgment of 22¬†June 2017, Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging and Others,¬†[C‚Äë126/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2017:489](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A489\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point33)¬†and the case-law cited).\n\n29\n\nIn the present case, since the requests confine themselves to expressing the disagreement of the Czech, Hungarian and Polish Governments with the Opinion of the Advocate General and do not mention any new argument on the basis of which the present case should be decided, the Court considers, after hearing the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary elements to give judgment and that they need not be debated between the interested persons.\n\n30\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing, the requests for the oral procedure to be reopened must be rejected.\n\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\nQuestions 1 and¬†2\n\n31\n\nBy its first and second questions, which should be taken together, the referring court essentially asks whether Articles¬†267 and¬†344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article¬†8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\n32\n\nIn order to answer those questions, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court. That principle is enshrined in particular in Article¬†344 TFEU, under which the Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties (Opinion¬†[2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en)¬†(Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18¬†December 2014,¬†[EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[201](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point201)¬†and the case-law cited).\n\n33\n\nAlso according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other (see, to that effect, Opinion¬†[2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en)¬†(Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18¬†December 2014,¬†[EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[165](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point165)¬†to¬†[167](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point167)¬†and the case-law cited).\n\n34\n\nEU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in Article¬†2 TEU.¬†That premiss implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article¬†4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU

the judicial system as thus conceived has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article¬†267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court and another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member States, has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties (Opinion¬†[2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en)¬†(Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18¬†December

cited).\n\n38\n\nThe first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling must be answered in the light of those considerations.\n\n39\n\nIt must be ascertained, first, whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article¬†8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.\n\n40\n\nEven if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the very broad wording of Article¬†8(1) of the BIT, is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article¬†8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.\n\n41\n\nGiven the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph¬†33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.\n\n42\n\nIt follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.\n\n43\n\nIt must therefore be ascertained, secondly, whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular whether it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU.¬†The consequence of a tribunal set up by Member States being situated within the EU judicial system is that its decisions are subject to mechanisms capable of ensuring the full effectiveness of the rules of the EU (see, to that effect, Opinion¬†[1/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026locale=en)¬†(Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system) of 8¬†March

([C‚Äë377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court derived the status of ‚Äòcourt or tribunal of a Member State‚Äô of the tribunal in question from the fact that the tribunal as a whole was part of the system of judicial resolution of tax disputes provided for by the Portuguese constitution itself (see, to that effect, judgment of 12¬†June 2014, Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e

the case in the main proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is not part of the judicial system of the Netherlands or Slovakia. Indeed, it is precisely the exceptional nature of the tribunal‚Äôs jurisdiction compared with that of the courts of those two Member States that is one of the principal reasons for the existence of Article¬†8 of the BIT.\n\n46\n\nThat characteristic of the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings means that it cannot in any event be classified as a court or tribunal ‚Äòof a Member State‚Äô within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU.\n\n47\n\nThe Court has indeed held that there is no good reason why a court common to a number of Member States, such as the Benelux Court of Justice, should not be able to submit questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling in the same way as the courts or tribunals of any one of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgments of 4¬†November 1997, Parfums Christian Dior,¬†[C‚Äë337/95](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1997:517](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A517\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point21), and of 14¬†June 2011, Miles and Others,¬†[C‚Äë196/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:388](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40)).\n\n48\n\nHowever, the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is not such a court common to a number of Member States, comparable to the Benelux Court of Justice. Whereas the Benelux Court has the task of ensuring that the legal rules common to the three Benelux States are applied uniformly, and the procedure before it is a step in the proceedings before the national courts leading to definitive interpretations of common Benelux legal rules, the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings does not have any such links with the judicial systems of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 14¬†June 2011, Miles and Others,¬†[C‚Äë196/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:388](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[41](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A388\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point41)).\n\n49\n\nIt follows that a tribunal such as that referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT cannot be regarded as a ‚Äòcourt or tribunal of a Member State‚Äô within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU, and is not therefore entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\n50\n\nIn those circumstances, it remains to be ascertained, thirdly, whether an arbitral award made by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article¬†19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.\n\n51\n\nIt should be noted that under Article¬†8(7) of the BIT the decision of the arbitral tribunal provided for in that article is final. Moreover, pursuant to Article¬†8(5) of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal is to determine its own procedure applying the UNCITRAL arbitration rules and, in particular, is itself to choose its seat and consequently the law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the award by which it puts an end to the dispute before it.\n\n52\n\nIn the present case, the arbitral tribunal applied to by Achmea chose to sit in Frankfurt am Main, which made German law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the arbitral award made by the tribunal on 7¬†December 2012. It was thus that choice which enabled the Slovak Republic, as a party to the dispute, to seek judicial review of the arbitral award, in accordance with German law, by bringing proceedings to that end before the competent German court.\n\n53\n\nHowever, such judicial review can be exercised by that court only to the extent that national law permits. Moreover, Paragraph¬†1059(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides only for limited review, concerning in particular the validity of the arbitration agreement under the applicable law and the consistency with public policy of the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award.\n\n54\n\nIt is true that, in relation to commercial arbitration, the Court has held that the requirements of efficient arbitration proceedings justify the review of arbitral awards by the courts of the Member States being limited in scope, provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can be examined in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling (see, to that effect, judgments of 1¬†June 1999, Eco Swiss,¬†[C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[35](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point35),¬†[36](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point36)¬†and¬†[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40), and of 26¬†October 2006, Mostaza Claro,¬†[C‚Äë168/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2006:675](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34)¬†to¬†[39](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A675\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point39)).\n\n55\n\nHowever, arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT are different from commercial arbitration proceedings. While the latter originate in the freely expressed wishes of the parties, the former derive from a treaty by which Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence from the system of judicial remedies which the second subparagraph of Article¬†19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered by EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 27¬†February 2018, Associa√ß√£o Sindical dos Ju√≠zes Portugueses,¬†[C‚Äë64/16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2018:117](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A117\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34)), disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of EU law. In those circumstances, the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph relating to commercial arbitration cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT.\n\n56\n\nConsequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article¬†8 of the BIT and set out in paragraphs¬†39 to¬†55 above, it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.\n\n57\n\nIt is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected (see, to that effect, Opinion¬†[1/91](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026locale=en)¬†(EEA Agreement¬†‚Äî I) of 14¬†December 1991,¬†[EU:C:1991:490](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40)¬†and¬†[70](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point70); Opinion¬†[1/09](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026locale=en)¬†(Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system) of 8¬†March 2011,¬†[EU:C:2011:123](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[74](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point74)¬†and¬†[76](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A123\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point76); and Opinion¬†[2/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026locale=en)¬†(Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18¬†December 2014,¬†[EU:C:2014:2454](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[182](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point182)¬†and¬†[183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2454\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point183)).\n\n58\n\nIn the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article¬†8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article¬†8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article¬†267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in paragraph¬†34 above.\n\n59\n\nIn those circumstances, Article¬†8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.\n\n60\n\nConsequently, the answer to Questions 1 and¬†2 is that Articles¬†267 and¬†344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article¬†8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\nQuestion 3\n\n61\n\nIn view of the answer to Questions 1 and¬†2, there is no need to answer Question 3.\n\nCosts\n\n62\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n¬†\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n¬†\n\nArticles¬†267 and¬†344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article¬†8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\n¬†\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n(¬†[*1](#c-ECR_62016CJ0284_EN_01-E0001)¬†) Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.111669977Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Asturcom":{"title":"","content":"**Case C-40/08**\n\n**Asturcom Telecomunicaciones SL**\n\n**v**\n\n**Cristina Rodr√≠guez Nogueira**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Juzgado de Primera Instancia n¬∫ 4 de Bilbao)\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC ‚Äì Consumer contracts ‚Äì Unfair arbitration clause ‚Äì Measure void ‚Äì Arbitration award which has become final ‚Äì Enforcement ‚Äì Whether the national court responsible for enforcement can consider of its own motion whether the unfair arbitration clause is null and void ‚Äì Principles of equivalence and effectiveness)\n\nSummary of the Judgment\n\n_Approximation of laws ‚Äì Unfair clauses in consumer contracts ‚Äì Directive 93/13_\n\n_(Council Directive 93/13, Art. 6(1))_\n\nDirective 93/13 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature.

The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any dispute concerning the performance of the contract was to be referred for arbitration to the Asociaci√≥n Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and Equity) (‚ÄòAEADE‚Äô). The seat of that arbitration tribunal, which was not indicated in the contact, is located in Bilbao.\n\n21¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Since Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira failed to pay a number of bills and terminated the contract before the agreed minimum subscription period had expired, Asturcom initiated arbitration proceedings against her before the AEADE.\n\n22¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The arbitration award, made on 14 April 2005, ordered Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira to pay the sum of EUR¬†669.60.\n\n23¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Since Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira did not initiate proceedings for annulment of the arbitration award, it became final.\n\n24¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On 29 October 2007, Asturcom brought an action before the Juzgado de Primera Instancia (Court of First Instance) No¬†4 de Bilbao (Spain) for enforcement of the arbitration award.\n\n25¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In its order for reference, that court states that the arbitration clause in the subscription contract is unfair, particularly in view of the fact that, first, the costs incurred by the consumer in travelling to the seat of the arbitration tribunal were greater than the amount at issue in the dispute in the main proceedings. Next, according to that court, that seat is located at a considerable distance from the consumer‚Äôs place of residence and its location is not indicated in the contract. Lastly, that body itself draws up the contracts which are subsequently used by telecommunications undertakings.\n\n26¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, the referring court also points out, first, that arbitrators are not permitted under Law 60/2003 to examine of their own motion whether unfair arbitration clauses are void and, second, Law 1/2000 does not contain any provision dealing with the assessment to be carried by the court or tribunal having jurisdiction as to whether arbitration clauses are unfair when adjudicating on an action for enforcement of an arbitration award that has become final.\n\n27¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In those circumstances, since it entertained doubts as to whether the national legislation, in particular its domestic procedural rules, is compatible with Community law, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No¬†4 de Bilbao decided to stay the proceedings and to refer to the Court the following question for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚ÄòIn order that the protection given to consumers by [Directive 93/13] should be guaranteed, is it necessary for the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair arbitration clause that is to the detriment of the consumer?‚Äô\n\n¬†**The question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n28¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†By its question, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No¬†4 de Bilbao asks, in essence, whether the Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has acquired the force of res judicata and was made in the absence of the consumer is required to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a consumer and a seller or supplier is unfair and to annul the award.\n\n29¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†For the purpose of replying to the question referred, it is appropriate to note, first, that the system of protection introduced by Directive 93/13 is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-√†-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of those terms (Joined Cases C‚Äë240/98 to C‚Äë244/98¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_¬†[2000] ECR I‚Äë4941, paragraph¬†25, and Case C‚Äë168/05¬†_Mostaza Claro_¬†[2006] ECR I‚Äë10421, paragraph¬†25).\n\n30¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As regards that weaker position, Article¬†6(1) of that directive provides that unfair terms are not binding on the consumer. As is apparent from case-law, that is a mandatory provision which aims to replace the formal balance which the contract establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph¬†36, and Case C‚Äë243/08¬†_Pannon GSM_¬†[2009] ECR I‚Äë0000, paragraph¬†25).\n\n31¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In order to guarantee the protection intended by Directive 93/13, the Court has also stated on a number of occasions that the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier may be corrected only by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract (_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph¬†27, and¬†_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph¬†26).\n\n32¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is in the light of those principles that the Court has therefore held that the national court is required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph¬†38).\n\n33¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, the present case can be distinguished from that which gave rise to the judgment in¬†_Mostaza Claro_¬†in that Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira did not in any way become involved in the various proceedings relating to the dispute between her and Asturcom and, in particular, did not bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award made by the AEADE in order to challenge the arbitration clause on the ground that it was unfair, so that that award now has the force of res judicata.\n\n34¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether the need to replace the formal balance which the contract establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them requires the court or tribunal responsible for enforcement to ensure that the consumer is afforded absolute protection, even where the consumer has not brought any legal proceedings in order to assert his rights and notwithstanding the fact that the domestic rules of procedure apply the principle of res judicata.\n\n35¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is necessary at the outset to draw attention to the importance, both for the Community legal order and for the national legal systems, of the principle of res judicata.\n\n36¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to observe that, in order to ensure stability of the law and legal relations, as well as the sound administration of justice, it is important that judicial decisions which have become definitive after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after expiry of the time-limits provided to exercise those rights can no longer be called into question (Case C‚Äë224/01¬†_K√∂bler_¬†[2003] ECR I‚Äë10239, paragraph¬†38; Case C‚Äë234/04¬†_Kapferer_¬†[2006] ECR I‚Äë2585, paragraph¬†20; and Case C‚Äë2/08¬†_Fallimento Olimpiclub_¬†[2009] ECR I‚Äë0000, paragraph 22).\n\n37¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Consequently, according to the case-law of the Court, Community law does not require a national court to disapply domestic rules of procedure conferring finality on a decision, even if to do so would make it possible to remedy an infringement of a provision of Community law, regardless of its nature, on the part of the decision at issue (see, inter alia, Case C‚Äë126/97¬†_Eco Swiss_¬†[1999] ECR I‚Äë3055, paragraphs¬†47 and 48;¬†_Kapferer_, paragraph¬†21; and¬†_Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph¬†23).\n\n38¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the absence of Community legislation in this area, the rules implementing the principle of res judicata are a matter for the national legal order, in accordance with the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States. However, those rules must not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence); nor may they be framed in such a way as to make it in practice impossible or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness) (see, inter alia,¬†_Kapferer_, paragraph¬†22, and¬†_Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph¬†24).\n\n39¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As regards, first, the principle of effectiveness, the Court has already held that every case in which the question arises as to whether a national procedural provision makes the application of Community law impossible or excessively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, its progress and its special features, viewed as a whole, before the various national bodies. For those purposes, account must be taken, where appropriate, of the basic principles of the domestic judicial system, such as protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of procedure (Case C-312/93¬†_Peterbroeck_¬†[1995] ECR I-4599, paragraph¬†14, and¬†_Fallimento Olimpiclub_, paragraph¬†27).\n\n40¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the present case, the arbitration award at issue in the main proceedings became final because the consumer in question did not bring an action for annulment of the award within the time-limit prescribed for that purpose.\n\n41¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to established case-law, it is compatible with Community law to lay down reasonable time-limits for bringing proceedings in the interests of legal certainty (see, to this effect, Case 33/76¬†_Rewe-Zentralfinanz and Rewe-Zentral_¬†[1976] ECR 1989, paragraph¬†5; Case C‚Äë261/95¬†_Palmisani_¬†[1997] ECR I‚Äë4025, paragraph¬†28; and Case C‚Äë2/06¬†_Kempter_¬†[2008] ECR I‚Äë411, paragraph¬†58). Such time-limits are not liable to make it virtually impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights conferred by Community law (see, to that effect, Case C‚Äë255/00¬†_Grundig Italiana_¬†[2002] ECR I‚Äë8003, paragraph¬†34).\n\n42¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether it is reasonable to impose a two-month time-limit, such as that laid down in Article¬†41(4) of Law 60/2003, upon the expiry of which, in the absence of any action for annulment, an arbitration award becomes final and thus acquires the authority of res judicata.\n\n43¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the present case, it should be noted first that, as the Court has already held, a period of 60 days is not objectionable per se (see, to that effect,¬†_Peterbroeck_, paragraph¬†16).\n\n44¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A peremptory time-limit of that kind is reasonable in that it enables both an assessment to be made as to whether there are grounds for challenging an arbitration award and, if appropriate, the action for annulment of the award to be prepared. It should be pointed out that in the present case it has not been alleged that the national procedural rules governing the bringing of an action for annulment of an arbitration award, in particular the ruling imposing a two-month time-limit for that purpose, were unreasonable.\n\n45¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Moreover, it should be pointed out that Article¬†41(4) of Law 60/2003 provides that the time-limit starts to run from the date of notification of the arbitration award. Therefore, in the action in the main proceedings, it was not possible for the consumer to have found herself in a situation in which the limitation period had started to run, or had expired, without even being aware of the effects of the unfair arbitration clause upon her.\n\n46¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In such circumstances, such a time-limit is consistent with the principle of effectiveness, since it is not in itself likely to make it virtually impossible or excessively difficult to exercise any rights which the consumer derives from Directive 93/13 (see, to that effect, Case C‚Äë327/00¬†_Santex_¬†[2003] ECR I‚Äë1877, paragraph¬†55).\n\n47¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In any event, the need to comply with the principle of effectiveness cannot be stretched so far as to mean that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, a national court is required not only to compensate for a procedural omission on the part of a consumer who is unaware of his rights, as in the case which gave rise to the judgment in¬†_Mostaza Claro_, but also to make up fully for the total inertia on the part of the consumer concerned who, like the defendant in the main proceedings, neither participated in the arbitration proceedings nor brought an action for annulment of the arbitration award, which therefore became final.\n\n48¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be held that the procedural rules laid down by the Spanish system for the protection of consumers against unfair terms in contracts does not make it impossible or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred on consumers by Directive 93/13.\n\n49¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Next, in accordance with the principle of equivalence, the conditions imposed by domestic law under which the courts and tribunals may apply a rule of Community law of their own motion must not be less favourable than those governing the application by those bodies of their own motion of rules of domestic law of the same ranking (see, to that effect, inter alia, Joined Cases C‚Äë430/93 and C‚Äë431/93¬†_van Schijndel and van Veen_¬†[1995] ECR I‚Äë4705, paragraphs¬†13 and 17 and the case-law cited).\n\n50¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In order to determine whether that principle is complied with in the case before the national court, it is for that court, which alone has direct knowledge of the detailed procedural rules governing actions in the field of domestic law, to consider both the purpose and the essential characteristics of domestic actions which are claimed to be similar (see, inter alia, Case C‚Äë78/98¬†_Preston and Others_¬†[2000] ECR I‚Äë3201, paragraphs¬†49 and 56). However, with a view to the appraisal to be carried out by the national court, the Court may provide guidance for the interpretation of Community law (see¬†_Preston and Others_, paragraph¬†50).\n\n51¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As pointed out at paragraph¬†30 above, Article¬†6(1) of Directive 93/13 is a mandatory provision. It should also be noted that, according to the Court‚Äôs case-law, that directive as a whole constitutes, in accordance with Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the European Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life throughout the Community (_Mostaza Claro_, paragraph¬†37).\n\n52¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accordingly, in view of the nature and importance of the public interest underlying the protection which Directive 93/13 confers on consumers,  \nArticle¬†6 of the directive must be regarded as a provision of equal standing to national rules which rank, within the domestic legal system, as rules of public policy.\n\n53¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It follows from this that, inasmuch as the national court or tribunal seised of an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award is required, in accordance with domestic rules of procedure, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is in conflict with domestic rules of public policy, it is also obliged to assess of its own motion whether that clause is unfair in the light of Article¬†6 of that directive, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task (see, to that effect,¬†_Pannon GSM_, paragraph¬†32).\n\n54¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The national court or tribunal is also under such an obligation where, under the domestic legal system, it has a discretion whether to consider of its own motion whether such a clause is in conflict with national rules of public policy (see, to that effect,¬†_van Schijndel and van Veen_, paragraphs¬†13, 14 and 22, and¬†_Kempter_, paragraph¬†45).\n\n55¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As regards the case in the main proceedings, according to the Spanish Government, the court or tribunal responsible for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final has jurisdiction to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a consumer and a seller or supplier is null and void on the ground that such a clause is contrary to national rules of public policy. Moreover, a number of recent judgments of the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Provincial Court, Madrid) (Spain) and the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) (Spain) have acknowledged that jurisdiction.\n\n56¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is therefore for the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao to ascertain whether that is the case in the dispute before it.\n\n57¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Lastly, as regards the consequences of a finding by the court responsible for enforcement that the arbitration clause in a contract concluded by a seller or supplier with a consumer is unfair, it should be recalled that Article¬†6(1) of Directive 93/13 requires the Member States to lay down that unfair terms are not to be binding on the consumer, ‚Äòas provided for under their national law‚Äô.\n\n58¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accordingly, as the Hungarian Government suggested in its written observations, it is for the referring court to give due effect, in accordance with national law, to any finding in relation to the arbitration award that an arbitration clause is unfair, so long as the clause is not capable of binding the consumer.\n\n59¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature. If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause.\n\n¬†**Costs**\n\n60¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n**Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair, in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature. If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62008CJ0040#Footref*)¬†Language of the case: Spanish.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.111669977Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Asturcom-AG":{"title":"","content":"## Opinion of the Advocate-General\n\nI¬†‚Äì¬†Introduction\n\n1. In the present reference for a preliminary ruling, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao (Court of First Instance No 4, Bilbao) (‚Äòthe referring court‚Äô) has asked the Court of Justice a question on the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5¬†April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts.¬†(2)\n\n2. Specifically, the question is whether, in order for the purpose of the directive, which is to protect consumers, to be attained, the national court hearing an action for enforcement must determine of its own motion whether an arbitration agreement is void and accordingly annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.\n\nII¬†‚Äì¬†Legislative framework\n\nA¬†‚Äì Community law\n\n3. Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13 provides as follows:\n\n‚ÄòA contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.‚Äô\n\n4. Article 6(1) of that directive states as follows:\n\n‚ÄòMember States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for under their national law, not be binding on the consumer and that the contract shall continue to bind the parties upon those terms if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair terms.‚Äô\n\n5. Article 7(1) of the directive provides as follows:\n\n‚ÄòMember States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers.‚Äô\n\n6. The annex to the directive contains an indicative list of the terms which may be regarded as unfair. Point 1(q) of the annex mentions terms which have the object or effect of ‚Äòexcluding or hindering the consumer‚Äôs right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy, particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not covered by legal provisions, unduly restricting the evidence available to him or imposing on him a burden of proof which, according to the applicable law, should lie with another party to the contract‚Äô.\n\nB¬†‚Äì National law\n\n7. Under Spanish law, consumers were initially protected against unfair terms by Ley General 26/1984 para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios (General Law 26/1984 for the protection of consumers and users) of 19 July 1984, Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (Official State Gazette) (BOE) No 176 of 24 July 1984 (‚ÄòLaw¬†26/1984‚Äô).\n\n8. Law 26/1984 was amended by Ley 7/1998 sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contrataci√≥n (Law 7/1998 on general contractual conditions) of 13 April 1998 (BOE No 89 of 14 April 1998) (‚ÄòLaw¬†7/1998‚Äô), which transposed the directive into national law.\n\n9. In particular, Law 7/1998 added to Law 26/1984 an Article 10a, paragraph 1 of which provides as follows:\n\n‚ÄòAll those terms not individually negotiated which, contrary to the requirement of good faith, cause a significant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer, shall be regarded as unfair terms. In any event, the terms listed in the first additional provision to this Law shall be regarded as unfair.\n\n‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n10. Article 8 of Law 7/1998 provides as follows:\n\n‚Äò1. General conditions which infringe the provisions of this Law or any other rule ordering or prohibiting certain conduct, to the detriment of a party to the contract, shall automatically be void, save in so far as they make separate provision for cases of breach.\n\n2. In particular, general terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article¬†10a and the first additional provision of Law 26/1984 ‚Ä¶ shall be void.‚Äô\n\n11. At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, arbitration proceedings were governed by Ley 60/2003 de Arbitraje (Law 60/2003 on arbitration) of 23¬†December 2003 (BOE No 309 of 26 December 2003) (‚ÄòLaw 60/2003‚Äô).\n\n12. Article 8(4) and (5) of Law 60/2003 is worded as follows:\n\n‚Äò4. The court of first instance of the place in which the award was made shall have jurisdiction to hear an action for enforcement of the award in accordance with Article 545(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure ‚Ä¶\n\n5. An action for annulment of an arbitration award shall be brought before the Audiencia Provincial [Provincial Court] of the place in which that award was made.‚Äô\n\n13. Article 22 of Law 60/2003 provides as follows:\n\n‚Äò1. Arbitrators shall have jurisdiction to rule in matters falling within their own competence, including pleas relating to the existence or validity of arbitration agreements or any plea which, if upheld, would preclude an examination of the substance of the dispute. For that purpose, an arbitration agreement in a contract shall be regarded as a separate agreement, distinct from the other terms and conditions of the contract. Where it is decided by the arbitrators that the contract is void, the arbitration agreement shall not automatically be void.\n\n2. The pleas referred to in paragraph 1 must be raised no later than in the statement of defence, and the fact that a party has appointed or participated in the appointment of the arbitrators shall not preclude it from raising such pleas. A plea alleging that the arbitrators do not have competence to adjudicate on the question at issue must be raised as soon as the question which is alleged to be beyond their competence is raised in the arbitration proceedings.‚Äô\n\n14. Article 40 of Law 60/2003 states as follows:\n\n‚ÄòA final award can be challenged in an action for annulment in accordance with the provisions laid down in this title‚Äô.\n\n15. Article 41(1) of Law 60/2003 contains the following provisions:\n\n‚ÄòAn award may be annulled only where the party seeking annulment claims and proves that:\n\n(a) the arbitration agreement does not exist or is invalid;\n\n(b) he was not duly notified of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or that, for any other reason, he has been unable to exercise his rights;\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n(f) the award is contrary to public policy.‚Äô\n\n16. Article 43 of Law 60/2003 states as follows:\n\n‚ÄòA final award shall have the effect of res judicata and any appeal against that award shall lie only on a point of law, in accordance with the provisions of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil (Code of Civil Procedure) applicable to final decisions.‚Äô\n\n17. Under Article 44 of Law 60/2003, the enforcement of awards is governed by the provisions laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure and Title VIII of that law.\n\n18. Article 517(2)(2) of Law 1/2000 of 7 January 2000 on Civil Procedure (BOE No 7 of 8 January 2000) (‚ÄòLaw 1/2000‚Äô) provides that arbitration awards or decisions are enforceable.\n\n19. Article 556(1) of Law 1/2000 lays down the right of the party against whom enforcement is sought to challenge enforcement within ten days following the date of notification of the enforcement order.\n\n20. Article 559(1) of Law 1/2000 sets out a number of procedural irregularities on the basis of which the party against whom enforcement is sought may challenge enforcement.\n\nIII¬†‚Äì¬†Facts, main proceedings and the question referred\n\n21. Mar√≠a Cristina Rodr√≠guez Nogueira (‚Äòthe party against whom enforcement is sought‚Äô) concluded with the operator Asturcom Telecomunicaciones SL (‚ÄòAsturcom‚Äô) a contract for mobile telephones for individuals on 24 May 2004. That contract contained an arbitration clause under which any dispute relating to the performance of the contract was to be referred to arbitration to the Asociaci√≥n Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity) (‚ÄòAEADE‚Äô).\n\n22. In the contract, the party against whom enforcement is sought undertook, inter alia, to maintain her subscription for a period of 18¬†months from the effective date of commencement of the service and to spend a minimum of EUR¬†6¬†per¬†line. She also undertook not to vary the terms agreed with the operator. She agreed to pay the bills and not to cancel any other lines rented from the same operator. It was also stipulated that if the customer was in breach of the contract, she would pay the operator the sum of EUR¬†300 per line rented. Where necessary, that sum would be claimed in relevant proceedings.\n\n23. Since the party against whom enforcement is sought failed to pay a number of telephone bills and terminated the contract before the end of the minimum subscription period, on 16 February 200[5] Asturcom initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE in Bilbao, claiming that she was in breach of the contract.\n\n24. By award of 14 April 2005, the party against whom enforcement is sought was ordered to pay a sum of EUR¬†669.60. Since she did not bring an action to have the award declared void, the award became final.\n\n25. On 29 October 2007 Asturcom lodged an application for enforcement of the award against Cristina Rodr√≠guez Nogueira, for the purpose of recovering the abovementioned sum, together with EUR¬†300 interest and costs.\n\n26. In its order for reference, the referring court first sets out the grounds on which it considers the arbitration agreement in the contract to be unfair. It refers, inter alia, to the fact that the association entrusted with arbitration itself draws up the mobile telephone contracts, that the arbitration agreement does not specify in which city the seat of arbitration is located or provide for a choice between a number of cities, and that the cost of travelling to the seat of arbitration is greater than the debt at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n27. Nevertheless, the referring court explains that the Spanish legislation governing arbitration neither requires nor permits arbitration tribunals to examine arbitration agreements of their own motion and to annul clauses which are void or unfair.\n\n28. The referring court has doubts as to the compatibility of those procedural rules with Community law. It has therefore stayed the proceedings in order to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚ÄòIn order that the protection given to consumers by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts should be guaranteed, is it necessary for the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair arbitration clause that is to the detriment of the consumer?‚Äô\n\nIV¬†‚Äì¬†Procedure before the Court\n\n29. The order for reference of 29 January 2008 was lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 5 February 2008.\n\n30. Written observations were submitted by Asturcom, the Governments of the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Hungary and by the Commission within the period laid down in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice.\n\n31. As none of the parties applied for the oral procedure to be opened, it was possible to prepare the Opinion in this case after the general meeting of the Court on 10 February 2009.\n\nV¬†‚Äì¬†Main arguments of the parties\n\n32. Asturcom proposes that the question asked by the referring court be answered in the negative. It points out that, even though the Spanish legal order does not expressly grant the national court any such power, the national court is nevertheless entitled, in accordance with the judgment in Mostaza Claro ,¬†(3) to review of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is void in an action for annulment. The national legislation is therefore consistent with the requirements laid down by Community law with regard to the protection of consumers against unfair terms.\n\n33. Asturcom also points out that the case-law of the Spanish Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) treats arbitration awards and judicial decisions in the same way, with the result that if ‚Äì as in the main proceedings ‚Äì an arbitration award is not challenged within two months of its notification, it acquires the force of res judicata , in the same way\\ as an unchallengeable and enforceable court judgment. Consequently, a court hearing an action for enforcement in respect of an unchallengeable arbitration award may not assess, ab initio and of its own motion, whether an arbitration agreement is valid or void, and thus refuse an enforcement order, as the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid has made clear in its rulings.\n\n34. Such an interpretation not only makes it possible to observe the principle of legal certainty, since the award has the force of res judicata , but is also compatible with the abovementioned judgment in Mostaza Claro , which recognises the national court‚Äôs power to determine whether an unfair arbitration clause is void only in an action for annulment of an arbitration ruling which is not yet final.\n\n35. The Hungarian and the Spanish Governments , on the other hand, suggest that the Court recognise that the national court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award has jurisdiction to determine whether an arbitration agreement is void. They essentially put forward the same arguments, in particular with regard to the possibility of the mutatis mutandis application of the principles developed in case-law.\n\n36. The Hungarian Government argues, in particular, that it is clear from the Court‚Äôs case-law that the reasons of public interest underlying the protective purpose of the directive, specifically require the national court to determine whether a term in a consumer contract is unfair, especially in a case such as that in the main proceedings.\n\n37. The Spanish Government essentially reaches the same conclusion, while at the same time providing some clarification as to national procedural law.\n\n38. For example, it points out that there is no incompatibility between the national legal order of the Member States and the Community legal order with regard to protection of consumers against unfair terms. Under the relevant Spanish rules, the validity of an arbitration clause can and must be examined as a matter of public policy, not only by the court hearing the main action, but also by the court responsible for enforcement, irrespective of whether the party concerned has appeared before the arbitration tribunal or the court responsible for enforcement and irrespective of whether that party has initiated proceedings.\n\n39. According to the Spanish Government, several judicial decisions in Spain, including a judgment of the Audiencia Nacional of 9 May 2005, have recognised that the national court has jurisdiction to review an arbitration award which it is called upon to enforce, in particular for reasons of public policy, even where neither of the parties has made such a request.\n\n40. Therefore, upon a proper implementation of the principle of consumer protection and a broad interpretation of the notion of public policy, the national court responsible for enforcement must be able to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration agreement is valid and to annul the arbitration award if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term.\n\n41. The Commission first of all highlights certain differences between the facts in the present case and the situation in Mostaza Claro . First, the consumer in the present case took no step to become involved in the proceedings and, secondly, the question of whether the arbitration clause is unfair has been raised not in an action for annulment of the award, but in enforcement proceedings. The Commission also acknowledges that the powers of review enjoyed by the court responsible for enforcement are more limited, in principle, than those of a court hearing an action for annulment.\n\n42. Nevertheless, the Commission argues that the importance of the aims pursued by the directive makes it necessary, exceptionally, for the court responsible for enforcement to have the power to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair and, if appropriate, to annul it. In cases such as that in the main proceedings, in which the consumer has not taken legal action to challenge the arbitration award, the court responsible for enforcement is the only impartial body, since it has no personal interest at all in maintaining the arbitration clause, an attribute which qualifies it to review the validity of that clause.\n\n43. Lastly, the Commission gives its view on the question raised by the referring court as to whether the national court has not only a power but also a duty to examine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair. Relying on paragraph 38 and the operative part of the judgment in Mostaza Claro , it concludes that the national court has such a duty.\n\nVI¬†‚Äì¬†Legal assessment\n\nA¬†‚Äì Introductory remarks\n\n44. According to the definition contained in Article 3 of Directive¬†93/13, an unfair term is a term which the economically stronger party draws up unilaterally in advance and imposes on the other party, who is not able to influence the substance of the term. What essentially distinguishes an unfair term according to Article 3(1) is that, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.¬†(4)\n\n45. The problem of unfair terms in consumer contracts was familiar long before Directive 93/13 entered into force. In a growing service-oriented consumer society such as Europe, the use of standard contracts, whose individual terms are no longer individually negotiated by the parties, had inevitably become increasingly widespread. The danger of using such contractual terms which have been unilaterally drawn up in advance lies in the failure to take into account or the insufficient attention paid to the interests of the the other party to the contract.¬†(5)\n\n46. Directive 93/13 is intended to redress this situation through a partial harmonisation of Member States‚Äô national consumer protection measures.¬†(6) Its aim is to guarantee uniform minimum protection against unfair terms in consumer contracts in the Member States of the Community. The key provisions of the directive are, first, Article 6(1), under which Member States must lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier are not to be ‚Äòbinding on the consumer‚Äô. Secondly, Article 7(1) provides that Member States must ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist ‚Äòto prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers‚Äô.\n\n47. From the point of view of legal doctrine, Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 93/13 are binding provisions of secondary law on consumer protection, the consequence of which is that contractual freedom, the principle expression of autonomy in private law, is restricted.¬†(7)\n\nB¬†‚Äì The power of national courts and tribunals to review unfair terms according to the Court‚Äôs case-law\n\n48. In the judgments in Oc√©ano ,¬†(8) Cofidis ,¬†(9) and Mostaza Claro ,¬†(10) the Court interpreted those provisions and gave them a significance which enables the national court, in the exercise of its functions, to take effective action against unfair terms. The present case must be considered against the background of those judgments. It must therefore be examined below to what extent the principles developed in those judgments may be applied to the present case in the light of the common features of the different cases.\n\n49. Regard must be had first of all to the principles developed in case-law on the basis of which the present case must then be examined.\n\n50. The starting point for the Court‚Äôs considerations in interpreting Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 93/13 was the fact that the system of protection introduced by the directive is based on the idea that ‚Äòthe consumer is in a weak position vis-√†-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of the terms‚Äô.¬†(11) The Court concluded from this that ‚Äòthe imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier may only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract‚Äô.¬†(12)\n\n51. The Court also found that the national court‚Äôs power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair must be regarded as constituting a proper means of achieving the result sought by Article 6 of the directive, namely preventing an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term. It also regarded this power held by the national court as a proper means of contributing to achieving the aim of Article¬†7, since if the court undertakes such an examination, that may act as a deterrent and contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers.¬†(13) The Court also held that the power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair must be regarded as necessary for the purpose of achieving effective consumer protection, especially since there is a real risk that the consumer, particularly because of a lack of awareness, will not challenge the term pleaded against him on the ground that it is unfair.\n\n52. On the basis of the above considerations, the Court ruled in Oc√©ano (14) that the protection provided for consumers by Directive 93/13 entails the national court being able to determine of its own motion whether a term of a contract before it is unfair when making its preliminary assessment as to whether a claim should be allowed to proceed before the national courts.\n\n53. In Cofidis ,¬†(15) the Court further clarified its case-law to the effect that the power of a national court to find, of its own motion or following a plea raised by the consumer, that a term of the contract is void cannot be made subject to provisions requiring observance of a limitation period.\n\n54. Lastly, in Mostaza Claro , (16) the Court ruled that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award may determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n55. The Court based its decision on the ground that the result sought by Article 6 of the directive could not be achieved if the court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award was unable to determine whether that award was void solely because the consumer did not plead the invalidity of the arbitration agreement in the course of the arbitration proceedings.¬†(17) Such an omission by the consumer could not then, under any circumstances, be compensated for by action on the part of persons not party to the contract. In the view of the Court, the regime of special protection established by the directive would be definitively undermined.¬†(18)\n\nC¬†‚Äì Analysis of the question referred\n\n1. The power of review of the court responsible for enforcement\n\n56. Like the Mostaza Claro case, the present case concerns an arbitration clause which the referring court considers to be unfair.¬†(19) According to the Court‚Äôs case-law, it is for the national court to determine whether a contractual term satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of Directive 93/13.¬†(20) In the view of the referring court, the arbitration clause at issue impedes Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira from exercising her rights of defence and from taking legal action or exercising any other legal remedy, which suggests that it falls within Article 3(3) of the directive, in conjunction with paragraph 1(q) of the Annex.\n\n57. However, the present case differs from Mostaza Claro in that Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira did not appear before the arbitration tribunal or bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award. Unlike in the Mostaza Claro case, the question therefore arises whether the national court may determine whether a term is unfair in the course of enforcement proceedings. A further difference lies in the fact that in Mostaza Claro the consumers relied expressly on the unfair nature of the arbitration clause at issue, whereas in the present case the referring court is asking whether the question whether such a clause is unfair must also be examined of its own motion by the court hearing an action for enforcement.\n\n58. With the exception of Asturcom, all the parties take the view that the national court must also have the power in enforcement proceedings to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul that clause. That view is correct.\n\n59. In my opinion, that interpretation takes best account of the aim of Directive¬†93/13, which is to protect consumers. It is also consistent with the wording of Article 7(1) of Directive 93/13, which expressly calls on the Member States to employ ‚Äòadequate and effective means‚Äô to protect consumers against the use of unfair terms. The need for national implementing measures to be effective ‚Äì a point emphasised by the Community legislature ‚Äì is of particular importance for the purpose of legal assessment of the question referred for a preliminary ruling. Lastly, that interpretation is in keeping with the consistent case-law of the Court, which requires the Member States, in implementing directives, effectively to guarantee the rights of individuals, if the directive grants such rights.¬†(21)\n\n60. This is certainly not inconsistent with the institutional and procedural autonomy enjoyed by the Member States. The Court has consistently held that, in the absence of Community rules governing the matter, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction and to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Community law.¬†(22)\n\n61. This is to be seen in the light of the fact that, according to settled case-law, the principle of effective judicial protection is a general principle of Community law stemming from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, which has been enshrined in Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and has also been reaffirmed by Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,¬†(23) proclaimed on 7 December 2000 in Nice.¬†(24) In addition, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the right to be heard must be guaranteed ‚Äòin all proceedings initiated against a person which are liable to culminate in a measure adversely affecting that person‚Äô,¬†(25) and thus also in arbitration proceedings.¬†(26)\n\n62. In the legal systems of the Member States, the purpose of enforcement proceedings is not, generally, to carry out a substantive examination of an arbitration award, but simply to enforce it. The possibility for the party against whom enforcement is sought to rely on substantive pleas against an enforcement order is, as a rule, also limited under the Member States‚Äô laws on enforcement and is available only if specific conditions are satisfied.¬†(27) Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is necessary to accord the national court a power of review along these lines also in enforcement proceedings, if the aim of Directive 93/13, which is to protect consumers, is not to be frustrated.¬†(28)\n\n63. An interpretation to the contrary would mean that the unfair nature of a contractual term would prevail definitively and irrevocably, to the detriment of the consumer. This would create a legal situation which the Community legislature sought to avoid at all costs, given the special importance attached to the protection of the economic interests of consumers.\n\n64. The circumstances of the present case provide a particularly striking demonstration of the fact that it would be incompatible with Directive 93/13 for the court responsible for enforcement to be deprived of such a power of review. In such a case, in order to be spared the negative consequences of a void contractual term, the consumer would really have to challenge the term in question before the enforcement proceedings, that is to say in the preceding proceedings. In the present case, Mrs Rodr√≠guez Nogueira, as the party against whom enforcement is sought, would have had to take part in the arbitration proceedings, the very lawfulness of which is questioned by the referring court. In other words, national law would expect the consumer to take part in invalid proceedings in order to be able to have the contract annulled. Such an outcome would be unacceptable and shows that the court responsible for enforcement must have an appropriate power of review.\n\n65. Furthermore, as the Court has held, in order for the objective of the directive to be attained, the imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier must be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract.¬†(29) According to the referring court, the Spanish legislation governing arbitration neither requires nor permits arbitration tribunals to examine arbitration clauses of their own motion and annul those which are void or unfair.¬†(30)\n\n66. However, even if arbitrators were required or permitted to do so, serious doubts would remain as to whether an arbitrator can always be regarded as independent and neutral, especially since an arbitrator may possibly have a personal interest in maintaining the arbitration clause on which he is required to adjudicate. The Commission correctly draws attention to that point.¬†(31) This is true, for example, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, where the arbitration agreement has been drafted by the same association which is entrusted with the arbitration proceedings. Consequently, the assessment of whether an unfair arbitration clause is void may not be given over to the arbitrator alone. Rather, this task must be the responsibility of a court, which fully guarantees the judicial impartiality required in a State governed by the rule of law.\n\n67. If, however, the person concerned does not bring an action for annulment of the arbitration award, which is a plausible assumption, particularly in view of the frequent lack of business experience among consumers,¬†(32) and if that award thus becomes final, the court hearing an action for enforcement will generally be the one and only judicial body with the power to assess whether a contractual term is lawful.¬†(33) It is therefore logical for the Community legal order to recognise that the court responsible for enforcement should have that power, specifically in view of its unique position. It is for the Member States to ensure that the court responsible for enforcement has the necessary procedural powers to reject an application for enforcement and to annul the arbitration award.\n\n68. One of the grounds on which an action for enforcement may be rejected may in principle be the need to protect a Member State‚Äôs public policy. Provision is made in this regard in international law in Article 5(2)(a) of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards¬†(34) and in Article 29(2) of the 1966 Council of Europe Convention providing a Uniform Law on Arbitration.¬†(35) The legal systems of some European Union Member States have a similar provision.¬†(36)\n\n69. Spanish substantive law does not expressly confer jurisdiction on the court responsible for enforcement to assess of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is lawful. The referring court draws attention to that fact in its order for reference. The powers of review of a Spanish court responsible for enforcement are therefore limited, as is the case in most Community Member States, and tend to be orientated towards observance of the formalities of the enforcement proceedings. Nevertheless, it must be stated that in the last few years various Spanish courts entrusted with the enforcement of arbitration awards have rejected applications for enforcement on the ground that the awards in question were incompatible with public policy.¬†(37) A substantial proportion of the case-law¬†(38) and academic legal writing(39) in Spain appears to concur with this view. A more recent line of cases essentially reaches the same conclusion, the need for consumer protection being cited as the jurisdiction for the court responsible for enforcement having such powers.¬†(40) Nevertheless, the legal situation in Spain does not yet appear to have been fully clarified, in the absence of clear rulings from the higher courts.\n\n70. It would seem to me appropriate for the Community legal order to embrace a principle which is recognised not only in international law, but also in the legal orders of some European Union Member States, according to which the enforcement of an arbitration award which is contrary to public policy is prohibited, in the light of the fact that in Mostaza Claro the Court implicitly ranked Community-law consumer protection provisions as rules capable of being governed by considerations of public policy.¬†(41) The Court concluded that the annulment of an arbitration award which infringed such a rule is justified.\n\n71. As the Court made clear in that judgment, the mandatory provision laid down in Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13, under which unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier must ‚Äònot be binding on the consumer‚Äô, requires the national court to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier.¬†(42) In addition, in the view of the Court, as the aim of Directive 93/13 is to strengthen consumer protection, it constitutes, in accordance with Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life in its territory.¬†(43)\n\n72. I am well aware that this interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of Directive¬†93/13 could ultimately amount to disregarding the principle of res judicata under the legal orders of some Member States, which necessarily raises the question as to how such an interpretation can be reconciled with the previous case-law of the Court of Justice on the authority to be accorded to legal acts and final national judgments which are contrary to Community law.\n\n73. In its judgment in Kapferer ,¬†(44) the Court drew attention to the importance, both for the Community legal order and national legal systems, of the principle of res judicata and in so doing confirmed the principle that, in order to ensure both stability of the law and legal relations and the sound administration of justice, it is important that judicial decisions which have become definitive after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after expiry of the time-limits provided for in that connection can no longer be called into question. The Court also ruled, by reference to the judgment in Eco Swiss ,¬†(45) that the principle of cooperation under Article 10 EC does not require a national court to disapply domestic rules of procedure in order to review a judicial decision that has become final and to set it aside if that decision is contrary to Community law.¬†(46)\n\n74. Nevertheless, the Court resolved this tension between legal certainty and consumer protection by implicitly stating that the principle of res judicata was subject to the observance of the principles of equivalence and of effectiveness. By laying down the procedural rules for proceedings designed to ensure protection of the rights which individuals acquire through the direct effect of Community law, Member States must ensure that such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and are not framed in such a way as to render impossible in practice the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness).¬†(47)\n\n75. In the light of the above considerations, and above all in view of the need for effective consumer protection¬†(48) and having regard to the case-law of the Court of Justice¬†(49) which expressly requires positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract, I am convinced that it may be necessary, in exceptional cases, to disregard the principle of res judicata.\n\n76. It follows that the national court must reject an application for enforcement of a final arbitration award made in the absence of the consumer and annul that award, if it finds that the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.¬†(50)\n\n2. Duty of examination of the court responsible for enforcement\n\n77. Although the question referred is not entirely clear in this respect, the referring court also appears to be asking the Court to answer the question whether the court responsible for enforcement is not only entitled but also obliged to determine of its own motion whether an arbitration clause is unfair.\n\n78. In this regard it must be stated, first of all, that in both Oc√©ano (51) and Cofidis (52) the Court referred to the ‚Äòpower‚Äô of the national court to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair. Prima facie, this might suggest that the national court may determine whether a term is unfair, but is not required to do so. However, such an interpretation of those judgments would fail to take account of the fact that the Court‚Äôs arguments centred on the aim of Directive 93/13, which is to protect consumers.\n\n79. The Court attached particular importance to the fact that such a judicial examination could act as a deterrent and thus contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers. In my opinion, however, the desired deterrent effect of such an examination would be substantially diminished if it were left to the discretion of the court responsible for enforcement. On the other hand, the protection of consumers would be ensured, in accordance with the requirements of Community law, if the national court were legally required to conduct such an examination.¬†(53)\n\n80. This idea also appears to underlie the judgment in Mostaza Claro . In that judgment, the Court found that the importance of consumer protection within the Community legal order justifies ‚Äòthe national court being required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier‚Äô.¬†(54)\n\n81. Accordingly, the Court also held in that judgment that Directive¬†93/13 ‚Äòmust be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment‚Äô. As has already been stated, the Court essentially based its ruling on the ground that Community-law consumer protection rules constitute rules of public policy.¬†(55)\n\n82. It therefore follows from the above considerations that Community imposes a duty of examination on the national court.\n\nVII¬†‚Äì¬†Conclusion\n\n83. In the light of the foregoing, I propose that the Court answer the question referred by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao as follows:\n\nIn order that the protection given to consumers by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts should be guaranteed, the court hearing an action for enforcement of a final arbitration award, made in the absence of the consumer, is required to determine of its own motion whether the arbitration agreement is void and, accordingly, to annul the award if the arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.\n\n(1) .\n\n(2) ¬†‚Äì OJ 1993 L¬†95, p.¬†29.\n\n(3) ¬†‚Äì Case C‚Äë168/05 [2006] ECR I‚Äë10421.\n\n(4) ¬†‚Äì Kohles,¬†S., Das Recht der vorformulierten Vertragsbedingungen in Spanien ‚Äì Die Umsetzung der Richtlinie 93/13/EWG √ºber missbr√§uchliche Klauseln in Verbrauchervertr√§gen , Frankfurt am Main 2004, p.¬†56.\n\n(5) ¬†‚Äì Baier,¬†K., Europ√§ische Verbrauchervertr√§ge und missbr√§uchliche Klauseln ‚Äì Die Umsetzung der Richtlinie 93/13/EWG √ºber missbr√§uchliche Klauseln in Verbrauchervertr√§gen in Deutschland, Italien, England und Frankreich , Hamburg 2004, p.¬†2.\n\n(6) ¬†‚Äì Like Directive 85/577/EEC on contracts negotiated away from business premises, Directive 97/7/EC on distance contracts and Directive 1999/44/EC on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, Directive 93/13 is also based on a minimum harmonisation approach. The Commission Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights of 8 October 2008, COM(2008)¬†614 final, which merges those four directives into a single horizontal instrument, expressly moves away from that approach. The draft directive now embraces a full harmonisation approach, with the result that Member States cannot maintain or adopt provisions diverging from those laid down in the directive. The purpose of the proposal is to contribute to the proper functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market and achieve a high common level of consumer protection by fully harmonising the key aspects of consumer contract law which are relevant for the internal market.\n\n(7) ¬†‚Äì With regard to the restriction of contractual freedom as a result of Community acts, see Basedow, J., ‚ÄòDie Europ√§ische Union zwischen Marktfreiheit und √úberregulierung ‚Äì Das Schicksal der Vertragsfreiheit‚Äô, Sonderdruck aus Bitburger Gespr√§che Jahrbuch 2008/I , Munich 2009. In the view of the author, secondary Community law is predominantly binding in so far as it relates to private contracts. The vast majority of the rules restrict contractual freedom, and only a few expressly refer to the possibility for the parties to regulate certain matters by way of contract. According to legal commentators, contractual freedom is seen as the principle expression of autonomy in private law and thus as a guarantee of individual rights. For a comparative law perspective on autonomy in private law, see as regards German law, Larenz,¬†K., Wolf, M., Allgemeiner Teil des b√ºrgerlichen Rechts , 9th edition, Munich 2004, paragraph 2, as regards Austrian law Koziol, H., Welser, R., Grundriss des b√ºrgerlichen Rechts.

Some legal systems may provide for exceptions, in the case of performance and deferment, if the party against whom enforcement is sought is able to furnish documentary proof. In principle, the party against whom enforcement is sought has legal remedies available by which he can challenge procedural errors on the part of the body responsible for enforcement. Depending on the legal system, he has available to him forms of action by which he can raise substantive pleas against enforcement (see Schellhammer,¬†K., Zivilprozess , 10th edition, Heidelberg 2003, p.¬†109 et seq., paragraphs 219 and 223; Lackmann,¬†R., Zwangsvollstreckungsrecht mit Grundz√ºgen des Insolvenzrechts , 6th edition, Munich 2003, p.¬†80, paragraph 210).\n\n(28) ¬†‚Äì See also Jordans,¬†R., ‚ÄòAnmerkung zu EuGH Rs.

Although complaints which may be raised in arbitration proceedings are precluded in principle in proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of the arbitration award, the author takes the view that exceptions are conceivable if there is a breach of public policy.\n\n(29) ¬†‚Äì See point 50 of this Opinion.\n\n(30) ¬†‚Äì See page 9 of the order for reference.\n\n(31) ¬†‚Äì See paragraph 37 of the Commission‚Äôs pleading. Pic√≥ i Junoy,¬†J., ‚ÄòEl abuso del arbitraje por parte de ciertas instituciones arbitrales‚Äô, Diario La Ley , Year XXVI, No 6198, also refers to the risk of partiality on the part of an arbitration tribunal. The author sees this as an exceptional ground of refusal of an application for enforcement, provided there is evidence of partiality.\n\n(32) ¬†‚Äì See point 51 of this Opinion.\n\n(33) ¬†‚Äì See Pic√≥ i Junoy,¬†J., loc. cit. (footnote 31).\n\n(34) ¬†‚Äì Available on the website of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) at http://www.uncitral.org. Article 5(2)(a) of the Convention provides as follows: ‚ÄòRecognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that: ‚Ä¶ (b)¬†The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country‚Äô. Pic√≥ i Junoy,¬†J., loc. cit. (footnote 31), takes the view that Spanish law must be interpreted in the light of this provision of international law. The national court would therefore have to reject the application for enforcement and annul the award.\n\n(35) ¬†‚Äì Available on the Council of Europe website. Article 29 of the Convention provides as follows: ‚Äò(1) An arbitral award may be enforced only when it can no longer be contested before arbitrators and when an enforcement formula has been apposed to it by the competent authority on the application of the interested party. (2) The competent authority shall refuse the application if the award or its enforcement is contrary to ordre public or if the dispute was not capable of settlement by arbitration‚Äô.\n\n(36) ¬†‚Äì In Germany the relevant provisions are contained in the Zivilprozessordnung (Code of Civil procedure) (ZPO). Under Paragraph 1060(1) of the ZPO, enforcement can be effected if the arbitration award is declared enforceable. Paragraph 1060(2) of the ZPO states that an application for enforcement must be rejected and the arbitration award annulled if one of the grounds for annulment set out in Paragraph 1059(2) is satisfied. Paragraph 1059(2)(2)(b) of the ZPO provides for a special ground for annulment. Thereunder, the award may be annulled if the court finds that the outcome of recognition or enforcement of the arbitration award is contrary to public policy. The grounds for annulment laid down in Paragraph 1059(2)(2) of the ZPO must be taken into consideration in enforcement proceedings ‚Äì of the court‚Äôs own motion (Senat, BGHZ 142, 204, 206) ‚Äì even after the expiry of the time-limits prescribed for bringing annulment proceedings (Paragraph 1059(3) of the ZPO). In Belgium Article 1710(1) of the Code Judiciaire (Judicial Code) provides that the enforcement of an arbitration award may be ordered only by the President of the court of first instance upon application by the party concerned. Article 1710(3) provides that the President must reject the application if, inter alia, the award is contrary to public policy.\n\n(37) ¬†‚Äì See, for example, the orders of the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (secci√≥n 14) of 28 July 2005 (rec. num. 302/2005) and of 29 July 2005 (rec. num. 155/2005).\n\n(38) ¬†‚Äì See the judgment of the Tribunal Supremo of 6 November 2007 (Judgment No¬†8/2007). The Tribunal Supremo states that the powers conferred on the court responsible for enforcement enabled it to review observance of the primacy of Community law and other grounds of public policy. However, the Tribunal Supremo did not refer to any legal provision in support of its legal view.\n\n(39) ¬†‚Äì See Pic√≥ i Junoy, J., loc. cit.

C‚Äë168/05 ‚Äì Elisa Maria Mostaza Claro gegen Centro M√≥vil Milenium SL‚Äô, Zeitschrift f√ºr Gemeinschaftsprivatrecht , 2007, p.¬†50, which interprets the judgment to the effect that the Court regarded the unfair nature of the clause in question as being so serious that it was a matter of public policy. In the view of Loos,¬†M., ‚ÄòCase: ECJ ‚Äì Mostaza Claro‚Äô, European Review of Contract Law , 2007, Vol. 4, p.¬†443, the Court accorded the mandatory provisions of the directive on consumer protection the status of rules of public policy, as it had done previously in connection with the rules on competition.

Nevertheless, they take the view that the Court‚Äôs arguments in that judgment may be interpreted in such a way.

Provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to simplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from Member States bound by this Regulation are essential.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n(11)\n\nThe rules of jurisdiction must be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant‚Äôs domicile and jurisdiction must always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject-matter of the litigation or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different linking factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n\n(12)\n\nIn addition to the defendant‚Äôs domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n(14)\n\nThe autonomy of the parties to a contract, other than an insurance, consumer or employment contract, where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed, must be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this Regulation.\n\n(15)\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. ...‚Äô\n\n4\n\nArticles¬†2 to¬†31 of that regulation, which appear under Chapter II thereof, contain rules on jurisdiction.\n\n5\n\nSection¬†1 of that chapter, entitled ‚ÄòGeneral Provisions‚Äô, contains Article¬†2(1), which is worded as follows:\n\n‚ÄòSubject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State.‚Äô\n\n6\n\nArticle¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 provides that a person domiciled in a Member State may be sued in another Member State ‚Äòin matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur‚Äô.\n\n7\n\nArticle¬†6(1) of that regulation states:\n\n‚ÄòA person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued:\n\n(1)\n\nwhere he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.‚Äô\n\n8\n\nArticle¬†23(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001, which appears in Section¬†7 of Chapter II, entitled ‚ÄòProrogation of jurisdiction‚Äô, provides:\n\n‚ÄòIf the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing; or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves; or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.‚Äô\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n9\n\nCDC, a company governed by Belgian law domiciled in Brussels, was established for the purpose of pursuing, both judicially and extra-judicially, claims for damages of undertakings affected by a cartel. By application of 16¬†March 2009, it brought an action for damages before the referring court against six chemical undertakings which, with the exception of the intervening party and former defendant, Evonik Degussa GmbH (‚ÄòEvonik Degussa‚Äô), which has its seat in Essen (Germany), were domiciled in five Member States other than the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n10\n\nIn support of its action, in which CDC seeks to have the defendants in the main proceedings ordered to pay damages jointly and severally and to provide disclosure, that undertaking relies on Commission Decision 2006/903/EC of 3¬†May 2006 relating to a proceeding under Article¬†81 [EC] and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement against Akzo Nobel NV, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB, EKA Chemicals AB, Degussa AG, Edison SpA, FMC Corporation, FMC Foret S.A., Kemira OYJ, L‚ÄôAir Liquide SA, Chemoxal SA, Snia SpA, Caffaro Srl, Solvay SA/NV, Solvay Solexis SpA, Total SA, Elf Aquitaine SA and Arkema SA (Case COMP/F/C.38.620¬†‚Äî Hydrogen Peroxide and¬†perborate) ([OJ 2006 L¬†353, p.¬†54](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2006:353:TOC)), in which the European Commission found that, in connection with hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate, the defendants in the main proceedings and other undertakings participated in a single and continuous infringement of the prohibition of cartel agreements provided for in Article¬†81 EC and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement. According to that decision, the infringement started on 31¬†January 1994 at the latest and lasted at least until 31¬†December 2000. It consisted principally in exchanging important and confidential market and/or company-relevant information, limiting and/or controlling production, allocating markets and customers and fixing and monitoring prices as part of multilateral and/or bilateral meetings and telephone conversations held at regular and irregular intervals mainly in Belgium, Germany and France.\n\n11\n\nIn that regard, CDC invokes agreements concerning the transfer of claims for damages entered into with 32 undertakings domiciled in 13 different Member States of the European Union or of the European Economic Area (‚Äòthe EEA‚Äô), some of which undertakings had previously concluded similar transfer agreements with 39 other undertakings. The undertakings at issue operate in the industrial pulp and paper processing industry. The applicant submits that, from 1994 to¬†2006, those undertakings purchased substantial quantities of hydrogen peroxide in various EU and EEA Member States, some undertakings having supplied hydrogen peroxide to plants in several EU Member States. According to the defendants in the main proceedings, some of the contracts of sale included agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction.\n\n12\n\nIn September 2009, CDC withdrew its action against Evonik Degussa following a settlement with that undertaking. In late 2009, the remaining defendants in the main proceedings joined the former defendant and the firms Chemoxal SA and Edison S.p.A. to the proceedings. Relying on various agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction provided for in some of the sales contracts by which they were bound to the undertakings allegedly victims of the defendants‚Äô cartel agreements, the defendants in the main proceedings contended that the referring court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.\n\n13\n\nIn that context, the referring court considers that it could have international jurisdiction only by virtue of Articles¬†5(3) and¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001. If the conditions for such jurisdiction were satisfied, CDC would be free to sue the defendants in the main proceedings before one of the courts deemed to have jurisdiction in accordance with those provisions, provided that the jurisdiction of those courts is not validly excluded in accordance with Article¬†23 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 or by an arbitration agreement.\n\n14\n\nIn those circumstances the Landgericht Dortmund decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚Äò1.\n\nIs Article¬†6(1) of [Regulation No¬†44/2001] to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action in which a defendant domiciled in the same State as the court and other defendants domiciled in other Member States ‚Ä¶ are together the subject of an application for disclosure and damages on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the ‚Ä¶ Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings?\n\nIs it significant in this regard if the action against the defendant domiciled in the same State as the court is withdrawn after having been served on all the defendants, before the expiry of the periods prescribed by the court for lodging a defence and before the start of the first hearing?\n\n2.\n\nIs Article¬†5(3) of Regulation ‚Ä¶ No¬†44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for disclosure and damages brought against defendants domiciled in a number of Member States ‚Ä¶ on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, the harmful event occurred in relation to each defendant and in relation to all heads of damage claimed or the overall loss in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented?\n\n3.\n\nIn the case of actions for damages for infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices contained in Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, does the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in [EU] law allow account to be taken of arbitration and jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of Regulation ‚Ä¶ No¬†44/2001 in relation to all the defendants and/or all or some of the claims brought?‚Äô\n\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\nThe first question\n\n15\n\nBy its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it may, under that provision, be expedient to hear and determine applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, as found by a decision of the Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for in EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised.\n\n16\n\nIn order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind from the outset that Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted independently, by reference to its scheme and purpose (see judgment in Reisch Montage,¬†[C‚Äë103/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

jurisdiction laid down in Article¬†6(1) provides that a person may, where he is one of a number of defendants, be sued in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings (judgments in Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

rule, because it derogates from the principle stated in Article¬†2 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 that jurisdiction is based on the defendant‚Äôs domicile, must be strictly interpreted and cannot be given an interpretation going beyond the cases expressly envisaged by that regulation (see judgment in Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

with recitals 12 and¬†15 in the preamble to Regulation No¬†44/2001, that rule of jurisdiction meets the wish to facilitate the sound administration of justice, to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and thus to avoid irreconcilable outcomes if cases are decided separately (judgment in Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

order for Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 to apply, it is necessary to ascertain whether, between various claims brought by the same applicant against various defendants, there is a connection of such a kind that it is expedient to determine those actions together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings (see judgments in Freeport,¬†[C‚Äë98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

In that regard, in order for judgments to be regarded as irreconcilable, it is not sufficient that there be a divergence in the outcome of the dispute, but that divergence must also arise in the context of the same situation of fact and law (see judgments in Freeport,¬†[C‚Äë98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40); Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[79](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point79); and in Sapir and Others,¬†[C‚Äë645/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2013:228](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[43](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A228\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point43)).\n\n21\n\nThe requirement that the same situation of fact and law must arise is satisfied in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings. Despite the fact that the defendants in the main proceedings participated in the implementation of the cartel at issue by concluding and performing contracts under it, in different places and at different times, according to Decision 2006/903 upon which the claims in the main proceedings are based, the cartel agreement amounted to a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement. That decision does not, however, determine the requirements for holding the defendants liable in tort, jointly and severally as the case may be, since this is to be determined by the national law of each Member State.\n\n22\n\nAs regards, finally, the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings, since the requirements for holding those participating in an unlawful cartel liable in tort may differ between the various national laws, there would be a risk of irreconcilable judgments if actions were brought before the courts of various Member States by a party allegedly adversely affected by a cartel.\n\n23\n\nNevertheless, the Court points out that, even in the case where various laws are, by virtue of the rules of private international law of the court seised, applicable to the actions for damages brought by CDC against the defendants in the main proceedings, such a difference in legal basis does not, in itself, preclude the application of Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001, provided that it was foreseeable by the defendants that they might be sued in the Member State where at least one of them is domiciled (see judgement in Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[84](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point84)).\n\n24\n\nThat latter condition is fulfilled in the case of a binding decision of the Commission finding there to have been a single infringement of EU law and, on the basis of that finding, holding each participant liable for the loss resulting from the tortious actions of those participating in the infringement. In those circumstances, the participants could have expected to be sued in the courts of a Member State in which one of them is domiciled.\n\n25\n\nIt must therefore be considered that determining separately actions for damages against several undertakings domiciled in different Member States which, contrary to EU competition law, participated in a single and continuous cartel may lead to irreconcilable judgments within the meaning of Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001.\n\n26\n\nThat said, it remains to be considered to what extent the applicant‚Äôs withdrawal of its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same Member State as the court seised is capable of rendering the rule of jurisdiction provided for in Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 inapplicable.\n\n27\n\nAccording to settled case-law, that rule cannot be interpreted as allowing an applicant to make a claim against a number of defendants for the sole purpose of removing one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled (judgments in Reisch Montage,¬†[C‚Äë103/05](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point32), and in Painer,¬†[C‚Äë145/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[78](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point78)).\n\n28\n\nThe Court has nevertheless stated that, where claims brought against various defendants are connected within the meaning of Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 when the proceedings are instituted, the rule of jurisdiction laid down in that provision is applicable without there being any further need to establish separately that the claims were not brought with the sole object of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where one of the defendants is domiciled (see judgment in Freeport,¬†[C‚Äë98/06](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[54](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point54)).\n\n29\n\nIt follows that where, when proceedings are instituted, claims are connected within the meaning of Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001, the court seised of the case can find that the rule of jurisdiction laid down in that provision has potentially been circumvented only where there is firm evidence to support the conclusion that the applicant artificially fulfilled, or prolonged the fulfilment of, that provision‚Äôs applicability.\n\n30\n\nIn the case in the main proceedings, some of the parties allege that, before the action in the proceedings was brought, an out-of-court settlement was reached between the applicant in the main proceedings and Evonik Degussa, whose seat is in Germany, and that the parties purposefully delayed the formal conclusion of that settlement until proceedings had been instituted, for the sole purpose of securing the jurisdiction of the court seised of the case as against the other defendants in the main proceedings.\n\n31\n\nIn order to be able to exclude the applicability of the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001, an allegation of that nature must nevertheless be supported by firm evidence that, at the time that proceedings were instituted, the parties concerned had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision‚Äôs applicability.\n\n32\n\nAlthough it is for the court seised of the case to assess such evidence, it must nevertheless be made clear that simply holding negotiations with a view to concluding an out-of-court settlement does not in itself prove such collusion. However, it would be otherwise if it transpired that such a settlement had, in fact, been concluded, but that it had been concealed in order to create the impression that the conditions of application of Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 had been fulfilled.\n\n33\n\nIn the light of the above, the answer to the first question is that Article¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as established in that provision, can apply in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, which has been established by a decision of the Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for under EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised, unless it is found that, at the time the proceedings were instituted, the applicant and that defendant had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision‚Äôs applicability.\n\nThe second question\n\n34\n\nBy its second question, the referring court asks whether Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States on grounds of a single and continuous infringement, as found by the Commission, of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each defendant and in relation to all damages claimed in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented.\n\n35\n\nGiven that the circumstances of the present case are characterised by the consolidation of a number of potential claims for damages brought by the applicant in the main proceedings which had been assigned to the applicant by several undertakings allegedly victims of the Hydrogen Peroxide cartel, it should be pointed out from the outset that the transfer of claims by the initial creditor cannot, by itself, have an impact on the determination of the court having jurisdiction under Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 (judgment in √ñFAB,¬†[C‚Äë147/12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A490\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2013:490](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A490\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

that the location of the harmful event must be assessed for each claim for damages independently of any subsequent assignment or consolidation.\n\n37\n\nIn that regard, the Court notes that Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted independently and strictly (judgment in Kolassa,¬†[C‚Äë375/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2015:37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab),

remains that the expression ‚Äòplace where the harmful event occurred or may occur‚Äô Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 is intended to cover both the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it, so that the defendant may be sued, at the option of the applicant, in the courts for either of those places (judgments in

with settled case-law, the rule of special jurisdiction laid down in Article¬†5(3) of that regulation is based on the existence of a particularly close linking factor between the dispute and the

paragraph¬†[47](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A37\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point47)).\n\n42\n\nIt needs to be examined, in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, where the linking factors capable of establishing the jurisdiction of the court in matters relating to tort and delict and quasi-delict lie.\n\nThe place of the causal event\n\n43\n\nWith regard to the place of the causal event, it must be pointed out at the outset that, in circumstances such as those in the present case, the buyers were supplied by various participants in the cartel within the scope of their contractual relations. However, the event giving rise to the alleged loss did not consist in a potential breach of contractual obligations, but in a restriction of the buyer‚Äôs freedom of contract as a result of that cartel in the sense that that restriction prevented the buyer from being supplied at a price determined by the rules of supply and demand.\n\n44\n\nIn those circumstances, the place of a causal event of loss consisting in additional costs that a buyer had to pay because a cartel has distorted market prices can be identified, in the abstract, as the place of the conclusion of the cartel. Once concluded, the participants in a cartel ensure through action or forbearance that there is no competition and that prices are distorted. Where the place of a cartel‚Äôs conclusion is known, it would be consistent with the aims outlined in paragraph¬†39 above for the courts of that place to have jurisdiction.\n\n45\n\nThat conclusion is, however, not relevant in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, according to the findings of the Commission as set out in the order for reference, it is not possible to identify a single place where the cartel at issue was concluded since the cartel consisted of a number of collusive agreements concluded during various meetings and discussions which took place in various places in the European Union.\n\n46\n\nThe above considerations are without prejudice to a situation in which, among several agreements that, as a whole, amounted to the unlawful cartel at issue, there was one in particular which was the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer. In that case, the courts in whose jurisdiction that particular agreement was concluded would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the loss thereby inflicted upon that buyer.\n\n47\n\nIn the latter case, as well as in that in which the referring court were to find that the cartel at issue in the main proceedings was nevertheless definitively concluded in its jurisdiction, the issue still needs to be addressed as to whether several participants in that cartel can be sued before the same court.\n\n48\n\nThe Court has indeed held on another set of facts that Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 does not allow the courts of the place where a harmful event occurred which is imputed to one of the presumed perpetrators of damage, who is not a party to the dispute, to take jurisdiction in an action against another presumed perpetrator of that damage who has not acted within the jurisdiction of that court (judgment in Melzer,¬†[C‚Äë228/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[41](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point41)).\n\n49\n\nHowever, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, there is no reason for preventing several perpetrators from being sued together before the same court.\n\n50\n\nIt follows that jurisdiction by virtue of Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 to adjudicate, on the basis of the causal event and with regard to all of the perpetrators of an unlawful cartel which allegedly resulted in loss, depends upon the identification, in the jurisdiction of the court seised of the matter, of a specific event during which either that cartel was definitively concluded or one agreement in particular was made which was the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer.\n\nThe place where the damage occurred\n\n51\n\nAs outlined in paragraph¬†41 above, the identification of the place where the damage occurred must make it possible to establish the jurisdiction of the courts objectively best placed to determine whether the constitutive elements that found the liability of the person sued are in fact fulfilled.\n\n52\n\nAccording to the settled case-law of the Court, the place where the damage occurred is the place where the alleged damage actually manifests itself (see judgment in Zuid-Chemie,¬†[C‚Äë189/08](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2009:475](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A475\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point27)). As for loss consisting in additional costs incurred because of artificially high prices, such as the price of the hydrogen peroxide supplied by the cartel at issue in the main proceedings, that place is identifiable only for each alleged victim taken individually and is located, in general, at that victim‚Äôs registered office.\n\n53\n\nThat place fully guarantees the efficacious conduct of potential proceedings, given that the assessment of a claim for damages for loss allegedly inflicted upon a specific undertaking as a result of an unlawful cartel, as already found by the Commission in a binding decision, essentially depends on factors specifically relating to the situation of that undertaking. In those circumstances, the courts in whose jurisdiction that undertaking has its registered office are manifestly best suited to adjudicate such a claim.\n\n54\n\nThose courts, as identified, have jurisdiction to hear an action brought either against any one of the participants in the cartel or against several of them for the whole of the loss inflicted upon that undertaking as a result of additional costs that it had to pay to be supplied with products covered by the cartel concerned.\n\n55\n\nHowever, given that the jurisdiction of the court seised of the matter by virtue of the place where the loss occurred is limited to the loss suffered by the undertaking whose registered office is located in its jurisdiction, an applicant such as CDC, who has consolidated several undertakings‚Äô potential claims for damages, would therefore, in accordance with the case-law set out in paragraph¬†35 above, need to bring separate actions for the loss suffered by each of those undertakings before the courts with jurisdiction for their respective registered offices.\n\n56\n\nIn the light of the above, the answer to the second question is that Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States as a result of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, which has been established by the Commission, in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each alleged victim on an individual basis and each of the victims can, by virtue of Article¬†5(3), choose to bring an action before the courts of the place in which the cartel was definitively concluded or, as the case may be, the place in which one agreement in particular was concluded which is identifiable as the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly suffered, or before the courts of the place where its own registered office is located.\n\nThe third question\n\n57\n\nBy its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article¬†23(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 and the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements in EU law must, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, be interpreted as allowing account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of that regulation.\n\n58\n\nBefore assessing that question, it must be made clear that, with regard to certain terms derogating from otherwise applicable rules allegedly contained in the contracts at issue but which do not fall within the scope of application of Regulation No¬†44/2001, the Court does not have sufficient information at its disposal in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court.\n\n59\n\nWith regard to the terms at issue in the third question which fall within the scope of that regulation, it is to be observed that, in the context of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed in Brussels on 27¬†September 1968 ([OJ 1972, L¬†299, p.¬†32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1972:299:TOC)), the Court has stated that, by concluding an agreement on the choice of court under Article¬†17 of the Brussels Convention, the parties may derogate, not only from the general jurisdiction under Article¬†2 thereof, but also from the special jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and¬†6 of that convention (see judgment in Estasis Saloti di Colzani,¬†[24/76](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1976:177](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1976%3A177\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point7)).\n\n60\n\nSince the interpretation given by the Court in respect of the provisions of that convention is also valid for those of Regulation No¬†44/2001 whenever the provisions of those instruments may be regarded as equivalent, it must be found that such is the case as regards the first paragraph of Article¬†17 of the Brussels Convention and Article¬†23(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001, which are drafted in almost identical terms (judgment in Refcomp,¬†[C‚Äë543/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2013:62](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point19)¬†and¬†[20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point20)).\n\n61\n\nIt must therefore be concluded that the court seised of a matter can, in principle, be bound by a jurisdiction clause derogating from the rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and¬†6 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 which was concluded by the parties under Article¬†23(1) of that regulation.\n\n62\n\nThat conclusion cannot be called into question by the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements. First, the Court has already held that the substantive rules applicable to the substance of a case must not affect the validity of a jurisdiction clause agreed in accordance with Article¬†17 of the Brussels Convention (see, to that effect, judgment in Castelletti,¬†[C‚Äë159/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:142](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[51](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A142\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point51)). In accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph¬†60 above, that interpretation is also relevant to Article¬†23 of Regulation No¬†44/2001.\n\n63\n\nSecond, it must be considered that the court seised of the matter cannot, without undermining the aim of Regulation No¬†44/2001, refuse to take into account a jurisdiction clause which has satisfied the requirements of Article¬†23 of that regulation solely on the ground that it considers that the court with jurisdiction under that clause would not give full effect to the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements by not allowing a victim of the cartel to obtain full compensation for the loss it suffered. On the contrary, it must be considered that the system of legal remedies in each Member State, together with the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article¬†267 TFEU, affords a sufficient guarantee to individuals in that respect (see, by analogy, judgment in Renault,¬†[C‚Äë38/98](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2000:225](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A225\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point23)).\n\n64\n#addthis #important\nIn a case such as that in the main proceedings, the court before which the action is brought must, nevertheless, ensure that the clauses at issue actually bind the applicant in the main proceedings before examining the requirements of form laid down in Article¬†23 of Regulation No¬†44/2001. As the Court has already made clear, a jurisdiction clause incorporated in a contract may, in principle, produce effects only in the relations between the parties who have given their agreement to the conclusion of that contract. In order for a third party to rely on such a clause it is, in principle, necessary that the third party has given his consent to that effect (judgment in Refcomp,¬†[C‚Äë543/10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2013:62](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[29](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A62\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point29)).\n\n65\n\nOnly where a party not privy to the original contract had succeeded to an original contracting party‚Äôs rights and obligations in accordance with national substantive law as established by the application of the rules of private international law of the court seised of the matter could that third party nevertheless be bound by a jurisdiction clause to which it had not agreed (see, to that effect, judgment in Coreck,¬†[C‚Äë387/98](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2000:606](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point24),¬†[25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point25)¬†and¬†[30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2000%3A606\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point30)).\n\n66\n\nIf the applicant to the main proceedings did prove to be bound by the clauses at issue, it would be necessary to ascertain whether they did, in fact, derogate from the referring court‚Äôs jurisdiction as far as the case in the main proceedings is concerned.\n\n67\n\nIn that regard, it is for the national court to interpret the clause conferring jurisdiction invoked before it in order to determine which disputes fall within its scope (judgments in Powell Duffryn,¬†[C‚Äë214/89](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1992:115](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point37), and in Benincasa,¬†[C‚Äë269/95](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1997:337](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[31](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1997%3A337\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point31)).\n\n68\n\nA jurisdiction clause can concern only disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, which limits the scope of an agreement conferring jurisdiction solely to disputes which arise from the legal relationship in connection with which the agreement was entered into. The purpose of that requirement is to avoid a party being taken by surprise by the assignment of jurisdiction to a given forum as regards all disputes which may arise out of its relationship with the other party to the contract and stem from a relationship other than that in connection with which the agreement conferring jurisdiction was made (see, to that effect, judgment in Powell Duffryn,¬†[C‚Äë214/89](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1992:115](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[31](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1992%3A115\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point31)).\n\n69\n\nIn the light of that purpose, the referring court must, in particular, regard a clause which abstractly refers to all disputes arising from contractual relationships as not extending to a dispute relating to the tortious liability that one party allegedly incurred as a result of its participation in an unlawful cartel.\n\n70\n\nGiven that the undertaking which suffered the loss could not reasonably foresee such litigation at the time that it agreed to the jurisdiction clause and that that undertaking had no knowledge of the unlawful cartel at that time, such litigation cannot be regarded as stemming from a contractual relationship. Such a clause would not therefore have validly derogated from the referring court‚Äôs jurisdiction.\n\n71\n\nBy contrast, where a clause refers to disputes in connection with liability incurred as a result of an infringement of competition law and designates the courts of a Member State other than the Member State of the referring court, the latter ought to decline its own jurisdiction, even where that clause entails disregarding the special rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and/or 6 of Regulation No¬†44/2001.\n\n72\n\nConsequently, the answer to the third question is that Article¬†23(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as allowing, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, even if the effect thereof is a derogation from the rules on international jurisdiction provided for in Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of that regulation, provided that those clauses refer to disputes concerning liability incurred as a result of an infringement of competition law.\n\nCosts\n\n73\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n¬†\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n¬†\n\n1.\n\nArticle¬†6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No¬†44/2001 of 22¬†December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as established in that provision, can apply in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, which has been established by a decision of the European Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for under EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised, unless it is found that, at the time the proceedings were instituted, the applicant and that defendant had colluded to artificially fulfil, or prolong the fulfilment of, that provision‚Äôs applicability.\n\n¬†\n\n2.\n\nArticle¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States as a result of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2¬†May 1992, which has been established by the European Commission, in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each alleged victim on an individual basis and each of the victims can, by virtue of Article¬†5(3), choose to bring an action before the courts of the place in which the cartel was definitively concluded or, as the case may be, the place in which one agreement in particular was concluded which is identifiable as the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly suffered, or before the courts of the place where its own registered office is located.\n\n¬†\n\n3.\n\nArticle¬†23(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as allowing, in the

contained in contracts for the supply of goods, even if the effect thereof is a derogation from the rules on international jurisdiction provided for in Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of that

Dortmund, Germany) concerns the interpretation of Articles¬†5(3) and¬†6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No¬†44/2001 of 22¬†December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters¬†(¬†[2](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0002)¬†) (the ‚ÄòBrussels I Regulation‚Äô) and, which is unusual, the interplay between those provisions and the guiding principles of European Union (‚ÄòEU‚Äô) competition law relating to Article¬†101 TFEU.\n\n2.\n\nThis request was made in the context of an action for disclosure and damages brought before the German court, by an applicant domiciled in Belgium, against several companies domiciled in various Member States¬†‚Äî only one in Germany¬†‚Äî which had participated in an infringement declared by a decision of the European Commission to be in breach of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article¬†81 EC (now Article¬†101 TFEU) and Article¬†53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2¬†May 1992.¬†(¬†[3](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0003)¬†)\n\n3.\n\nThe parties disagreeing as to the international jurisdiction of the referring court, the latter seeks the Court‚Äôs interpretation on three main points.\n\n4.\n\nIn the first place, the referring court questions the applicability, in a dispute such as that before it, of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, which authorises an extension of the jurisdiction of the court seised so that it may also deliver judgments in actions relating to defendants other than the defendant domiciled within its jurisdiction, in order to avoid irreconcilable judgments. In addition, those issues are raised in the particular case in which, as here, the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the Member State of the court seised, which can be regarded as the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô in that it alone can provide grounds for the court‚Äôs jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nIn the second place, in terms of jurisdiction in matters of tort or delict falling within Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, the Court has been asked whether the ‚Äòplace where the harmful event occurred‚Äô within the meaning of that provision must be interpreted as allowing that jurisdiction to apply with respect to all the defendants in respect of all the alleged damage, in every one of the numerous places in the Member States in which the unlawful cartel agreement was entered into and/or put into effect and in which, according to the applicant, purchasers‚Äô freedom of choice was thereby restricted.\n\n6.\n\nIn the third place, the referring court appears to start from the premise that some of the clauses conferring jurisdiction, which may fall under Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation and/or the arbitration agreements invoked by the defendants in the main proceedings, cover the claims for damages made in this case. The referring court has asked the Court to state whether, in the case in point, the principle of effective implementation of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices set out in Article¬†101 TFEU can preclude those clauses being invoked against the claimant for damages when the action has been brought before one of the courts having jurisdiction under Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n7.\n\nI would emphasise that this case is the first in which the Court has been asked to adjudicate directly on the interaction between, on the one hand, provisions of primary law guaranteeing freedom of competition within the European Union and, on the other, provisions of EU private international law relating to jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, in a dispute characterised by a far-reaching cartel agreement which has myriad participants and injured parties and has distorted competition throughout the internal market.\n\n8.\n\nFirst of all, I must point out that it appears to me that the Brussels I Regulation, the aim of which is to create a system of rules of jurisdiction for the Union in respect of cross-border disputes in civil and commercial matters, is not fully geared towards ensuring effective private implementation of the Union‚Äôs competition law (or ‚Äòprivate enforcement‚Äô, as it is usually called in this field)¬†(¬†[4](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0004)¬†) in circumstances such as those in this case.\n\n9.\n\nThe application of certain provisions of that regulation is likely to lead to a territorial division of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States which might, on the one hand, be inadequate from the point of view of the geographical scope of EU competition law or, on the other hand, make it more difficult for persons adversely affected by unlawful restrictions of competition to seek and obtain full reparation for the damage that they have suffered. It seems to me, therefore, possible that the authors of such restrictions could use those provisions of international private law to bring about a situation in which the civil-law consequences of a single, serious infringement of Union competition rules are to be determined in the context of a series of actions scattered across the various Member States.\n\n10.\n\nThe general conclusion that I shall draw from this request for interpretation is that,¬†de lege ferenda, because of the particular repercussions which cross-border anti-competitive practices are likely to have in terms of judicial cooperation in civil matters, especially when they are complex, as they are in the main proceedings, it would be advisable for the EU legislature to envisage incorporating in the Brussels I Regulation a rule of jurisdiction apt to cover such practices,¬†(¬†[5](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0005)¬†) on the lines of the conflict-of-laws provision which applies specifically to obligations deriving from acts restrictive of competition under the regulation usually known as ‚ÄòRome II‚Äô.¬†(¬†[6](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0006)¬†)\n\nII¬†‚Äì¬†Legal context\n\n11.\n\nRecitals 11, 12, 14 and¬†15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation state:\n\n‚Äò11.\n\nThe rules of jurisdiction must be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant‚Äôs domicile and jurisdiction must always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject-matter of the litigation or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different linking factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nIn addition to the defendant‚Äôs domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n14.\n\nThe autonomy of the parties to a contract, other than an insurance, consumer or employment contract, where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed, must be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this Regulation.\n\n15.\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. ‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n12.\n\nArticle¬†1(2)(d) of the Brussels I Regulation excludes arbitration from the scope of the regulation.\n\n13.\n\nChapter II of the regulation lays down a series of rules concerning jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters. Article¬†2(1) of the regulation lays down the principle that ‚Äò[s]ubject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State‚Äô.\n\n14.\n\nArticle¬†5(3) of that regulation, which is part of Section¬†2 of Chapter II, entitled ‚ÄòSpecial jurisdiction‚Äô, provides that ‚Äòa person domiciled in a Member State may, in another Member State, be sued ‚Ä¶ in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur‚Äô.\n\n15.\n\nArticle¬†6(1) in that Section adds that ‚Äò[a] person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued ‚Ä¶ where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings‚Äô.\n\n16.\n\nArticle¬†23(1) and¬†(5), in Section¬†7 of that Chapter, entitled ‚ÄòProrogation of jurisdiction‚Äô, is worded as follows:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. ‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†Agreements conferring jurisdiction shall have no legal force if they are contrary to the provisions of Articles¬†13, 17 or¬†21, or if the courts whose jurisdiction they purport to exclude have exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article¬†22.‚Äô\n\nIII¬†‚Äì¬†Main proceedings, questions referred for a preliminary ruling and procedure before the Court\n\n17.\n\nThe action in the main proceedings is based on a decision of 3¬†May 2006¬†(¬†[7](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0007)¬†) in which the Commission decided that several companies supplying hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium perborate¬†(¬†[8](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0008)¬†) had participated in a single and continuous infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article¬†81 EC (Article¬†101 TFEU) and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, for which reason some of those companies were ordered to pay fines.¬†(¬†[9](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0009)¬†)\n\n18.\n\nThat decision indicated that the period of infringement taken into account lasted from 31¬†January 1994 until 31¬†December 2000 and covered the whole territory of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the main, the cartel agreement in question had involved exchanges of information between competitors concerning prices and sales volumes, pricing agreements and production capacity reductions, and monitoring of the implementation of anti-competitive agreements. The referring court stressed that those concerted practices took place in the context of meetings and telephone calls which were held principally in Belgium, France and Germany and that the authors of the infringement had participated in different ways but knew that their secret actions to restrict competition were unlawful.\n\n19.\n\nCartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA (‚ÄòCDC‚Äô) is a company established in Belgium, whose object is to uphold rights to damages transferred to it, directly or indirectly, by some of the undertakings allegedly harmed in connection with that infringement.¬†(¬†[10](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0010)¬†)\n\n20.\n\nBy application of 16¬†March 2009, CDC brought a joint action for damages before the Landgericht, Dortmund, against six of the companies fined by the Commission, which were established in various Member States, but only one of them, namely: Evonik Degussa GmbH (‚ÄòEvonik Degussa‚Äô), which has its registered office in Essen (Germany),¬†(¬†[11](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0011)¬†) in the state of the court seised.\n\n21.\n\nIn September 2009, following notification of the action to all the defendants in the main proceedings but before the expiry of the period prescribed for lodging statements in defence and the opening of the oral procedure, CDC withdrew its action against the German company, as the result of an out-of-court settlement. At the end of 2009, the remaining defendants in the proceedings joined Evonik Degussa and two other companies affected by the Commission decision to the proceedings.¬†(¬†[12](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0012)¬†)\n\n22.\n\nCDC submitted that, from 1994 to¬†2006, the assignor undertakings had purchased, from suppliers having participated in the unlawful cartel, considerable quantities of hydrogen peroxide that were supplied on the basis of contracts to various Member States of the Union and the EEA.\n\n23.\n\nThe defendants in the main proceedings, pleading that some of those supply contracts contained arbitration and jurisdiction clauses, all raised the objection that the court lacked international jurisdiction.\n\n24.\n\nThe Landgericht, Dortmund, held that it could have jurisdiction only on the basis of Articles¬†6(1) and¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, unless such jurisdiction was not validly excluded in accordance with a jurisdiction clause under Article¬†23 of that regulation, or by an arbitration agreement. Accordingly, in a decision lodged on 26¬†June 2013, it stayed the proceedings and referred the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n(a)\n\nIs Article¬†6(1) of the [Brussels I] Regulation to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action in which a defendant domiciled in the same State as the court and other defendants domiciled in other Member States of the European Union are together the subject of an application for disclosure and damages on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient to hear and determine those claims together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings?\n\n(b)\n\nIs it significant in this regard if the action against the defendant domiciled in the same State as the court is withdrawn after having been served on all the defendants, before the expiry of the periods prescribed by the court for lodging a defence and before the start of the first hearing?\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†Is Article¬†5(3) of the [Brussels I] Regulation to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for disclosure and damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States of the European Union on account of a single and continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, the harmful event occurred, in relation to each defendant and in relation to all heads of damage claimed or the overall loss, in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented?\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†In the case of actions for damages for infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices contained in Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement, does the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in EU law allow account to be taken of arbitration and jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under Article¬†5(3) and/or Article¬†6(1) of the [Brussels I] Regulation in relation to all the defendants and/or all or some of the claims brought?‚Äô\n\n25.\n\nWritten observations were lodged by CDC, by Evonik Degussa solely in relation to subparagraph¬†(b) of the first question, by Akzo Nobel, Solvay, Kemira, FMC Foret and Edison, by the French Government solely in relating to the third question, and by the Commission. By letter of 26¬†August 2013, the referring court informed the Court that CDC had withdrawn its action against Arkema France. No hearing was held.\n\nIV¬†‚Äì¬†Analysis\n\nA¬†‚Äì¬†Preliminary remarks\n\n26.\n\nIn the first place, as regards the general issues arising in this case, I wish to emphasise that the Brussels I Regulation is not, in itself, intended to give effect to the rules of EU competition law. According to, inter alia, recitals 1, 2 and¬†6 in the preamble, the purpose of that regulation is to promote ‚Äòthe sound operation of the internal market‚Äô and to ensure ‚Äòthe free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters‚Äô by creating a unified framework for disputes in that field concerning both the allocation of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States and the recognition and enforcement of the judgments delivered by those courts.\n\n27.\n\nHowever, I consider that the interpretation and application of the Brussels I Regulation must make it possible to preserve the full effectiveness of provisions of EU competition law, which are vitally important for the internal market and constitute a fundamental element of the EU economic constitution¬†(¬†[13](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0013)¬†) because, as the Court has already stressed, Article¬†85 of the EC Treaty, now Article¬†101 TFEU, is a ‚Äòfundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community, and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market‚Äô.¬†(¬†[14](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0014)¬†) Furthermore, the procedural rules of EU law must, to a certain extent, serve the substantive rules of EU law, in the sense that the former are an instrument which enables the rights and obligations of private and public persons to be made tangible, particularly in terms of the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, as affirmed in Article¬†47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.¬†(¬†[15](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0015)¬†)\n\n28.\n\nIn this connection, it must be held, first, that the main proceedings concern the consequences which are liable to result, in civil law, from an offence consisting of a single continuous infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU committed by several companies established in the territory of different Member States, the numerous persons adversely affected by it also being established in different Member States.\n\n29.\n\nThe emergence of players on the judicial scene, such as the applicant in the main proceedings, whose aim it is to combine assets based on claims for damages resulting from infringements of EU competition law,¬†(¬†[16](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0016)¬†) seems to me to show that, in the case of the more complex barriers to competition, it is not reasonable for the persons adversely affected themselves individually to sue those responsible for a barrier of that type.¬†(¬†[17](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0017)¬†)\n\n30.\n\nNext, I would point out that, compensation for persons injured by an agreement or practice prohibited by EU law is an entitlement, the essence of which is governed by that law, in accordance with the decisions in¬†Courage and Crehan¬†(¬†[18](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0018)¬†) and¬†Manfredi and Others¬†(¬†[19](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0019)¬†) concerning the interpretation of Article¬†81 EC (Article¬†101 TFEU). That applies both to the existence of that right and to its basic substantive scope, which includes, inter alia, the possibility for injured persons of receiving compensation not only for the actual loss (damnum emergens) but also for the loss of profit (lucrum cessans) occasioned by such an agreement or practice, together with interest.¬†(¬†[20](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0020)¬†)\n\n31.\n\nNone the less, as the Court has pointed out, having regard to the current state of EU law, the rules for exercising that right to full compensation remain within the remit of the Member States, provided that the latter observe the principle of equivalence and the principle of effectiveness laid down in that case-law.¬†(¬†[21](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0021)¬†) This retention of legislative competence for the national legislatures in this sphere applies in particular to procedural rules, but no longer holds true for the rules on conflict of laws, because the ‚Äòlaw applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a restriction of competition‚Äô must in future be determined by the Rome II Regulation.¬†(¬†[22](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0022)¬†)\n\n32.\n\nBy analogy, the principle of effectiveness of actions for damages so laid down in relation to provisions of national law ought, in my view,¬†a fortiori¬†to guide the interpretation and application of the Brussels I Regulation, in that that regulation, being an instrument of secondary law adopted by the Union itself, must not be interpreted in such a way as to make it impossible in practice or excessively difficult in the context of an unlawful cross-border cartel agreement¬†(¬†[23](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0023)¬†) to give effect to that prerogative, which is conferred on the basis of primary law.\n\n33.\n\nIn the second place, I would stress that it is undisputed, as far as the Court‚Äôs case-law is concerned, that legal action which seeks, as in the present case, to obtain compensation from undertakings which have infringed Article¬†101 TFEU is ‚Äòcivil and commercial in nature‚Äô, within the meaning of Article¬†1(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.¬†(¬†[24](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0024)¬†)\n\n34.\n\nIn the third place, it must be noted that, in so far as, in relations between Member States, the Brussels I Regulation replaced the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 27¬†September 1968¬†(¬†[25](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0025)¬†) (the ‚ÄòBrussels Convention‚Äô), the Court‚Äôs interpretation of the provisions of the latter convention applies to the provisions of that regulation too, whenever the provisions of the two instruments may be regarded as equivalent.¬†(¬†[26](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0026)¬†)\n\n35.\n\nIn the light of the Court‚Äôs case-law, this equivalence appears to me to have been established for each of the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation referred to in this request for a preliminary ruling, namely: Articles¬†5(3), 6(1) and¬†23(1), given that the content of the corresponding provisions of the Brussels Convention, namely: Articles¬†5(3) and¬†6(1) and the first subparagraph of Article¬†17 of the latter, is at the very least similar in substance, if not identical.¬†(¬†[27](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0027)¬†)\n\n36.\n\nIn the fourth place, I would point out that, in accordance with the objectives of the Brussels Convention, which are also those of the Brussels I Regulation, it is necessary, on the one hand, to avoid, as far as possible, multiplication of the bases of jurisdiction in relation to one and the same legal relationship and, on the other hand, to guarantee legal certainty for applicants and defendants alike through the ability to predict with certainty which court has jurisdiction, particularly by allowing the court seised to give a ruling regarding its own jurisdiction without having to examine the substance of the case.¬†(¬†[28](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0028)¬†)\n\n37.\n\nFinally, it appear to me that civil actions for damages resulting from an infringement of competition law are for the most part considered to be a question of tort or delict,¬†(¬†[29](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0029)¬†) although a contractual basis for such actions is not, however, precluded¬†a priori, at least not in some national legal systems.¬†(¬†[30](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0030)¬†)\n\n38.\n\nI therefore intend to start my examination of the problems submitted for the Court‚Äôs scrutiny with the second question referred, relating to Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, which makes provision for a special basis of jurisdiction for civil claims for damages based on tortious liability (B). I shall then examine the first question, relating to Article¬†6(1) of that regulation, which provides for extended jurisdiction in the case of connected claims brought against several defendants (C). Lastly, I shall examine the third question, which relates to those two provisions and to specific aspects of the choice of court, in relation to the principle of full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements and concerted practices under EU law (D).\n\nB¬†‚Äì¬†Interpretation of Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation (second question)\n\n39.\n\nIn essence, the second question invites the Court to give a ruling on the ambit of Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation and on the extent of the jurisdiction which could be derived from the special rule provided for in that provision (1). I consider, bearing in mind in particular the objectives of that provision, that the application of the latter is problematic and ought even to be precluded in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings, whose special characteristics are undeniable (2).\n\n1.¬†The problem submitted to the Court\n\n40.\n\nIn the light of its order for reference, the referring court takes it for granted that the action for damages and disclosure pending before it is a ‚Äòmatter relating to tort or delict‚Äô pursuant to Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation and that its own jurisdiction can therefore be based on that provision. Such a classification of actions of this type has recently been accepted by the Court.¬†(¬†[31](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0031)¬†)\n\n41.\n\nFurthermore, that court rightly points out that settled case-law makes it clear that, in the case of complex tort or delict,¬†(¬†[32](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0032)¬†) the expression ‚Äòplace where the harmful event occurred‚Äô,¬†(¬†[33](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0033)¬†) used in Article¬†5(3), refers both to the¬†place of the causal event¬†giving rise to the alleged damage and to the¬†place where that damage occurred, meaning that the applicant can elect to sue the defendants in the court for either of those two places.¬†(¬†[34](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0034)¬†) It also points out that, when more than one harmful event is alleged, a court having jurisdiction on the basis of the latter connecting factor may, however, rule only on claims regarding harm caused in the territory of the State of the court seised.¬†(¬†[35](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0035)¬†)\n\n42.\n\nThe referring court expresses doubts as to the way in which the alternative criteria so defined by the Court should be given effect in the proceedings before it, given that the contributions of the cartel members which led to an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU and to the alleged damage have the particular feature of differing in both place and time. The court is uncertain, principally, whether Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation permits an action to be brought in every ‚Äòplace where the harmful event occurred‚Äô, within the meaning of that provision, and against every member of the unlawful cartel, in respect of the overall damage caused by that cartel, even when some of the defendants were not directly involved in the territory of the Member State of the court seised.\n\n43.\n\nCDC submits that the Court should reply to the effect that it ought to be possible, pursuant to that provision, for the overall damage suffered as a result of the cartel constituting the infringement to be pleaded before the courts of all the Member States in whose territory at least a part of that cartel agreement was concluded or given effect, or the market concerned was at least partially obstructed, directly and significantly, by that agreement. The Commission adopts a similar approach, but is more guarded concerning the extent of the jurisdiction of the courts that could validly be seised in this respect.¬†(¬†[36](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0036)¬†) Those defendants in the main proceedings that have expressed a view on the second question submit either that the question is inadmissible¬†(¬†[37](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0037)¬†) or, on the merits, that the court should not have overall jurisdiction with respect to all members of the unlawful cartel and for all the damages claimed.¬†(¬†[38](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0038)¬†)\n\n44.\n\nI would point out that, in the light of the Court‚Äôs case-law relating to Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, there are several guiding principles that govern the interpretation of that provision. First, it is settled case-law that the concepts appearing in it are to be interpreted independently, without reference, therefore, to national legal concepts, regard being had primarily to the general scheme and objectives of the regulation, in order to ensure the uniform application of the latter in all the Member States.¬†(¬†[39](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0039)¬†) Next, this provision being a special rule, in that it derogates from the principle of attributing jurisdiction to the courts of the defendant‚Äôs domicile as laid down in Article¬†2 of that regulation, it must be interpreted restrictively, not broadly,¬†(¬†[40](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0040)¬†) in order in particular to prevent the jurisdiction of the¬†forum actoris¬†becoming generalised¬†(¬†[41](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0041)¬†) and to prevent the growth in the number of courts with jurisdiction encouraging ‚Äòforum shopping‚Äô.\n\n45.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to bear in mind that the Court has held, in accordance with the objective of linkage mentioned in recital 12 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation, that the rule governing jurisdiction in Article¬†5(3) is based on the existence of a¬†particularly close connecting factor¬†between the dispute and the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred. It is that connecting factor that justifies the exceptional attribution of jurisdiction to those courts for reasons relating to the sound administration of justice and the efficacious conduct of proceedings.¬†(¬†[42](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0042)¬†) Given that identification of one of the connecting factors recognised by the case-law cited¬†(¬†[43](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0043)¬†) must make it possible to establish the jurisdiction of the court objectively best placed to determine whether the elements that constitute the liability of the person sued do in fact exist, it follows that only the court within whose jurisdiction the relevant connecting factor is situated may validly be seised.¬†(¬†[44](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0044)¬†)\n\n46.\n\nIt is precisely that connection that could be wanting, in the view of the referring court, if in this case it were to be held that, under Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, any court situated in any one of the many places in which the cartel agreement was conceived, arranged and monitored and in which purchasers‚Äô freedom of choice was limited on the relevant market could have jurisdiction in respect of all the defendants sued and all the alleged damage.¬†(¬†[45](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0045)¬†) I share its point of view for the following reasons.\n\n2.¬†Giving effect to the criteria governing the application of Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation in a case such as that in the main proceedings\n\n47.\n\nAlthough application of Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation in the context of an action for damages relating to an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU cannot be excluded¬†in principle,¬†(¬†[46](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0046)¬†) I am none the less inclined to the view that that provision cannot properly be applied in the¬†particular case¬†of a horizontal cartel, which has existed for a long time and has restricted competition throughout Union territory and whose structure is highly complex, since it has given rise to a series of agreements and collusive practices, with the result that both the participants in the cartel and the persons sustaining the alleged damage are scattered over a great many Member States.¬†(¬†[47](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0047)¬†)\n\n48.\n\nIn circumstances such as those obtaining in this case, the criteria laid down in the case-law for determining ‚Äòthe place where the harmful event occurred‚Äô, within the meaning of that provision, are in my view ineffective, due to the considerable geographical dispersal of the causes and effects of the harm invoked. The two aspects of the alternative identified by the Court lead, in this case, to jurisdiction potentially being conferred on a multitude of courts in the Member States, whereas the regulation seeks to limit the number of concurrent proceedings,¬†(¬†[48](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0048)¬†) and do not enable the identification of a court that has a ‚Äòparticularly close link‚Äô with the dispute and is therefore the ‚Äòbest placed‚Äôratione loci¬†to decide the case, whereas that is the basis of Article¬†5(3).\n\n49.\n\nAs regards the criterion relating to the place of the event giving rise to the alleged damage, this could theoretically refer to any place in which the unlawful cartel agreement was entered into by its members, a place which it could be difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint in view of the secret nature of the cartel, unless the various places where the registered offices of the companies concerned are situated are taken into account. That criterion could also relate to all the places where the unlawful agreement was actually put into effect, in other words, every one of the places where the participants actually organised and applied the rules of their collusive agreements aimed at restricting competition, through active anti-competitive practices or inaction.¬†(¬†[49](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0049)¬†) In this connection, I consider, unlike the Commission, that¬†Melzer,¬†(¬†[50](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0050)¬†) which excluded the possibility of basing jurisdiction on the place where the harmful event was committed by a co-perpetrator who had not been sued, should lead to the impossibility of attributing the activities of a member of a cartel in the territory of a Member State to other perpetrators of the infringement who refrained from competing freely on the corresponding market in that territory.¬†(¬†[51](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0051)¬†) At all events, in the context of a cartel of long duration at European level, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, these locating factors seem to me to be irrelevant in that they lead to over-generous, too diffuse and fortuitous grounds of jurisdiction,¬†(¬†[52](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0052)¬†) given the large numbers of parties involved and of actions or omissions concerned and, hence, the multiplicity of places where the corresponding harmful facts occurred.¬†(¬†[53](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0053)¬†)\n\n50.\n\nWith regard to the criterion relating to the place where the alleged damage occurred, it may be considered, from an economic point of view, that the damage occurred either in every one of the places where the persons allegedly adversely affected bought the products covered by the cartel agreement, in other words, the places of signature and/or performance of the contracts whose content was limited by the cartel¬†‚Äî in this case the supply contracts between the defendants and the undertakings which transferred their rights to the applicant¬†‚Äî or in every one of the places where those persons affected or their branches have their registered office. The persons indirectly injured, who were not contractually bound to a member of the cartel but who were nevertheless harmed by the existence of the latter,¬†(¬†[54](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0054)¬†) ought also to be able to invoke the harm caused to them, within the limits laid down by the case-law of this Court.¬†(¬†[55](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0055)¬†) It should, however, be recalled that the choice of jurisdiction available in the case of tort or delict is not to be interpreted in such a way as to allow a¬†forum actoris, because the Brussels I Regulation tends to restrict the latter factor of jurisdiction in order to preserve the effectiveness of the general rule in Article¬†2.¬†(¬†[56](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0056)¬†) Moreover, account could to advantage be taken of all the places where the market has been affected by the infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU, given that the purpose of the rules of competition law is to safeguard the proper functioning of economic activity, and not to protect the individual interests of a particular company.¬†(¬†[57](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0057)¬†) In this case, the infringement on which the action for damages is based affects the territories of all the Member States of the Union, which means that a large number of courts could possibly have jurisdiction.¬†(¬†[58](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0058)¬†) Such a broad approach conflicts with the objectives of the Brussels I Regulation, mentioned above, and particularly with those in Article¬†5(3) thereof. I would also add that the case-law in¬†Shevill and Others¬†(¬†[59](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0059)¬†) implies a point which it is, in my view, neither feasible nor desirable to alter, namely, that jurisdiction based on the place where the harmful event occurred is divided territorially, according to the borders of the Member States,¬†(¬†[60](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0060)¬†) with the associated risk of an explosion of litigation because the court having jurisdiction by virtue of that criterion cannot cover all the multiple instances of damage pleaded.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, I would stress that, if the Court were to hold that a multiplicity of courts had jurisdiction in this case under Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, the possibilities offered to citizens seeking legal redress on that basis would be very significantly opened up, whereas this is a choice of jurisdiction of a special nature, and must, therefore, in principle be interpreted strictly. In addition, there would then be a¬†‚Äî far from hypothetical¬†(¬†[61](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0061)¬†)¬†‚Äî danger that the perpetrators of an infringement of EU competition law would be enabled to bring ‚Äòtorpedo actions‚Äô, in the form of actions for a negative declaration, in accordance with¬†Folien Fischer and Fofitec,¬†(¬†[62](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0062)¬†) in a Member State in which proceedings were known to be particularly drawn out, against persons who had been identified as injured parties in the administrative proceedings before the Commission. By contrast, once a Commission decision concerning the existence of an infringement has been given, it ought, in my opinion, no longer to be possible for an action for a negative declaration to be brought, by reason of the binding effect of the Commission decision as to the facts and their legal classification.¬†(¬†[63](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0063)¬†)\n\n52.\n\nIn conclusion, by analogy with the Court‚Äôs ruling in¬†Besix,¬†(¬†[64](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0064)¬†) I consider that the special jurisdiction rule in matters of tort, delict or quasi-delict, laid down in Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, is inoperative when, as in the case in the main proceedings, the place where the harmful event allegedly occurred cannot be determined, by virtue of the fact that the infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU on which the action is based consists of actions notable for the multiplicity of places where they were agreed and/or performed, with the result that it is not possible to determine clearly and usefully what court has a particularly close link with the dispute as a whole.\n\n53.\n\nIn my opinion, in such a case jurisdiction must be determined either by applying the general rule in Article¬†2(1) of the Brussels I Regulation or by applying other special jurisdiction rules specified in that regulation, such as the rule in Article¬†6(1), which allows actions brought against several defendants to be combined before a single court, provided that the conditions for applying one or other of those rules are satisfied in the case in point. In that connection, it must be pointed out that it is possible for account to be taken of the connection between actions against several defendants, as a basis for establishing jurisdiction, only in the context of Article¬†6(1),¬†(¬†[65](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0065)¬†) which provides for that possibility solely where there is the strong connecting link of the domicile of one of the defendants, but not in the context of a provision such as Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation whose application depends on the place where an event occurred.\n\nC¬†‚Äì¬†Interpretation of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation (first question)\n\n54.\n\nBy its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the rule on centralisation of jurisdiction in the case of several defendants, as provided for in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, can apply in the case of an action against undertakings which have participated differently, in terms of place and time, in a single continuous infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in EU law (1). It then asks the Court to rule whether, in the case of an affirmative reply, the withdrawal of such an action with respect to the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô, in other words, the only one of the co-defendants to be domiciled in the Member State of the court seised, impinges on the jurisdiction of the latter under that provision (2).\n\n1.¬†The applicability of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in a case such as that in the main proceedings [question 1(a)]\n\na)¬†The problem raised before the Court\n\n55.\n\nIt must be emphasised that, as with Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation,¬†(¬†[66](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0066)¬†) the tenor of Article¬†6(1) of that regulation must be determined independently, so that the concepts appearing in it may not be interpreted as making a reference to the classification that the domestic law applicable gives to the legal relationship at issue before the court seised.¬†(¬†[67](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0067)¬†)\n\n56.\n\nIn accordance with Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, all the claims on the part of a single applicant against a number of defendants may be brought before a court of a Member State in whose jurisdiction at least one of those defendants, who will be referred to here as the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô, is domiciled,¬†(¬†[68](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0068)¬†) provided always that there is a connecting link between those heads of claim.¬†(¬†[69](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0069)¬†) In this regard, the relevant provision expressly states that the claims must be ‚Äòso closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings‚Äô.¬†(¬†[70](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0070)¬†)\n\n57.\n\nBy allowing actions to be centralised before a single court and by extending the jurisdiction of the latter to cover defendants vis-√†-vis whom the court would not have been able to give a ruling failing that extension, Article¬†6(1) reflects the objectives of sound administration of justice, by eliminating unnecessary proceedings and preventing the concomitant risk of concurrent proceedings and conflicting decisions, as referred to in the Brussels I Regulation.¬†(¬†[71](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0071)¬†)\n\n58.\n\nHowever, because that rule of jurisdiction is of a special nature, in that it derogates from the principle of the court for the domicile of each defendant mentioned in recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation and set out in Article¬†2 thereof, it is settled case-law that it is to be interpreted strictly.¬†(¬†[72](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0072)¬†)\n\n59.\n\nBecause the application of Article¬†6(1) must thus remain exceptional, the joining of cases for which it provides is permitted only if those cases do not refer to a single insured person, consumer or worker¬†(¬†[73](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0073)¬†) and only if they relate solely to claims that, while distinct, are none the less closely connected.\n\n60.\n\nIt is to this latter condition that the first part of the first question in essence relates. It invites the Court to declare whether this connecting factor is to be found in the context of an action such as that before the referring court, namely, an action for disclosure and damages brought jointly and severally against the co-perpetrators of a cartel agreement declared to be in breach of EU law which participated in that cartel in different places and at different times.\n\n61.\n\nThose interested parties that have lodged written observations on this matter have differing views, for CDC and the Commission consider that Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is applicable in this context, whereas the defendants in the main proceedings maintain the contrary.¬†(¬†[74](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0074)¬†)\n\n62.\n\nIt follows from the Court‚Äôs case-law concerning the connecting factor required by that provision that, in order for decisions to be regarded as ‚Äòirreconcilable‚Äô, it is not sufficient that there be a divergence in the outcome of the dispute; it is necessary too that that divergence arise in the context of the same situation of fact and law.¬†(¬†[75](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0075)¬†) The attempt to establish these two criteria in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings has led to contrasting observations being submitted to the Court.\n\nb)¬†Existence of the same factual situation\n\n63.\n\nIn the view of the defendants in the main proceedings, the claims relied upon in the application in those proceedings do not satisfy the criterion of a situation that is identical¬†de facto, on the grounds that it is irrelevant whether the members of the unlawful cartel all participated in the agreements setting up the cartel, because only the implementation of those agreements could actually have caused damage to the purchasers which transferred their rights to CDC, and that it is necessary for every claim made by the applicant on that basis to be examined separately.\n\n64.\n\nIn this connection, I am of the opposite view, put forward by the referring court, CDC and the Commission, to the effect that claims such as those made against the various defendants in the main proceedings relate to a single situation of fact, even though the defendants participated in different ways, in different places and at different times, according to the referring court, in the performance of the agreement in question and in the conclusion and performance of the various contracts distorted by that agreement that allegedly harmed the undertakings having transferred their rights to the applicant in the main proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nAs the referring court points out, the Commission decision on which the claims are based found, in terms binding on the courts of the Member States,¬†(¬†[76](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0076)¬†) that a¬†single and continuous infringement¬†of Article¬†81 EC (Article¬†101 TFEU) and Article¬†53 of the EEA Agreement had been committed by the companies sued by CDC and that the conduct in which the other co-participants had engaged could be attributed to every participant as a co-offender, irrespective of its own individual contribution.¬†(¬†[77](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0077)¬†) It adds, quite correctly in my view, that the conduct established in the administrative fine proceedings renders every author of the infringement liable for damages, in civil law, for the tortious conduct of the co-authors and, therefore, for any loss or harm liable to result from that conduct.\n\nc)¬†Existence of the same situation in law\n\n66.\n\nThe Court has already ruled, in the light of the wording of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, that a difference in the legal bases of actions brought against different defendants is not in itself an obstacle to the application of that provision, always provided, however, that the defendants could foresee that they risked being sued in the Member State where at least one of them had its domicile.¬†(¬†[78](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0078)¬†)\n\n67.\n\nIn this case, the participants in a cartel agreement, established in a single Commission decision and constituting¬†a single infringement¬†of¬†EU¬†competition law, not committed at the level of various domestic legal orders, find themselves in the same legal situation, in other words, they are confronted with an obligation to pay compensation under EU law derived from the Court‚Äôs consistent case-law. Thus, they could reasonably expect subsequently to be sued together for compensation before the court for the place where one of them was domiciled. In such circumstances, the principle of the predictability of jurisdiction, laid down by the Court in accordance with the objective expressed in recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation, has therefore been observed.\n\n68.\n\nMoreover, it is worth emphasising that in¬†Kalfelis, which introduced the requirement of a connecting link between actions which could be joined under that provision, the Court referred to the Jenard Report, according to which ‚Äò[i]n order for this rule [laid down in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels Convention] to be applicable, there must be a connection between the claims made against each of the defendants, as¬†for example¬†in the case of¬†joint debtors‚Äô.¬†(¬†[79](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0079)¬†) This is precisely the situation in the dispute in the main proceedings according to the referring court, despite the fact that that classification as jointly liable perpetrators is disputed by some of the defendants.\n\n69.\n\nI consider that the mere possibility of joint liability in the case of multiple perpetrators being invoked in one of the relevant Member States, and not in others, is sufficient to create a risk of different and mutually irreconcilable judgments, within the meaning of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation. In the legal order of that Member State, the liability of each of the defendants could theoretically be extended to include all the damage caused, whereas in the legal systems of the Member States where joint liability would not be countenanced, the level of the damages awarded would be likely to vary considerably, depending on the courts seised. Even in the contrary hypothesis, if that joint liability were accepted in all the relevant Member States, the risk of irreconcilable judgments being given if the claims were judged separately would still exist as regards the apportionment of liability between the members of the cartel, depending on whether they were involved for all or only some of the period concerned.\n\n70.\n\nIn this connection, it may be noted that, in the light of the indications given by the Commission in its observations, the joint and several liability of the participants for a common infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article¬†101 TFEU appears to be a principle generally accepted in the legal systems of the Member States¬†(¬†[80](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0080)¬†) and that it has been upheld in, inter alia, the relevant directive, which has recently been adopted.¬†(¬†[81](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0081)¬†)\n\n71.\n\nI would emphasise that, if it were to be held that Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation was not applicable to proceedings such as the main proceedings in this case, that would mean that different courts would have to examine the alleged damage, without any consultation, in the light of the various domestic legal orders,¬†(¬†[82](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0082)¬†) with the attendant risk that each of the participants in the same unlawful cartel might be ordered to pay different amounts of damages, when it would be desirable, not to say necessary, to rule uniformly on the claims submitted by the same applicant.¬†(¬†[83](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0083)¬†)\n\n72.\n\nAs the Commission points out, in my view rightly, ‚Äòthe effectiveness of this provision would be undermined if it were to be interpreted so strictly that it would render impossible, in such circumstances, the bringing of joint actions against all the participants in a cartel before a court which is situated in the domicile of one of the defendants belonging to the cartel, on the sole grounds that it lacked international jurisdiction‚Äô.\n\n73.\n\nIn the light of these factors, I consider that a situation in which several companies established in different Member States are tried separately, before different courts, and not before a single court, for the purpose of obtaining damages in respect of the same infringement of EU competition law, resulting from acts committed at different times and in different places but constituting a single and continuous infringement, is liable to lead to irreconcilable judgments, within the meaning of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, if the cases are judged separately.\n\n74.\n\nIn accordance with the Court‚Äôs case-law, it will be for the referring court to assess, in the light of all the elements in the case, whether there exists such a risk in the proceedings before it.¬†(¬†[84](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0084)¬†)\n\n75.\n\nLike the Commission, I note that such an interpretation has the not inconsiderable advantage of reflecting the intention expressed by the legislature in the Rome II Regulation, especially in Article¬†6 entitled ‚ÄòUnfair competition and acts restricting free competition‚Äô, paragraph¬†3 of which sets out the possibility, for a claimant suing several defendants in the context of a dispute in this field, of centralising his claims before a single court ‚Äòin accordance with the applicable rules on jurisdiction‚Äô and of basing his claims on the law of that court.¬†(¬†[85](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0085)¬†) To my mind, due account should be taken of this legal guideline, in the interests of coherence between the instruments of Union law applicable to cross-border disputes,¬†(¬†[86](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0086)¬†) despite the fact that, as the defendants in the main proceedings contend, the Rome II Regulation is not,¬†ratione temporis, applicable in this case.¬†(¬†[87](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0087)¬†)\n\n2.¬†The effect, for the purposes of applying Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, of withdrawal of the action against the sole co-defendant established in the State of the court seised [part (b) of the first question]\n\n76.\n\nIn the second part of its first question referred for a preliminary ruling, the referring court identifies two problems of interpretation concerning Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of withdrawal of the action against the ‚Äòanchor co-defendant‚Äô, namely, (a) the possible application of the principle¬†perpetuatio fori¬†(¬†[88](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0088)¬†) on the basis of that provision in such a situation, on the one hand, and¬†(b) the inferences to be drawn from a possible abuse of the right to rely on a connecting link on that basis, on the other hand.\n\n77.\n\nThe answers suggested by the interested parties having lodged observations on these two problems differ most markedly, but it may be noted briefly that the defendants in the main proceedings maintain that the extension of jurisdiction provided for in Article¬†6(1) ought not to continue in such circumstances,¬†(¬†[89](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0089)¬†) contrary to the view taken by CDC and the Commission, albeit with several nuances in the case of the latter.\n\na)¬†Maintenance of jurisdiction based on Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of withdrawal of the action against the anchor defendant\n\n78.\n\nI share the opinion of the referring court, CDC and the Commission that, provided that a connecting link between the claims made against several defendants had been established at the time the action was brought, subsequent withdrawal of the action against the defendant justifying the extended jurisdiction of the court seised, under Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, is not to have the effect of terminating that jurisdiction.\n\n79.\n\nThe Court has, it is true, not yet had occasion to give a direct ruling on this problem. However, it should be noted that, in the judgment in¬†Reisch Montage, the Court stressed that Article¬†6(1) makes no reference to the application of domestic rules, which may not therefore stand in the way of the application of that provision, and held that the provision in question must apply ‚Äòeven when that action is regarded under a national provision as inadmissible,¬†from the time it is brought, against the ‚Ä¶ defendant [domiciled in the Member State of the court seised]‚Äô.¬†(¬†[90](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0090)¬†) Furthermore, in its judgment in¬†Freeport, the Court expressly identified the bringing of the action as the reference point for determining whether claims are connected.¬†(¬†[91](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0091)¬†)\n\n80.\n\nThe criterion that appears to me to be decisive, if the effectiveness of the derived jurisdiction under Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is to remain valid, is that the claim against the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô should be withdrawn only after the court concerned has been seised in accordance with the requisite procedural conditions.¬†(¬†[92](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0092)¬†) Given that the bringing of proceedings was effective by that date it is, however, of no consequence, in my view, whether the withdrawal took place, as in this case, before the expiry of the period fixed by the court for a defence to be lodged and the start of the first hearing.\n\n81.\n\nIt is to be recalled in this connection that Article¬†30 of the Brussels I Regulation defines the time by which a court of a Member State is deemed to be seised, for the purpose of applying the provisions of Article¬†9 regarding¬†lis pendens¬†and related actions.¬†(¬†[93](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0093)¬†) In my view, that definition may also be taken into account with regard to the other sections of Chapter II relating to competition rules, and indeed must be, in relation to Article¬†6(1), because the latter establishes a rule also based on connexity between claims.¬†(¬†[94](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0094)¬†)\n\n82.\n\nIn addition, maintaining the grouping together of connected claims before the court seised, made possible by Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, is consistent with the objectives of sound administration of justice, predictability and legal certainty which underpin the jurisdiction rules in this regulation,¬†(¬†[95](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0095)¬†) because that maintenance makes it possible to prevent irreconcilable judgments being given, at least vis-√†-vis the remaining defendants, which already knew, moreover, that they were all being sued before that court at the time of the withdrawal in question.\n\n83.\n\nI consider, therefore, that the fact that the applicant withdrew its action against the only co-defendant domiciled in the jurisdiction of the court seised does not in itself affect jurisdiction on the basis of Article¬†6(1), when that withdrawal is made after the date on which the court was validly seised, provided that a further condition, which I shall go on to examine, is also satisfied.\n\nb)¬†Limit resulting from an abuse of the right to base jurisdiction on Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n84.\n\nIn accordance with the Court‚Äôs consistent case-law, ‚Äòthe rule [on jurisdiction laid down in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation] cannot be interpreted in such a way as to allow a plaintiff to make a claim against a number of defendants for¬†the sole purpose of removing¬†one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled‚Äô.¬†(¬†[96](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0096)¬†) This restriction concerning a potential ousting of jurisdiction of the court seised, which was supported in the Jenard Report¬†(¬†[97](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0097)¬†) is perfectly consistent with the requirement that derogations from the jurisdiction in principle of the courts for the place of a defendant‚Äôs domicile, laid down in Article¬†2 of the Brussels I Regulation, should be interpreted restrictively.\n\n85.\n\nIn¬†Freeport, the Court indicated that ‚Äòwhere claims brought against different defendants are connected when the proceedings are instituted‚Äô, the rule on jurisdiction laid down in Article¬†6(1) is applicable ‚Äòwithout there being any further need to establish separately¬†that the claims were¬†not brought with the sole object¬†of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where one of the defendants is domiciled‚Äô.¬†(¬†[98](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0098)¬†) The issue of the consequences to be drawn from that somewhat ambiguous wording creates a problem for the referring court and divides both the parties to this case and also the legal writers who have commented on that judgment.¬†(¬†[99](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0099)¬†)\n\n86.\n\nIn this connection, the analysis of the referring court appears to be correct, in that it considers that, when the condition relating to the existence of a connecting factor between claims is satisfied, for the purposes of that provision, the court seised is not obliged to examine systematically whether the extended jurisdiction deriving from the latter provision resulted from an abuse of rights, although it may nevertheless do so if there is sufficient evidence that the applicant availing itself of the extended jurisdiction has so conducted itself as to distort the true purpose of that rule of jurisdiction .\n\n87.\n\nIn this case, the referring court points to probable collusion between the applicant in the main proceedings and Evonik Degussa, the defendant in the main proceedings domiciled in Germany, which, it appears, deliberately delayed the formal conclusion of their out-of-court settlement until after proceedings had been instituted, although an agreement would have been envisaged, if not decided upon, well before, for the sole purpose of establishing extended jurisdiction in that Member State.¬†(¬†[100](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0100)¬†)\n\n88.\n\nProvided that the deceitful tactics alleged, disputed in this case by the parties concerned, are not just probable but confirmed, which it will be for the national court to establish, such an abuse of rights, which is designed to deprive one or more of the defendants of the general jurisdiction as a rule of the court for the place where they are domiciled,¬†(¬†[101](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0101)¬†) ought in my view to be penalised by refusal to apply Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation in those circumstances, given that the criteria relating to connecting factors were not truly satisfied at the time the action was brought.¬†(¬†[102](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0102)¬†) The advantage of its being the court for the domicile of the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô that examines and tries the claims against several defendants at the same time, in accordance with that provision, disappeared as soon as a binding transaction put an end, vis-√†-vis that defendant, to the legal obligation that the applicant could have relied upon against it before that court. Apart from these specific cases, there is, on the other hand, no need in my view to examine and penalise an abuse of rights in a legal context of this nature.\n\n89.\n\nI would point out that the existence of a connecting factor required under Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation provides an option for the applicant, to whom, in my opinion and in accordance with the Opinions of Advocates General Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer and Mengozzi on the subject of ‚Äòforum shopping‚Äô, it is open to exercise that option in the manner he considers most suitable and advantageous, and this need not necessarily amount to depriving the proper court of its jurisdiction.¬†(¬†[103](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0103)¬†) Furthermore, in the case of unlawful agreements such as that in the main proceedings, the application of that provision could, by definition, given its object, lead to one or more defendants having to answer for their conduct before a court other than that of their domicile, and in consequence an objection based on that actual outcome would be irrelevant.\n\n90.\n\nIn the light of all those matters, I consider that the rule on extended jurisdiction in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation is not to apply when it has been properly established, according to the court seised, that the applicant had entered into a legally binding transaction with the defendant domiciled in the Member State of the court seised before bringing its action and that it had knowingly concealed the existence of that earlier agreement, for the sole purpose of depriving one of the other defendants of the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that other defendant is domiciled.\n\nD¬†‚Äì¬†Possible application of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in a dispute such as that forming the subject-matter of the main proceedings (third question)\n\n91.\n\nThe third question, the reasoning of which is, alas, somewhat laconic, asks the Court to rule whether, having regard to the principle laid down by the Court of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article¬†101 TFEU and guaranteed by the right of persons injured to claim damages for harm suffered in that connection,¬†(¬†[104](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0104)¬†) it would be permissible, in this case, to derogate from the rules on jurisdiction in Articles¬†5(3) and/or 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation as a result of the action of arbitration and/or jurisdiction clauses (1).\n\n92.\n\nGiven that the latter type of clause falls within the scope of Article¬†23 of that regulation, unlike arbitration clauses, it is necessary to consider the impact of that provision in this context (2). Moreover, even if the referring court starts a priori from the premise that the two categories of clause invoked by the defendants in the main proceedings can be applicable in the context of an action for damages, as in the main proceedings,¬†(¬†[105](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0105)¬†) which is, in my view, debatable (4), it will in any case be necessary to examine whether, and if so to what extent, such clauses can produce their effects when the content of the contracts in which they appear has been compromised by the unlawful agreement in question (3).\n\n1.¬†The problem put before the Court\n\n93.\n\nFor the purpose of disputing the jurisdiction of the Landgericht Dortmund, the defendants in the main action have objected that there were arbitration and jurisdiction clauses in some of the supply contracts entered into between the hydrogen peroxide buyers having transferred their rights to CDC and the suppliers having taken part in the unlawful agreement on which CDC‚Äôs claims for damages are based.\n\n94.\n\nThe decision for reference does not contain a detailed description of the clauses in question. However, it is apparent from the observations of CDC that, according to the contentions of the defendants in the main action, some of those supply contracts did contain such clauses, either in the form of general conditions relating to a specific contract,¬†(¬†[106](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0106)¬†) or in framework contracts covering several deliveries to a customer over a period other than the period of the cartel,¬†(¬†[107](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0107)¬†) it being indicated that certain customers had concluded several clauses with different suppliers¬†(¬†[108](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0108)¬†) or different clauses in the various contracts with the same suppliers.¬†(¬†[109](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0109)¬†) The question whether the jurisdiction clauses invoked designated courts of the Member States only, or courts of third States too, is not clearly established.\n\n95.\n\nAs set out in the grounds for the third question put forward by the referring court, the latter considers that if the clauses did cover the claims for damages at issue, which it is for that court alone to determine,¬†(¬†[110](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0110)¬†) the question would then arise whether the principle of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices under EU law precludes the application of such clauses when the court hearing an action of this kind has jurisdiction by virtue of Articles¬†6(1) and/or 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n96.\n\nOf the interested parties having submitted observations to the Court, only CDC claims that those clauses ought not to be taken into account in such a context. The Commission stresses that, in order to resolve the preliminary question whether an arbitration or jurisdiction clause actually covers rights to compensation such as those at issue, the national court will need to consider the fact that those rights do not arise from the supply contracts in question but from the infringement constituted by the cartel agreement, which is not germane to those contracts.\n\n97.\n\nBefore expressing my opinion on this issue, I should wish to offer clarification of a few points that are, to my way of thinking, important. In the first place, it must be recalled that choice of jurisdiction clauses, under which the parties, at least one of which had its domicile in the territory of a Member State, have designated a court of a Member State to hear and determine disputes arising or likely to arise out of a particular legal relationship, fall within the ambit of Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n98.\n\nOn the other hand, arbitration clauses are, as a matter of principle, excluded from the scope of that regulation.¬†(¬†[111](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0111)¬†) It follows that questions relating to the validity of, and the possibility of relying on, those clauses ought to be governed by the national law of each of the Member States and by the international conventions binding the latter.¬†(¬†[112](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0112)¬†) Nevertheless, the Court has held that if, because of the main subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, the nature of the rights to be protected in proceedings, such as a claim for damages, the proceedings brought before a national court fall within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation, then an incidental preliminary issue concerning the applicability of an arbitration agreement, including its validity, falls within the scope of that regulation too and it is, therefore, exclusively for that court to rule on the objection of lack of jurisdiction based on the existence of an arbitration agreement and on its own jurisdiction under the provisions of that regulation.¬†(¬†[113](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0113)¬†)\n\n99.\n\nDespite this difference in terms of the applicability of the Brussels I Regulation, it must be recalled that the two categories of clause at issue have the common effect of¬†derogating from the rules on jurisdiction laid down in that regulation, by reason of respect for the autonomy of the parties concerning the determination of the court, whether national or arbitral as the case may be, to which they mean to entrust the task of settling their disputes.¬†(¬†[114](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0114)¬†)\n\n100.\n\nNevertheless, a clause conferring jurisdiction in accordance with Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation may confer jurisdiction only on the courts of Member States of the European Union and by extension, under the Lugano Convention,¬†(¬†[115](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0115)¬†) on the courts of the Parties to that Convention, whereas an arbitration clause may provide that arbitration is to take place in any third State whatsoever. The likelihood of provisions of EU competition law not being applied, even by way of public policy rules, is much greater when jurisdiction is conferred on arbitrators or courts of States not bound by the Lugano Convention.¬†(¬†[116](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0116)¬†)\n\n101.\n\nIn the second place, I would emphasise that the interplay between jurisdiction and arbitration clauses, on the one hand, and provisions of EU competition law, on the other, is complex because the legal context of barriers to the free competition affirmed in those provisions offers a wide variety of possible configurations. More specifically, regarding the right to full compensation based on Article¬†101 TFEU, I recall that it is not always easy to classify the liability of the author of an infringement of that provision as being of a contractual or tortious nature and that there are differences in this regard between the legal systems of the Member States.¬†(¬†[117](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0117)¬†)\n\n102.\n\nThe existence of various contractual links between the members of the cartel and the persons injured by such an infringement raises the problem of ascertaining whether the clauses concerned can permit derogation, in the present case, from the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State which is based on Articles¬†5 or¬†6 of the Brussels I Regulation, despite the fact that the content of the contracts containing those clauses is affected by the infringement at issue.\n\n103.\n\nGiven that it is for the national court to determine the substantive scope of such clauses,¬†(¬†[118](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0118)¬†) the third question asks the Court, in essence, to determine whether, and if so how, the principles inherent in Article¬†101 TFEU could influence, first, the application of Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation in the case of the jurisdiction clauses covered by the latter and, next, the implementation of other types of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses governed by rules belonging to the law of the Member States.\n\n2.¬†Ousting of the rules on jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and¬†6 of the Brussels I Regulation by jurisdiction clauses consistent with Article¬†23 of that regulation\n\n104.\n\nIt is, first of all, to be noted that compensation for damage caused by an unlawful agreement, such as that sought by the applicant in the main proceedings, is governed in general terms by the independent decisions of the parties, in that it is a civil-law obligation incumbent on any person having committed an unlawful act that he should make financial reparation for the harm caused to another person, a field in which the substantive rights of the parties concerned are not unavailable.¬†(¬†[119](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0119)¬†) Likewise, the Brussels I Regulation does not prevent parties from conferring jurisdiction¬†ratione loci¬†(¬†[120](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0120)¬†) on a court of a Member State in the context of a dispute relating to such a matter in accordance with Article¬†23 of that regulation.\n\n105.\n\nAs regards the interplay between the provisions of the latter article and those of Articles¬†5(3) and/or 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, Kemira correctly states that the Court has previously held that, by concluding an agreement on the choice of court under Article¬†17 of the Brussels Convention, the parties might derogate, not only from the general jurisdiction under Article¬†2 thereof, but also from the special jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and¬†6.¬†(¬†[121](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0121)¬†) The Court has held, on the one hand, that ‚Äòthis interpretation is justified on the ground that Article¬†17 is based on a recognition of the independent will of the parties to a contract in deciding which courts are to have jurisdiction to settle disputes falling within the scope of the Convention, other than those which are expressly excluded pursuant to the second paragraph of Article¬†17‚Äô and, on the other hand, that ‚Äòsuch an agreement ‚Ä¶ is nevertheless effective in that it excludes, in relations between the parties, other optional attributions of jurisdiction, such as those detailed in Articles¬†5 and¬†6 of the [Brussels] Convention‚Äô.¬†(¬†[122](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0122)¬†)\n\n106.\n\nThe same applies to the equivalent provisions of the Brussels I Regulation, given that, according to recitals 11 and¬†14 in the preamble and Article¬†23(5), ‚Äòthe autonomy of the parties to a contract ‚Ä¶ to determine the courts having jurisdiction ‚Ä¶ must be respected‚Äô, except where either special jurisdiction rules designed to protect the weaker party¬†(¬†[123](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0123)¬†) or the special jurisdiction rules in Article¬†22 are applicable. Apart from provisions whose application is expressly reserved in this way, which do not include Articles¬†5 and¬†6 of that regulation, an agreement conferring jurisdiction pursuant to Article¬†23 must be fully effective and must, in particular, confer exclusive jurisdiction on the court chosen.\n\n107.\n\nThat prevailing of the will of the parties applies, in particular, in relation to the objectives of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation concerning centralisation of jurisdiction and procedural efficiency and, in my view, even though that clause does not expressly state that the parties intended to derogate from that specific provision.\n\n108.\n\nRegarding Article¬†5(3) of that regulation, it must be determined, beforehand, whether a clause conferring jurisdiction can really apply in a dispute such as that forming the subject of the main proceedings, which appears to me to relate to matters of tort rather than of contract,¬†(¬†[124](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0124)¬†) and whether it may be relied upon against an applicant such as CDC, as a result of a substitution in the obligations entered into by the undertakings having transferred their rights to CDC,¬†(¬†[125](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0125)¬†) which it will be for the referring court to ascertain following the relevant guidelines provided by the Court.\n\n109.\n#addthis #important \nI would, in particular, recall that it follows from the Court‚Äôs case-law in relation to Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation, on the one hand, that the validity of a jurisdiction clause inserted in a contract is dependent on the parties that concluded it having clearly indicated their agreement to that clause and, on the other hand, that the court seised is required to examine whether that clause was the subject of consensus between the parties.¬†(¬†[126](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0126)¬†)\n\n110.\n\nFurthermore, according to that article, an agreement as to the choice of court can apply only to disputes that have arisen or are likely to arise ‚Äòin connection with a particular legal relationship‚Äô. Having interpreted that criterion in relation to Article¬†17 of the Brussels Convention, the Court held that ‚Äò[t]hat requirement is intended to limit the scope of an agreement conferring jurisdiction solely to disputes which arise from the legal relationship in connection with which the agreement was entered into. Its purpose is to avoid a party being taken by surprise by the assignment of jurisdiction to a given forum as regards all disputes which may arise out of its relationship with the other party to the contract and stem from a relationship other than that in connection with which the agreement conferring jurisdiction was made‚Äô.¬†(¬†[127](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0127)¬†)\n\n111.\n\nLike CDC, I very much doubt that a clause conferring jurisdiction, included in contracts such as those at issue, could satisfy the requirement of clear unvitiated consensus, because the point is the attribution of jurisdiction to the court designated to settle a case relating to the tortious liability of one of the contracting parties deriving from an unlawful cartel when, at the time it concluded the agreement, the person allegedly injured was unaware of the existence of the cartel.\n\n112.\n\nOn the other hand, it could, to my mind, be accepted that the person injured should enter into an agreement conferring jurisdiction after it had learned of the existence of the unlawful cartel agreement prohibited by Article¬†101 TFEU, the former agreement being entered into after the dispute arose, and hence accepted in full knowledge of the facts.\n\n113.\n\nIn this connection, I would stress that Directive 2014/104, mentioned above, which relates to actions for damages under national law for infringements of EU competition law, is intended in particular to promote recourse to consensual dispute resolution mechanisms, such as out-of-court settlements and arbitration, and to increase their effectiveness.¬†(¬†[128](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0128)¬†) This approach appears to me well-founded, in that the parties have fully and freely consented to attribute the matter of claims for damages arising from an unlawful cartel agreement to a particular court, even if that is not the court that would have jurisdiction under Articles¬†5(3) and¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n114.\n\nWhatever the analysis that the referring court will make of those latter points, I consider that there are no grounds for the principle, mentioned in the third preliminary question, of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article¬†101 TFEU, to interfere in the particular case of jurisdiction clauses covered by Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n115.\n\nWith regard to such a clause, it is not national rules but the provisions of that article that determine, in EU law, the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States in civil and commercial matters, by laying down the conditions governing the validity and legal effects of that clause.¬†(¬†[129](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0129)¬†) The foregoing considerations concerning the judicial interpretation of Article¬†23¬†(¬†[130](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0130)¬†) clearly lead to clauses compatible with the requirements of that article particularly as regards the consent of the person allegedly harmed by the unlawful cartel agreement, taking precedence over the bases of jurisdiction resulting from Articles¬†5 and/or 6 of the regulation.\n\n116.\n\nI would add that mutual trust between the courts of the Member States, which is one of the pillars of the system of judicial cooperation established by the Brussels Convention and taken up in the Brussels I Regulation,¬†(¬†[131](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0131)¬†) implies, in my view, that the jurisdiction of the court chosen by the parties in accordance with Article¬†23 of that regulation is not to be frustrated on the basis of Article¬†101 TFEU, in the same way as the Court has held that considerations of public policy may not be relied upon in order to contest the enforcement of a judgment given in another Member State on the grounds that EU competition law was incorrectly applied therein to the substance of the case.¬†(¬†[132](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0132)¬†)\n\n117.\n\nConsequently, I consider that, given a clause designating a court of another Member State, which has been recognised to be compatible with Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation and is duly applicable to the dispute of which that court is seised, a court of a Member State ought to decline its own jurisdiction, even where that clause entails disregarding the special rules of jurisdiction laid down in Articles¬†5 and/or 6 of that regulation, and this notwithstanding the principle of the effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article¬†101 TFEU.\n\n3.¬†The effect, vis-√†-vis the other types of clause invoked, of the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Article¬†101 TFEU\n\n118.\n\nWith regard to the clauses conferring jurisdiction to which Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation proves not to be applicable and to arbitration clauses, the problem raised by the referring court is more complex, for it must be tackled by applying, not the provisions of that regulation, as interpreted by the Court, but rules of national law, whose implementation must be consistent with the binding provisions of EU primary law, and in particular with Article¬†101 TFEU.\n\n119.\n\nIn this connection, I would recall that, according to its consistent case-law in the judgments in¬†Courage and Crehan¬†and¬†Manfredi and Others,¬†(¬†[133](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0133)¬†) the Court has held that, failing EU legislation in that sphere, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to prescribe the detailed rules for exercising the right to compensation for damage resulting from an agreement, decision or concerted practice prohibited under Article¬†101 TFEU,¬†(¬†[134](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0134)¬†) subject to observance of the principles of equivalence and effectiveness which require, in particular, that those national rules should not hinder the full effectiveness of Union competition law and should take account, more specifically, of the objective contained in that article.¬†(¬†[135](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0135)¬†) In my opinion, it therefore follows in this case that the application of national rules may not allow the jurisdiction and/or arbitration clauses at issue to prejudice that full effectiveness.\n\n120.\n\nFurthermore, the Court has held that the full effect of Article¬†101 TFEU and, in particular, the effectiveness of paragraph¬†1 thereof¬†(¬†[136](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0136)¬†) would be put at risk if it were not open to any individual to claim damages for loss caused to him by a contract or conduct liable to restrict or distort competition, such as the unlawful cartel agreement which, in this case, forms the basis for CDC‚Äôs claims. The guarantee that individuals may seek such compensation is likely to discourage agreements or practices of this nature, which are often concealed, and it therefore contributes significantly towards maintaining effective competition within the Union.¬†(¬†[137](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0137)¬†)\n\n121.\n\nAs a general rule, when faced with an arbitration clause, a court of a Member State should decline jurisdiction and refer the parties to arbitration, at the request of one of the parties, unless that court finds that the arbitration agreement relied upon has lapsed, is inoperative or cannot be applied in the dispute before it, following scrutiny within the scope of its own jurisdiction, in the light of the requirements of domestic law,¬†(¬†[138](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0138)¬†) since the Brussels I Regulation does not regulate the conditions governing the validity of such a clause.¬†(¬†[139](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0139)¬†) The same would apply to clauses designating a national court which are not covered by Article¬†23 of the regulation.\n\n122.\n\nHowever, the principle requiring effective implementation of the prohibition under EU law of agreements, decisions and concerted practices, to which the Landgericht refers, can, in my view, be invoked vis-√†-vis the jurisdiction or arbitration clauses at issue for the purpose, in particular, of ensuring that all persons have the right to seek full compensation for losses resulting from a prohibited agreement, such as those alleged in the main proceedings.\n\n123.\n\nIn this connection, it is to be observed that the Court held in the judgment in¬†Eco Swiss, which concerns the relationship between arbitration and the competition rules under EU law, that Article¬†85 of the Treaty, now Article¬†101 TFEU, ‚Äòmay be regarded as a matter of public policy‚Äô.¬†(¬†[140](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0140)¬†) The Court held that ‚Äòwhere its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with [that article]. Community law requires that questions concerning the interpretation of the prohibition laid down in [that article] should be open to examination by national courts when asked to determine the validity of an arbitration award and that it should be possible for those questions to be referred, if necessary, to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling‚Äô.¬†(¬†[141](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0141)¬†)\n\n124.\n\nBy analogy, I consider that national courts are required by EU law not to apply an arbitration clause, or a jurisdiction clause not governed by Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation, in cases where the implementation of such a clause would hamper the effectiveness of Article¬†101 TFEU.¬†In this connection, it may with advantage be noted that the judgment in¬†Eco Swiss¬†predates those in¬†Courage and Crehan¬†and¬†Manfredi and Others, which upheld the recognition in EU law of a right to compensation for all damage suffered by persons adversely affected by unlawful barriers to free competition, not only in the interests of those persons but above all in order to preserve the general interests bound up with that freedom. The case-law after those two judgments has further reinforced that approach, by encouraging the private implementation of those competition rules (commonly known as ‚Äòprivate enforcement‚Äô), particularly following the removal of the potential obstacles deriving from national provisions.¬†(¬†[142](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0142)¬†)\n\n125.\n\nIt is true that the application of jurisdiction or arbitration clauses is not¬†in itself¬†an obstacle to the effectiveness of Article¬†101 TFEU within the meaning of the case-law cited. In particular, the fact that clauses of this type may, if they are valid and applicable to the dispute concerned, entail the ousting of the special bases of jurisdiction provided for in Articles¬†5 and/or 6 of the Brussels I Regulation does not necessarily have the effect of depriving the persons allegedly adversely affected by damage caused by an unlawful cartel agreement of the possibility of obtaining full compensation on that basis, given that they are not prevented from bringing actions before each of the appointed national or arbitration courts, even though, given the wide variety of clauses relied upon in this case, their application would certainly be likely to render such a course of action more difficult.\n\n126.\n\nNone the less, I consider that it is a matter of some delicacy to put that theoretical position into practice in the particular context of an unlawful cartel agreement, involving numerous participants and persons allegedly adversely affected, whose implementation has generated a multitude of individual supply contracts, possibly concluded between different companies in the group to which a vendor or purchaser belongs.¬†(¬†[143](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0143)¬†) In the case of a horizontal restriction of competition, such as that on which the main proceedings are based, I find it difficult to accept an exclusion of the normal forms of judicial protection, unless the parties allegedly adversely affected have expressly entered into an agreement to that effect and the national or arbitration courts to which jurisdiction has been assigned in this way are required to apply the provisions of EU competition law as rules of public policy.\n\n4.¬†The applicability of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in a dispute such as that in the main proceedings\n\n127.\n\nThe essential problem, which will arise by way of a preliminary consideration for the national court, is whether the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses relied upon by the defendants in the main proceedings are really apt to come into play in this case. Admittedly, in accordance with the Court‚Äôs case-law,¬†(¬†[144](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0144)¬†) it is only the court before which the main action was brought that may, and indeed must, assess the validity and scope of the jurisdiction clause relied upon against it. Although the order for reference is not explicit in this regard, the Landgericht Dortmund appears to take the view that the subject-matter of the dispute could be covered by the two types of clause included in the supply contracts which are binding on the defendants in the main proceedings.\n\n128.\n\nHowever, as CDC and the Commission both contend, there is considerable doubt as to whether the rights to claim damages invoked by the applicant in the main proceedings are derived from the contracts which contained those clauses.\n\n129.\n\nBy analogy with the Court‚Äôs ruling in relation to jurisdiction clauses covered by Article¬†23 of the Brussels I Regulation,¬†(¬†[145](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0145)¬†) I find it hard to accept that jurisdiction based on the provisions of that regulation could be excluded when the application of the law of a Member State allows another type of jurisdiction or arbitration clause to govern¬†all disputes¬†arising out of the relationship between a party and the other party to the contract and stemming from¬†relationships other than that in connection with which¬†the clause at issue was agreed. The requirement of a close connection between the clause invoked and a particular legal relationship also seems to be necessary here, in order to guarantee the predictability of jurisdiction.\n\n130.\n\nIn my opinion, the rights relied upon in this case derive, instead, from the tort consisting of the cartel agreement arranged and put in hand, covertly, by the defendants in the main proceedings. The issue in the case in the main proceedings is the pecuniary consequences of that fraudulent conduct, which is inherently different from the supply contracts invoked.¬†(¬†[146](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0146)¬†) It is not possible that a clause conferring jurisdiction or an arbitration clause should have been validly agreed in such circumstances, in other words, even before the persons allegedly adversely affected knew of the event giving rise to the damage or of the loss so occasioned.\n\n131.\n\nAfter all, the referring court too tends towards this interpretation of the nature of the case in the main proceedings, for it appears to take the view, particularly in relation to its second question, that the civil liability action pending before it comes under matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, covered by Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation, and not under matters relating to a contract, which are covered by Article¬†5(1) of the regulation.¬†(¬†[147](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0147)¬†) Nevertheless, in certain national legal systems, the classification of the subject-matter of a dispute as a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict does not in itself preclude the applicability of jurisdiction or arbitration clauses, which obviously depends, in each specific case, on the wording of the clause concerned.¬†(¬†[148](#t-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0148)¬†)\n\n132.\n\nIn consequence, I consider that Article¬†101 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action for compensation for damage caused by an agreement declared to be contrary to that article, the implementation of jurisdiction and/or arbitration clauses does not¬†in itself¬†compromise the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices. In so far as a clause of one or other of those categories could be declared applicable, pursuant to the law of a Member State, in a dispute concerning liability in matters of tort, delict or quasi-delict that might follow from such an agreement, that principle, in my view, precludes jurisdiction over that dispute being attributed under a clause of a contract whose content had been agreed when the party against whom that clause is relied on was unaware of the cartel agreement in question and of its unlawful nature, and could not, therefore, have foreseen that the clause could apply to the damages sought on that basis.\n\nV¬†‚Äì¬†Conclusion\n\n133.\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court of Justice should answer the questions referred to it for a preliminary ruling by the Landgericht Dortmund (Germany), as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n(a)\n\nArticle¬†6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No¬†44/2001 of 22¬†December 2000 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters is to be interpreted as meaning that, when proceedings are brought against a defendant domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court of one Member State and against defendants domiciled in other Member States of the European Union before that court for disclosure and damages on account of a single continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC (Article¬†101 TFEU), which has been established by the European Commission and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient for the cases to be prepared and tried together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\n\n(b)\n\nArticle¬†6(1) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the action against the sole co-defendant domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court seised is withdrawn does not affect the application of that provision, always provided, on the one hand, that the withdrawal occurred after the date on which that court had been validly seised and, on the other hand, that it is not connected with a binding transaction entered into between the applicant and that defendant before that date but which was concealed for the sole purpose of removing one of the other defendants from the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled.\n\n(2)\n\nArticle¬†5(3) of Regulation No¬†44/2001 is to be interpreted as meaning that, when defendants established in various Member States are sued for damages on account of a cartel agreement, declared by a decision of the European Commission to constitute a single continuous infringement of Article¬†81 EC (Article¬†101 TFEU), in which the defendants have participated in several Member States and in various places and at various times, the event giving rise to the damage is not to be regarded as having taken place, in relation to every defendant and in respect of all the heads of damage or the overall loss, in every one of the Member States in whose territory the unlawful cartel agreement was concluded and/or put into effect.\n\n(3)\n\nArticle¬†101 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action for compensation for damage caused by an infringement of that article, the principle of the full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices under EU law does not preclude the implementation of clauses conferring jurisdiction consistent with Article¬†23 of Regulation No¬†44/2001, whereas that principle does preclude the implementation of arbitration and/or jurisdiction clauses not covered by Article¬†23 when the national law applicable allows jurisdiction for that dispute to be attributed under a clause in a contract whose content had been agreed when the party against whom that clause is relied upon was unaware of the cartel agreement in question and of its unlawful nature.\n\n---\n\n(¬†[1](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0001)¬†) Original language: French.\n\n(¬†[2](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0002)¬†)¬†[OJ 2001 L¬†12, p.¬†1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2001:012:TOC).

In that connection, it will suffice to point out that the questions raised by the referring court in the factual and regulatory context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court, enjoy a presumption of relevance which can be overturned only in a limited number of circumstances (see, inter alia, the judgment in¬†Pohotovost‚Äô, C‚Äë470/12,¬†[EU:C:2014:101](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A101\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†27 et seq.), circumstances which, in my view, do not prevail in this case.\n\n(¬†[38](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0038)¬†) In particular, according to FMC Foret, the courts of a Member State should have jurisdiction only to rule on claims based on the part of the unlawful cartel agreement which was entered into or which produced its effects in that State, whereas Solvay submits that a close link between the court seised and the dispute should be established, by way of a connecting factor for establishing jurisdiction, separately with respect to every defendant and for the overall damage alleged.\n\n(¬†[39](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0039)¬†) See, inter alia, the judgments in¬†R√©union europ√©enne and

and¬†20).\n\n(¬†[42](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0042)¬†) In matters relating to tort and delict, the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred are usually the most appropriate for deciding the case, in particular on grounds of proximity and ease of taking evidence (see, inter alia, the judgment in¬†Melzer,¬†[EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null),

and¬†48).\n\n(¬†[45](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0045)¬†) The referring court indicates that this problem arises ‚Äò[e]ven assuming that liability is attributed to all the defendants, on the ground that the infringement at issue is a single and continuous infringement committed by a number of co-perpetrators contrary to Article¬†81 EC/Article¬†101 TFEU‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[46](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0046)¬†) See the judgment in¬†LAL-Lithuanian

paragraph¬†28).\n\n(¬†[47](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0047)¬†) On the other hand, Article¬†5(3) could, in my view, apply to vertical restrictions of competition¬†‚Äî provided that the liability invoked is not of a contractual nature¬†‚Äî and to cartel agreements whose scope is geographically limited, seeing that the geographical location of both the anti-competitive act and its effect can be clearly identified.\n\n(¬†[48](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0048)¬†) See recital 15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n(¬†[49](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0049)¬†) Regarding the various aspects of the practical implementation of the cartel in this case, see point¬†18 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[50](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0050)¬†)¬†[EU:C:2013:305](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A305\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†40.\n\n(¬†[51](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0051)¬†) Negative action as a result of a cartel agreement is not equivalent to positive action, because abstention cannot as such be linked to a specific place (see, by analogy, the judgment in¬†Besix, C‚Äë256/00,¬†[EU:C:2002:99](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A99\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†49, where the disputed contractual obligation was an undertaking not to act which was not subject to any geographical limit).\n\n(¬†[52](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0052)¬†) See Advocate General Cruz Villal√≥n in his Opinion in¬†Hejduk¬†(C‚Äë441/13,¬†[EU:C:2014:2212](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2212\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), point¬†42), who pointed out that ‚Äò[a] criterion which requires a plaintiff to circumscribe the scope of his action according to territorial criteria which are difficult, if not impossible, to determine, is not a criterion which reflects the spirit of the [Brussels I] Regulation‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[53](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0053)¬†) In my view there should be a distinction between this situation and those, for example, of a classic cartel managed by a trade association or a cartel whose activity is geographically concentrated because of a single venue for meetings, given that in such situations there would not be an equivalent dispersal of damage-causing events.\n\n(¬†[54](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0054)¬†) Thus, in the judgment in¬†Kone and Others¬†(C‚Äë557/12,¬†[EU:C:2014:1317](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1317\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†30 et seq.), the Court held that ‚Äòa loss being suffered by the customer of an undertaking not party to a cartel, but benefiting from the economic conditions of umbrella pricing, because of an offer price higher than it would have been but for the existence of that cartel is one of the possible effects of the cartel, that the members thereof cannot disregard‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[55](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0055)¬†) In the judgment in¬†Dumez France and Tracoba¬†(C‚Äë220/88,¬†[EU:C:1990:8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1990%3A8\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†20), the Court interpreted Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels Convention as meaning that the person indirectly adversely affected may bring an action, on that basis, only before the court of the place where the event giving rise to the damage directly produced its harmful effects on the person who is immediately adversely affected.\n\n(¬†[56](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0056)¬†) It follows from the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation that the latter limits the cases in which a defendant may be sued before the court of the applicant‚Äôs domicile (see, in relation to the Brussels Convention, the judgments in¬†Six Constructions, 32/88,¬†[EU:C:1989:68](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A68\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs¬†13

paragraph¬†19).\n\n(¬†[57](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0057)¬†) In this connection, recital 21 in the preamble to the Rome II Regulation indicates that ‚Äò[t]he connection to the law of the country where competitive relations ‚Ä¶ are, or are likely to be affected, [which is laid down, in respect of acts restricting free competition, in Article¬†6 of that regulation] generally ‚Ä¶ protect[s] competitors, consumers and the general public and ensure[s] the proper functioning of the market economy‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[58](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0058)¬†) Ashton, D., and Henry, D.,¬†Competition Damages Action in the EU, Law and Practice, Elgar Competition Law and Practice Series, Cheltenham, 2013, p.¬†179, point¬†7.030, emphasise that ‚Äò[i]n the case of a pan-European cartel [the place

paragraph¬†33, which indicates that ‚Äòthe courts of each Contracting State [to the Brussels Convention] in which the publication was distributed and where the victim claims to have suffered injury to

Under the terms of that judgment, ‚Äòthe special jurisdictional rule in matters relating to a contract laid down in Article¬†5(1) of the Brussels Convention is not applicable where ‚Ä¶ the place of performance of the obligation in question¬†cannot be determined because it¬†consists in an undertaking not to do something which is not subject to any geographical limit and¬†is¬†therefore¬†characterised by a multiplicity of places¬†for its performance‚Äô (my italics).\n\n(¬†[65](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0065)¬†) A finding of a connecting factor can of course also be made in the context of Article¬†28 of the Brussels I Regulation, but in a different manner (see footnote 70 of this Opinion).\n\n(¬†[66](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0066)¬†) See point¬†44 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[67](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0067)¬†) See, starting from the Court‚Äôs first judgment interpreting Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels Convention, the judgment in¬†Kalfelis¬†(189/87,¬†[EU:C:1988:459](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1988%3A459\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†10), then later in relation to Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, inter alia, the judgment in¬†Reisch Montage¬†(C‚Äë103/05,¬†[EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs¬†27 to¬†30).\n\n(¬†[68](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0068)¬†) Recital 11 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation states that ‚Äò[t]he domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction‚Äô and Article¬†60(1) provides that, for the purpose of applying the regulation, a company or other legal person is domiciled at the place where it has its statutory seat, central administration, or principal place of business.\n\n(¬†[69](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0069)¬†) As pointed out in the judgment in¬†Freeport¬†([EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†53), that condition did not figure in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels Convention, but was inferred by the Court in the judgment in¬†Kalfelis¬†([EU:C:1988:459](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1988%3A459\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†12) concerning the interpretation of that provision and was later adopted by the Union legislature, which introduced it into the wording of the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n(¬†[70](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0070)¬†) The condition set out in Article¬†6(1) of the regulation is formulated in the same manner in Article¬†28, which defines the concept of connexity in the case of several courts potentially having jurisdiction, whereas Article¬†6(1), by contrast, provides for an extension of the jurisdiction of the court seised to cover defendants who would not normally fall under its jurisdiction. In the judgment in¬†Tatry¬†(C‚Äë406/92,¬†[EU:C:1994:400](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A400\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†53), relating to Article¬†22 of the Brussels Convention, which equates to Article¬†28 of the Brussels I Regulation, the Court held that it is sufficient that there is ‚Äòa risk of conflicting decisions, even if the judgments can be separately enforced and their legal consequences are not mutually exclusive‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[71](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0071)¬†) See the judgment in¬†Painer¬†(C‚Äë145/10,¬†[EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†77) relating to recitals 12 and¬†15 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation.\n\n(¬†[72](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0072)¬†) See, inter alia, the judgments in¬†Glaxosmithkline and Laboratoires Glaxosmithkline¬†(C‚Äë462/06,¬†[EU:C:2008:299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A299\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†28) and¬†Painer¬†([EU:C:2011:798](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A798\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†74).\n\n(¬†[73](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0073)¬†) The judgment in¬†Glaxosmithkline and Laboratoires Glaxosmithkline¬†([EU:C:2008:299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A299\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†20 et seq.) excludes recourse to that provision where the rules on jurisdiction designed to protect a weak party, contained in Section¬†5 of Chapter II of the Brussels I Regulation, are applicable.\n\n(¬†[74](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0074)¬†) Kemira submits that the first part of the first question is inadmissible on the grounds that the referring court may in no circumstances claim jurisdiction on the basis of Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation, because only the Landgericht Essen (Regional Court Essen, Germany) has jurisdiction¬†ratione loci, not the Landgericht, Dortmund, for the seat of the ‚Äòanchor defendant‚Äô is in Essen. It is true that that provision refers to the¬†court¬†for the place where any one of the defendants in the main proceedings¬†is domiciled, and not to all¬†the courts¬†of a Member State, as does Article¬†2 of the regulation. Nevertheless, it is acceptable, in my view, for a domestic rule to operate a centralisation of jurisdiction¬†ratione materiae, particularly in the competition field, as in the case of Article¬†89 of the Act on Restrictions of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr√§nkungen, GWB) in Germany, provided that such a rule does not discriminate between cross-border disputes and domestic disputes and exclude the former from the jurisdiction of a court which would normally have jurisdiction both¬†ratione loci¬†and¬†ratione materiae.

As part of its task of interpretation, the Court has already effected a parallel between competition rules laid down in the Brussels I Regulation and more recent rules on conflict of laws also flowing from Union law (see, inter alia, the judgments in¬†Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof, C‚Äë585/08 and¬†C‚Äë144/09,¬†[EU:C:2010:740](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A740\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs¬†43, 74 and¬†84, and¬†Football Dataco and Others, C‚Äë173/11,¬†[EU:C:2012:642](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A642\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs¬†29 and¬†31).\n\n(¬†[87](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0087)¬†) See footnote 6 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[88](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0088)¬†) Also known as the principle of¬†forum perpetuum, or the principle of¬†perpetuatio fori, to use the terminology employed in the order for reference.\n\n(¬†[89](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0089)¬†) Evonik Degussa, for its part, limited its observations to an objection of inadmissibility directed at this part of the first question, on the grounds that it was hypothetical and irrelevant. In my view, the case-law cited in footnote 37 of this Opinion is sufficient justification for rejecting this objection of inadmissibility.\n\n(¬†[90](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0090)¬†)¬†[EU:C:2006:471](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2006%3A471\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraphs¬†27 to¬†31 (my italics). In that case, the national rule which led to inadmissibility vis-√†-vis the anchor defendant precluded individual actions by creditors against a bankrupt debtor.\n\n(¬†[91](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0091)¬†)¬†[EU:C:2007:595](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2007%3A595\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†54.\n\n(¬†[92](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0092)¬†) In this case, the order for reference states that notice of the action was served on the German company Evonik Degussa on 7¬†April 2009 and that the other defendants in the main proceedings received translated applications in August 2009, whereas the action against Evonik Degussa was withdrawn at the end of September 2009.\n\n(¬†[93](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0093)¬†) Article¬†30 provides that ‚Äò[for] the purposes of this Section, a court is deemed to be seised: 1) at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the plaintiff has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have service effected on the defendant, or, 2) if the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service, provided that the plaintiff has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[94](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0094)¬†) In the judgment in¬†Kalfelis¬†([EU:C:1988:459](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1988%3A459\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†11), the Court also established a formal connection between the jurisdiction rule in Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels Convention (corresponding to Article¬†6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation) and the provisions relating to connexity in Article¬†22 thereof (corresponding to Article¬†28 of the regulation).\n\n(¬†[95](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0095)¬†) See recitals 11 and¬†12 in the preamble to the Brussels I Regulation and recitals 15 and¬†16 in the preamble to Regulation No¬†1215/2012, which recasts the former, the latter being more detailed in this regard.\n\n(¬†[96](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0096)¬†) My italics.

Arbitration shall take place in Helsinki, Finland‚Äù‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[108](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0108)¬†) This being the case with Stora Enso Oyj in the examples given in the two preceding footnotes.\n\n(¬†[109](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0109)¬†) CDC indicates that ‚ÄòKemira Kemi AB and the assignor S√∂dra Cell AB agreed on 27¬†June 1996, in respect of the supply period 1¬†January 1996 to 31¬†December 1998, that arbitration would take place in Stockholm [Sweden], and on 2 and¬†30¬†April, in respect of an unspecified delivery period, that arbitration would take place in Malm√∂ [Sweden]‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[110](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0110)¬†) In this connection, see point¬†127 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[111](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0111)¬†) Article¬†1(2)(d) of the Brussels I Regulation excludes arbitration from its scope. Given that the Brussels Convention contained an equivalent clause, paragraph¬†63 of the Schlosser report, cited above, indicated that ‚Äò[t]he 1968 Convention as such in no way restricts the freedom of the parties to submit disputes to arbitration. This applies even to proceedings for which the 1968 Convention has established exclusive jurisdiction. Nor, of course, does the Convention preclude national legislation from invalidating arbitration agreements affecting disputes for which exclusive jurisdiction exists under national law or pursuant to the 1968 Convention‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[112](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0112)¬†) The Court has held that, by excluding arbitration from the scope of the Brussels Convention, on the ground that it was already covered by international conventions, the Contracting Parties intended to exclude arbitration in its entirety, including proceedings brought before national courts, and that that exclusion extends to such a procedure, whose purpose is to appoint an arbitration tribunal, even if that dispute raises the initial question of the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement (See the judgment in¬†Rich, C‚Äë190/89,¬†[EU:C:1991:319](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1991%3A319\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=null), paragraph¬†18, and the

Free Trade Association (EFTA), which mirrors the Brussels Convention and was revised by a convention concluded in Lugano on 30¬†October 2007 between the European Community, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway and the Swiss Confederation [see the Explanatory Report of Mr¬†Pocar concerning that convention ([OJ 2009 C¬†319,

least all those which sit in EU territory, are required, under primary law, to guarantee effective exercise of the rights deriving from Article¬†101 TFEU.¬†Thus, only clauses which confer jurisdiction on a court outside that territory could be problematic from the point of view of the principle of full effectiveness of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in Union law.\n\n(¬†[117](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0117)¬†) See point¬†37 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[118](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0118)¬†) See point¬†127 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[119](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0119)¬†) However, Article¬†6(4) of the Rome II Regulation provides that ‚Äò[t]he law applicable under this Article [entitled ‚ÄúUnfair competition and acts restricting free competition‚Äù][to non-contractual obligations] may not be derogated from by an agreement pursuant to Article¬†14‚Äô, namely ‚Äòan agreement entered into after the event giving rise to the damage occurred‚Äô or ‚Äòwhere all the parties are pursuing a commercial activity, also by an agreement freely negotiated before the event giving rise to the damage occurred‚Äô which also complies with the other conditions set forth in that article.\n\n(¬†[120](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0120)¬†) I would point out that an expression of the wishes of the parties in the form of a jurisdiction clause cannot, on the contrary, alter the jurisdiction¬†ratione materiae¬†of a court of a Member State, which is determined by the law of the court seised.\n\n(¬†[121](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0121)¬†) See the judgment in¬†Estasis Saloti di

and¬†21 of that regulation).\n\n(¬†[124](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0124)¬†) Regarding the classification of the subject-matter of the dispute in the main proceedings and the resultant consequences in

(2003) EWHC 961] and, on the other hand, that the Helsingen k√§r√§j√§oikeus (court of first instance, Helsinki, Finland) ruled, similarly, that an arbitration clause referring to ‚Äòall the rights‚Äô arising from a supply contract did not cover rights to claim damages as a result of a cartel agreement, in that the latter did not flow directly from that agreement but from a situation which was external to the latter, namely the participation of the defendant in a collusive agreement (interlocutory judgment of 4¬†July 2013,¬†CDC Hydrogen Peroxide Cartel Damage Claims SA¬†v¬†Kemira Oyj, V√§lituomio 36492 no¬†11/16750).\n\n(¬†[147](#c-ECR_62013CC0352_EN_01-E0147)¬†) ‚ÄòIt is apparent from settled case-law that the concept of ‚Äúmatters relating to tort, delict, or quasi-delict‚Äù within the meaning of Article¬†5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation covers all actions which seek to establish the liability of a defendant and which do not concern ‚Äúmatters relating to a contract‚Äù within the meaning of Article¬†5(1) of the regulation.

An arbitration award, whether complete or partial, shall not acquire the force of res judicata unless it is a final award. It shall acquire that force from the date on which it is made.\n\n2. However, where, in accordance with the agreement between the parties, an appeal may be made to a higher arbitration tribunal against a complete or partial final award, that award shall acquire the force of res judicata as from the date on which the time-limit for appealing expires or, if an appeal is lodged, from the date on which the decision is given in the appeal proceedings, if and in so far as that decision upholds the award appealed against.'\n\n6 As regards judicial review of arbitration awards, Article 1064 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n`1. An action contesting (a) a final arbitration award, whether complete or partial, against which no appeal may be made to a higher arbitration tribunal or (b) a final arbitration award, whether complete or partial, made on appeal to a higher arbitration tribunal may be brought only by way of an application for annulment or a request-civiel in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n2. An application for annulment shall be made to the Rechtbank, at the registry of which the original of the award must be lodged pursuant to Article 1058(1).\n\n3. A party may lodge an application for annulment as soon as the award has acquired the force of res judicata. The right to bring an action shall expire three months after the date of lodgement of the award at the registry of the Rechtbank. However, where the award, endorsed with an order for its enforcement, is served on the other party to the proceedings, that party may, notwithstanding the expiry of the period of three months referred to in the previous sentence, lodge an application for annulment within three months from the date of such service.\n\n4. An application may be lodged for annulment of an interim arbitration award only together with the application for annulment of the complete or partial final arbitration award.\n\n...'.\n\n7 Article 1065 of the Code provides:\n\n`1. Annulment may be ordered only on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) there is no valid arbitration agreement;\n\n(b) the arbitration tribunal has been constituted in breach of the applicable rules;\n\n(c) the arbitration tribunal has failed to comply with its terms of reference;\n\n(d) the award has not been signed or does not state the reasons on which it is based, contrary to the provisions of Article 1057;\n\n(e) the award or the manner in which it has been made is contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.\n\n...\n\n4. An award may not be annulled on the ground referred to in paragraph 1(c) above if the party pleading that ground took part in the proceedings without raising it in those proceedings despite having been aware that the arbitration tribunal was failing to comply with its terms of reference.'\n\n8 Finally, Article 1066(1) and (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an application for annulment does not operate to stay enforcement of the award, but the court seised of such an application may, if a stay is justified and at the request of either party, order a stay of enforcement pending a definitive decision on the application for annulment. An application for a stay must be based on the existence of a reasonable prospect that the arbitration award will be annulled.\n\nThe main proceedings\n\n9 On 1 July 1986 Benetton, a company established in Amsterdam, concluded a licensing agreement for a period of eight years with Eco Swiss, established in Kowloon (Hong Kong), and Bulova Watch Company Inc. (`Bulova'), established in Wood Side (New York). Under that agreement, Benetton granted Eco Swiss the right to manufacture watches and clocks bearing the words `Benetton by Bulova', which could then be sold by Eco Swiss and Bulova.\n\n10 Article 26.A of the licensing agreement provides that all disputes or differences arising between the parties are to be settled by arbitration in conformity with the rules of the Nederlands Arbitrage Instituut (Netherlands Institute of Arbitrators) and that the arbitrators appointed are to apply Netherlands law.\n\n11 By letter of 24 June 1991, Benetton gave notice of termination of the agreement with effect from 24 September 1991, three years before the end of the period originally provided for. Arbitration proceedings were instituted between Benetton, Eco Swiss and Bulova in relation to the termination of the agreement.\n\n12 In their award of 4 February 1993, entitled `Partial Final Award' (hereinafter `the PFA'), lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank (District Court) te 's-Gravenhage on the same date, the arbitrators directed inter alia that Benetton should compensate Eco Swiss and Bulova for the damage which they had suffered as a result of Benetton's termination of the licensing agreement.\n\n13 When the parties failed to come to agreement on the quantum of damages to be paid by Benetton to Eco Swiss and Bulova, the arbitrators on 23 June 1995 made an award entitled `Final Arbitral Award' (hereinafter `the FAA'), which was lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank on 26 June 1995, ordering Benetton to pay USD 23 750 000 to Eco Swiss and USD 2 800 000 to Bulova by way of compensation for the damage suffered by them. By order of the President of the Rechtbank of 17 July 1995, leave was given to enforce the FAA.\n\n14 On 14 July 1995, Benetton applied to the Rechtbank for annulment of the PFA and the FAA on the ground, inter alia, that those arbitration awards were contrary to public policy by virtue of the nullity of the licensing agreement under Article 85 of the Treaty, although during the arbitration proceedings neither the parties nor the arbitrators had raised the point that the licensing agreement might be contrary to that provision.\n\n15 The Rechtbank dismissed that application by decision of 2 October 1996, whereupon Benetton appealed to the Gerechtshof (Regional Court of Appeal) te 's-Gravenhage, before which the case is pending.\n\n16 By application lodged at the registry of the Rechtbank on 24 July 1995 Benetton also requested that court to stay enforcement of the FAA and, in the alternative, to order Eco Swiss to provide security.\n\n17 By order of 19 September 1995 the Rechtbank allowed only the alternative claim.\n\n18 Benetton lodged an appeal against that decision. By order of 28 March 1996 the Gerechtshof essentially allowed the primary claim.\n\n19 The Gerechtshof took the view that Article 85 of the Treaty is a provision of public policy within the meaning of Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure, infringement of which may result in annulment of an arbitration award.\n\n20 However, the Gerechtshof considered that, in the proceedings before it for stay of enforcement, it was unable to examine whether a partial final award such as the PFA was in conformity with Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure, since Benetton had not lodged an application for annulment within three months after the lodging of that award at the registry of the Rechtbank, as required by Article 1064(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n21 Nevertheless, the Gerechtshof took the view that it was able to examine the FAA in relation to Article 1065(1)(e), particularly as regards the effect of Article 85(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the assessment of damage, since to award compensation for damage flowing from the wrongful termination of the licensing agreement would amount to enforcing that agreement, whereas it was, at least in part, void under Article 85(1) and (2) of the Treaty. The agreement in question enabled the parties to operate a market-sharing arrangement, since Eco Swiss could no longer sell watches and clocks in Italy and Bulova could no longer do so in the other countries which were then Member States of the Community. As Benetton and Eco Swiss acknowledge, the licensing agreement was not notified to the Commission and is not covered by a block exemption.\n\n22 The Gerechtshof considered that, in the procedure for annulment, the FAA could be held to be contrary to public policy, and therefore decided to grant the application for a stay in so far as it related to the FAA.\n\n23 Eco Swiss brought proceedings in cassation before the Hoge Raad against the decision of the Gerechtshof and Benetton lodged a cross-appeal.\n\n24 The Hoge Raad observes that an arbitration award is contrary to public policy within the meaning of Article 1065(1)(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure only if its terms or enforcement conflict with a mandatory rule so fundamental that no restrictions of a procedural nature should prevent its application. It states that, in Netherlands law, the mere fact that, because of the terms or enforcement of an arbitration award, a prohibition laid down in competition law is not applied is not generally regarded as being contrary to public policy.\n\n25 However, referring to the judgment in Joined Cases C-430/93 and C-431/93 Van Schijndel and Van Veen v SPF [1995] ECR I-4705, the Hoge Raad wonders whether the position is the same where, as in the case now before it, the provision in question is a rule of Community law. The Hoge Raad infers from that judgment that Article 85 of the Treaty is not to be regarded as a mandatory rule which is so fundamental that no restrictions of a procedural nature should prevent it from being observed.\n\n26 Moreover, since it is not disputed that the question whether the licensing agreement might be void under Article 85 of the Treaty was not raised in the course of the arbitration proceedings, the Hoge Raad considers that the arbitrators would have gone beyond the ambit of the dispute if they had inquired into and ruled on that question. In such a case, their award would have been open to annulment pursuant to Article 1065(1)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, because they would have failed to comply with their terms of reference. Furthermore, according to the Hoge Raad, the parties themselves could not have raised the question of the possible nullity of the licensing agreement for the first time in the context of the proceedings for annulment.\n\n27 The Hoge Raad states that such rules of procedure are justified by the general interest in having an effectively functioning arbitration procedure and that they are no less favourable to application of rules of Community law than to application of rules of national law.\n\n28 However, the Hoge Raad is uncertain whether the principles laid down by the Court in Van Schijndel and Van Veen, cited above, also apply to arbitrators, particularly since, according to the judgment in Case 102/81 Nordsee v Reederei Mond [1982] ECR 1095, an arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to an agreement under private law, without State intervention, is not to be regarded as a court or tribunal for the purposes of Article 177 of the Treaty and cannot therefore make references for a preliminary ruling under that article.\n\n29 The Hoge Raad explains that, under Netherlands procedural law, where arbitrators have settled part of a dispute by an interim award which is in the nature of a final award, that award has the force of res judicata and, if annulment of that interim award has not been sought in proper time, the possibility of applying for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award proceeding upon the interim award is restricted by the principle of res judicata. However, the Hoge Raad is uncertain whether Community law precludes the Gerechtshof from applying such a procedural rule where, as in the present case, the subsequent arbitration award, the annulment of which has been applied for in proper time, proceeds upon an earlier arbitration award.\n\n30 In those circumstances, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n`(1) To what extent is the ruling of the Court of Justice in Joined Cases C-430/93 and C-431/93 Van Schijndel and Van Veen v SPF [1995] ECR I-4705 applicable by analogy if, in a dispute concerning a private law agreement brought before arbitrators and not before the national courts, the parties make no reference to Article 85 of the EC Treaty and, according to the rules of national procedural law applicable to them, the arbitrators are not at liberty to apply those provisions of their own motion?\n\n(2) If the court considers that an arbitration award is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the EC Treaty, must it, on that ground and notwithstanding the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.4 above according to which a party may claim annulment of an arbitration award only on a limited number of grounds, one ground being that an award is contrary to public policy, which generally does not cover the mere fact that through the terms or enforcement of an arbitration award no effect is given to a prohibition laid down by competition law], allow a claim for annulment of that award if the claim otherwise complies with statutory requirements?\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraph 4.5 above according to which arbitrators must not go outside the ambit of disputes and must keep to their terms of reference], is the court also required to allow such a claim if the question of the applicability of Article 85 of the EC Treaty remained outside the ambit of the dispute in the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrators therefore made no determination in that regard?\n\n(4) Does Community law require the rules of Netherlands procedural law set out in paragraph 5.3 above according to which an interim arbitration award that is in the nature of a final award acquires the force of res judicata and is open to appeal only within a period of three months following lodgement of the award at the registry of the Rechtbank] to be disapplied if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which an interim arbitration award having the force of res judicata has held to be valid may nevertheless be void because it conflicts with Article 85 of the EC Treaty?\n\n(5) Or, in a case such as that described in Question 4, is it necessary to refrain from applying the rule that, in so far as an interim arbitration award is in the nature of a final award, annulment of that award may not be sought simultaneously with that of the subsequent arbitration award?'\n\nThe second question\n\n31 By its second question, which is best examined first, the referring court is asking essentially whether a national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant such an application where, in its view, that award is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty although, under domestic procedural rules, it may grant such an application only on a limited number of grounds, one of them being inconsistency with public policy, which, according to the applicable national law, is not generally to be invoked on the sole ground that, because of the terms or the enforcement of an arbitration award, effect will not be given to a prohibition laid down by domestic competition law.\n\n32 It is to be noted, first of all, that, where questions of Community law are raised in an arbitration resorted to by agreement, the ordinary courts may have to examine those questions, in particular during review of the arbitration award, which may be more or less extensive depending on the circumstances and which they are obliged to carry out in the event of an appeal, for setting aside, for leave to enforce an award or upon any other form of action or review available under the relevant national legislation (Nordsee, cited above, paragraph 14).\n\n33 In paragraph 15 of the judgment in Nordsee, the Court went on to explain that it is for those national courts and tribunals to ascertain whether it is necessary for them to make a reference to the Court under Article 177 of the Treaty in order to obtain an interpretation or assessment of the validity of provisions of Community law which they may need to apply when reviewing an arbitration award.\n\n34 In this regard, the Court had held, in paragraphs 10 to 12 of that judgment, that an arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to an agreement between the parties is not a 'court or tribunal of a Member State' within the meaning of Article 177 of the Treaty since the parties are under no obligation, in law or in fact, to refer their disputes to arbitration and the public authorities of the Member State concerned are not involved in the decision to opt for arbitration nor required to intervene of their own accord in the proceedings before the arbitrator.\n\n35 Next, it is in the interest of efficient arbitration proceedings that review of arbitration awards should be limited in scope and that annulment of or refusal to recognise an award should be possible only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n36 However, according to Article 3(g) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 3(1)(g) EC), Article 85 of the Treaty constitutes a fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market. The importance of such a provision led the framers of the Treaty to provide expressly, in Article 85(2) of the Treaty, that any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article are to be automatically void.\n\n37 It follows that where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with the prohibition laid down in Article 85(1) of the Treaty.\n\n38 That conclusion is not affected by the fact that the New York Convention of 10 June 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which has been ratified by all the Member States, provides that recognition and enforcement of an arbitration award may be refused only on certain specific grounds, namely where the award does not fall within the terms of the submission to arbitration or goes beyond its scope, where the award is not binding on the parties or where recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the country where such recognition and enforcement are sought (Article V(1)(c) and (e) and II(b) of the New York Convention).\n\n39 For the reasons stated in paragraph 36 above, the provisions of Article 85 of the Treaty may be regarded as a matter of public policy within the meaning of the New York Convention.\n\n40 Lastly, it should be recalled that, as explained in paragraph 34 above, arbitrators, unlike national courts and tribunals, are not in a position to request this Court to give a preliminary ruling on questions of interpretation of Community law. However, it is manifestly in the interest of the Community legal order that, in order to forestall differences of interpretation, every Community provision should be given a uniform interpretation, irrespective of the circumstances in which it is to be applied (Case C-88/91 Federconsorzi [1992] ECR I-4035, paragraph 7). It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, unlike Van Schijndel and Van Veen, Community law requires that questions concerning the interpretation of the prohibition laid down in Article 85(1) of the Treaty should be open to examination by national courts when asked to determine the validity of an arbitration award and that it should be possible for those questions to be referred, if necessary, to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.\n\n41 The answer to be given to the second question must therefore be that a national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant that application if it considers that the award in question is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the Treaty, where its domestic rules of procedure require it to grant an application for annulment founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy.\n\nThe first and third questions\n\n42 In view of the reply given to the second question, there is no need to answer the first and third questions.\n\nThe fourth and fifth questions\n\n43 By its fourth and fifth questions, which can be examined together, the referring court is asking essentially whether Community law requires a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of the subsequent award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n44 According to the relevant domestic rules of procedure, application for annulment of an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award may be made within a period of three months following the lodging of that award at the registry of the court having jurisdiction in the matter.\n\n45 Such a period, which does not seem excessively short compared with those prescribed in the legal systems of the other Member States, does not render excessively difficult or virtually impossible the exercise of rights conferred by Community law.\n\n46 Moreover, domestic procedural rules which, upon the expiry of that period, restrict the possibility of applying for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award proceeding upon an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award, because it has become res judicata, are justified by the basic principles of the national judicial system, such as the principle of legal certainty and acceptance of res judicata, which is an expression of that principle.\n\n47 In those circumstances, Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying such rules, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n48 The answer to be given to the fourth and fifth questions must therefore be that Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n_\n\n## Decision on costs\n\n  \n_\n\nCosts\n\n49 The costs incurred by the Netherlands, French, Italian and United Kingdom Governments and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.\n\n_\n\n## Operative part\n\n  \n_\n\nOn those grounds,\n\nTHE COURT,\n\nin answer to the questions referred to it by the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden by order of 21 March 1997, hereby rules:\n\n1. A national court to which application is made for annulment of an arbitration award must grant that application if it considers that the award in question is in fact contrary to Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now Article 81 EC), where its domestic rules of procedure require it to grant an application for annulment founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy.\n\n2. Community law does not require a national court to refrain from applying domestic rules of procedure according to which an interim arbitration award which is in the nature of a final award and in respect of which no application for annulment has been made within the prescribed time-limit acquires the force of res judicata and may no longer be called in question by a subsequent arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine, in proceedings for annulment of a subsequent arbitration award, whether an agreement which the interim award held to be valid in law is nevertheless void under Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\n_","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.115670017Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Genentech-AG":{"title":"","content":"OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL\n\nWATHELET\n\ndelivered on 17¬†March 2016¬†(¬†[1](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0001)¬†)\n\nCase C‚Äë567/14\n\nGenentech Inc.\n\nv\n\nHoechst GmbH, formerly Hoechst AG,\n\nSanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH(Request for a preliminary ruling from the\n\ncour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) (France))\n\n‚ÄõReference for a preliminary ruling ‚Äî Action for annulment of an arbitral award ‚Äî Competition ‚Äî Article¬†101 TFEU ‚Äî Agreements, decisions and concerted practices ‚Äî Non-exclusive patent licence agreement ‚Äî Revocation of patents ‚Äî No infringement ‚Äî Effect ‚Äî Obligation to pay royalties‚Äô\n\nI¬†‚Äì¬†Introduction\n\n1.\n\nThis request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article¬†101 TFEU.¬†More specifically, the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) asks whether this article precludes an obligation imposed on a licensee under a patent licence agreement to pay royalties for the entire duration of the agreement until its termination, notwithstanding the absence of infringement or the revocation of the licensed patent or patents.\n\n2.\n\nThe request was submitted in the context of an action for annulment of arbitral awards filed by Genentech Inc., a company incorporated under Delaware law (United States of America) (‚ÄòGenentech‚Äô) against Hoechst GmbH, formerly Hoechst AG (‚ÄòHoechst‚Äô) and Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (‚ÄòSanofi-Aventis‚Äô), companies incorporated under German law.\n\nII¬†‚Äì¬†Legal framework\n\nA¬†‚Äì¬†EU law\n\n3.\n\nArticle¬†101 TFEU provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:\n\n(a)\n\ndirectly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;\n\n(b)\n\nlimit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;\n\n(c)\n\nshare markets or sources of supply;\n\n(d)\n\napply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;\n\n(e)\n\nmake the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall be automatically void.\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†The provisions of paragraph¬†1¬†may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of:\n\n‚Äî\n\nany agreement or category of agreements between undertakings,\n\n‚Äî\n\nany decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings,\n\n‚Äî\n\nany concerted practice or category of concerted practices,\n\nwhich contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not:\n\n(a)\n\nimpose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives;\n\n(b)\n\nafford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.‚Äô\n\nB¬†‚Äì¬†French law\n\n4.\n\nArticle¬†1518 of the Code of Civil Procedure (code de proc√©dure civile) provides:\n\n‚ÄòAn international arbitral award delivered in France may be challenged only by way of an action for annulment.‚Äô\n\n5.\n\nArticle¬†1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n‚ÄòAn action for annulment is available only in the following cases:\n\n1.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal wrongly declared itself to have or not to have jurisdiction;\n\n2.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal was improperly constituted;\n\n3.\n\nWhere the arbitral tribunal issued a ruling without fulfilling the mandate entrusted to it;\n\n4.\n\nWhere the adversarial principle was not observed;

This technology was the subject of European Patent No EP 0173¬†177¬†53, issued on 22¬†April 1992 (‚Äòpatent EP 177‚Äô), as well as two patents issued in the United States on 15¬†December 1998 and 17¬†April 2001 (‚Äòpatent US 522‚Äô and ‚Äòpatent US 140‚Äô, respectively). On 12¬†January 1999, the European Patent Office (EPO) revoked patent EP 177.\n\n7.\n\nThe licence agreement was governed by German law.\n\n8.\n\nUnder Article¬†3.1 of the licence agreement, Genentech undertook to pay, as consideration for the right to use the enhancer:\n\n‚Äî\n\na one-off fee of DEM 20000 (around EUR¬†10225) for the costs of issuing the licence;\n\n‚Äî\n\na fixed annual research fee of DEM 20000 (around EUR¬†10225); and\n\n‚Äî\n\na ‚Äòrunning‚Äô royalty of 0.5% levied on the amount of sales of ‚Äòfinished products‚Äô¬†(¬†[3](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0003)¬†) (‚Äòthe running royalty‚Äô).\n\n9.\n\nGenentech paid the one-off fee and the annual fee, but never paid the running royalty.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30¬†June 2008, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis made enquiries with Genentech about the finished products using the patented materials and processes, giving rise to the entitlement to payment of the running royalties.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 27¬†August 2008, Genentech notified Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis of the termination of the licence agreement, which was to take effect two months later.¬†(¬†[4](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0004)¬†)\n\n12.\n\nOn 24¬†October 2008, believing that Genentech had used the enhancer in the synthesis of recombinant proteins in order to manufacture Rituxan¬Æ¬†(¬†[5](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0005)¬†) and other medicinal products without paying the running royalties on the sale of all those medicinal products and had thus infringed the licence agreement, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis lodged an application for arbitration against Genentech with the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (‚ÄòICC‚Äô) pursuant to the arbitration clause in Article¬†11 of the licence agreement. The ICC registered that application under case number¬†15900/JHN/GFG.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27¬†October 2008, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis brought an action before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Genentech and Biogen (formerly Biogen Idec) for infringement of patents US 522 and US 140. On the same day, Genentech and Biogen brought an action for revocation of those patents before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n14.\n\nThese two actions were joined before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n15.\n\nOn 11¬†March 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held, in essence, that there was no infringement of the patents in question and dismissed the action for revocation of the patents, finding that Genentech had not met the required threshold of proof. That decision was upheld on 22¬†March 2012 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and became final.\n\n16.\n\nBy the third partial award of 5¬†September 2012 (‚Äòthe third partial award‚Äô),¬†(¬†[6](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0006)¬†) the sole arbitrator chosen by the parties held¬†(¬†[7](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0007)¬†) that Genentech had manufactured Rituxan¬Æ¬†using the enhancer ‚Äòrightly or wrongly patented for some time in [patent EP 177] and later in [patents US 522 and¬†140] ‚Ä¶‚Äô¬†(¬†[8](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0008)¬†) and, on that basis, found that Genentech was required to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis the running royalties on the sale of Rituxan¬Æ¬†and products with the same properties.¬†(¬†[9](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0009)¬†)\n\n17.\n\nThe sole arbitrator held that, originally, Genentech had wanted to use the enhancer without being regarded as an infringer,¬†(¬†[10](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0010)¬†) hence the licence agreement. It followed, according to the sole arbitrator, that the commercial purpose of the licence agreement¬†(¬†[11](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0011)¬†) was to avert all litigation on the validity of patents US 522 and US 140 during the period of validity of the licence agreement.¬†(¬†[12](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0012)¬†) In the arbitrator‚Äôs opinion, ‚Äòsuch a truce [could] not last forever since the [licence agreement was] subject to being terminated on relatively short notice by either party ‚Ä¶‚Äô.¬†(¬†[13](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0013)¬†)\n\n18.\n\nHe took the view that, once a patent has been registered, a licensee such as Genentech could be comforted by securing a licence for the use of the patent, unlike a third party who might be deterred from competing with a licensee. The sole arbitrator therefore considered that, under the licence agreement, the registration of the patents was a relevant consideration in order to establish the existence of a commercial purpose for concluding the agreement at issue, even if the question of the validity of the patents was not. He pointed out that a patent dispute could last for years, as evidenced by the parallel disputes in the United States, and incur considerable costs.¬†(¬†[14](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0014)¬†) A company such as Genentech therefore had an interest in concluding such an agreement.\n\n19.\n\nConsequently, the sole arbitrator held that any payments made under the licence agreement could not be reclaimed and any payments due thereunder remained due where the patent had been revoked or was not infringed by the licensee‚Äôs activity.¬†(¬†[15](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0015)¬†) Since the commercial purpose of the licence agreement was to avert all patent litigation, he took the view that the ultimate outcome of the patent proceedings did not require the licensor to refund the royalties received if the patent was found to be invalid. Nor did it release the licensee from its obligation to pay those royalties if, as in Genentech‚Äôs case, it had withheld them.\n\n20.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, the sole arbitrator held that, under the licence agreement, Genentech was required to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis the running royalties on the sales of Rituxan¬Æ¬†manufactured between 15¬†December 1998 (when patent US 522 was issued) and 28¬†October 2008 (when the licence agreement was terminated).¬†(¬†[16](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0016)¬†)\n\n21.\n\nHe also ordered Genentech to pay Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis EUR¬†391420.36 plus USD¬†293565.27 (around EUR¬†260000) in respect of their representation costs for the period between 9¬†June 2011 and 5¬†September 2012.\n\n22.\n\nLastly, he reserved the decisions on the assessment of the quantum of the royalties owed, on the arbitration costs and on other representation costs for the final award.\n\n23.\n\nOn 25¬†February 2013, the sole arbitrator issued his final award in which he ordered Genentech to pay Hoechst EUR¬†108322850 plus simple interest in respect of damages, EUR¬†211250 in respect of arbitration costs, and EUR¬†634649.88 plus USD¬†555907.23 (around EUR¬†490778) in respect of representation costs.¬†(¬†[17](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0017)¬†)\n\n24.\n\nIn paragraph¬†219 of the final award, the sole arbitrator finds that, late on in the proceedings, Genentech argued that ‚ÄòHoechst‚Äôs efforts to interpret [the licence agreement] so as to enable it to recover running royalties without taking account of whether or not the supposedly licensed products [were] covered by the licensed patents infringed the¬†antitrust rules of the European Union‚Äô.\n\n25.\n\nIn this connection, the sole arbitrator held that ‚ÄòGenentech [had] not explain[ed]¬†how¬†[EU competition law would be] infringed ‚Ä¶ [were it to lose] this arbitration. German licence law permits licence agreements for the purpose of using non-patented know-how and may provide for royalties to that end. This cannot be altered by claiming¬†‚Äî without providing any further arguments¬†‚Äî that the licence infringes [EU competition law]‚Äô.¬†(¬†[18](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0018)¬†)\n\n26.\n\nGenentech brought an action before the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) under Articles¬†1518 and¬†1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking annulment of the third partial award, the final award and the addendum.\n\n27.\n\nBy order of 3¬†October 2013, la cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) dismissed Genentech‚Äôs application for joinder of the actions for annulment of the third partial award, the final award and the addendum.\n\n28.\n\nIn the context of the proceedings for annulment of the third partial award, the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) questions whether the licence agreement is compatible with Article¬†101 TFEU.¬†It observes that the sole arbitrator considered that, during the period of validity of the licence agreement, the licensee was bound to pay the royalties stipulated in the contract even though the revocation of the patent or patents had retroactive effect. It enquires whether such an agreement contravenes the provisions of Article¬†101 TFEU, in so far as it requires the licensee to pay royalties now without cause on account of the revocation of the patent or patents attached to the rights granted and places the licensee at a ‚Äòcompetitive disadvantage‚Äô.\n\n29.\n\nIn those circumstances, the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚ÄòMust the provisions of Article¬†101 TFEU be interpreted as precluding effect being given, where patents are revoked, to a licence agreement which requires the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patent?‚Äô\n\n30.\n\nBy order of 18¬†November 2015, the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) (France) declared inadmissible the appeal lodged by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis against the judgment of the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 23¬†September 2014 referring a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\nIV¬†‚Äì¬†Procedure before the Court\n\n31.\n\nThis request for a preliminary ruling was lodged at the Court Registry on 9¬†December 2014. Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French, Spanish and Netherlands Governments and the European Commission submitted written observations.\n\n32.\n\nUnder Article¬†61(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the parties were invited to answer the Court‚Äôs questions in writing, which they did on 18¬†December 2015.\n\n33.\n\nAt the hearing held on 20¬†January 2016, Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French, Spanish and Netherlands Governments and the Commission made oral submissions.\n\nV¬†‚Äì¬†Assessment\n\nA¬†‚Äì¬†Admissibility\n\n1.¬†The link between the question referred and the actual facts of the dispute in the main proceedings\n\n34.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as the French Government submit that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is based on an incorrect factual premiss. Although it concerns the compatibility of the licence agreement with Article¬†101 TFEU ‚Äòwhere¬†patents¬†are revoked‚Äô,¬†(¬†[19](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0019)¬†) only patent EP 177 was revoked on 12¬†January 1999; patents US 522 and US 140 were not.¬†(¬†[20](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0020)¬†) The question referred for a preliminary ruling is therefore devoid of purpose and should be declared inadmissible.\n\n35.\n\nIn my opinion, the fact that the national court refers, in the question raised, to the revocation of ‚Äòpatents‚Äô (in the plural) even though only one patent was revoked does not mean that the request for a preliminary ruling is based on an incorrect factual premiss.\n\n36.\n\nIt is clearly apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is well aware of the fact that patents US 522 and US 140 have not been not revoked.\n\n37.\n\nIn that regard, the national court states in page 2 of its request for a preliminary ruling that the technology covered by the licence agreement ‚Äògave rise to the issue of several patents: European Patent [EP 177] of 22¬†April 1992,¬†subsequently revoked¬†on 12¬†January 1999 by the European Patent Office for lack of novelty, American Patent [US 520] of 15¬†December 1998 and American Patent [US 140] of 17¬†April 2001‚Äô.¬†(¬†[21](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0021)¬†) The national court makes no reference to the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140.\n\n38.\n\nFurthermore, in page 3 of the request for a preliminary ruling, the national court refers to the judgment of 11¬†March 2011 of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California which, it submits, ‚Äòheld that Rituxan¬Æ¬†did not constitute an infringement of the patents at issue‚Äô. It follows that the national court is aware of the content of that judgment which also dismissed the action for revocation lodged against patents US 522 and US 140.¬†(¬†[22](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0022)¬†)\n\n39.\n\nLastly, even though the sole arbitrator referred in paragraphs¬†193 and¬†194 of the third partial award to the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, this error does not appear anywhere in the final award. On the contrary, in paragraph¬†50 of the final award, the sole arbitrator very clearly states that Genentech‚Äôs action for the revocation of patents US 522 and US 140 was dismissed.\n\n40.\n\nWhilst it is true that the three actions for annulment brought before the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) against the third partial award, the final award and the addendum are not joined,¬†(¬†[23](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0023)¬†) the documents before the Court clearly show that the three actions are related. In its request for a preliminary ruling, the national court itself treats these three judgments as one and the same.¬†(¬†[24](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0024)¬†) It is therefore clear that there is no incorrect factual premiss.\n\n41.\n\nIn any event, the existence or otherwise of the allegedly incorrect factual premiss has no bearing on my proposed answer to the question referred by the national court, which concerns both the revocation of a patent (in this case, patent EP 177) as well as the non-infringement of a patent (in this case, patents US 522 and US 140).\n\n42.\n\nAs the Commission pointed out in its replies to the written questions put by the Court, ‚Äòthe sole arbitrator held in the third partial award that the purpose of the [licence] agreement was not to make provision for the reimbursement of royalties or to prevent such royalties being claimed where the patents subsequently proved to be invalid or not infringed. The purpose of the agreement, interpreted in the light of German law and the history of negotiations between the parties, was to protect the user of the patent(s)¬†‚Äî namely Genentech¬†‚Äî against litigation concerning the patent(s) which could be protracted and costly. Accordingly, the fact that the US patents might be regarded as invalid or not infringed does not alter the extent of Genentech‚Äôs obligation to pay the royalties‚Äô.\n\n2.¬†The possibility for the Court to give a useful answer to the national court\n\n43.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as the French Government submit that the Court is unable to give a useful answer to the national court.\n\n44.\n\nThe French Government argues that the request for a preliminary ruling does not set out the matters of fact and law required in the context of the application of Article¬†101 TFEU and, in particular, Commission Regulation (EC) No¬†772/2004 of 27¬†April 2004 on the application of Article [101](3) [TFEU] to categories of technology transfer agreements,¬†(¬†[25](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0025)¬†) such as the actual circumstances of the functioning and structure of the market in issue, the nature of the licence agreement as a contract between competitors or a reciprocal agreement, and the aspects of German law applicable to that agreement.\n\n45.\n\nIn my opinion, these arguments must be rejected because I find that, in accordance with the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), Article¬†101(1) and¬†(2) TFEU do not require the annulment of the third partial award.¬†(¬†[26](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0026)¬†) The exemption regulations¬†(¬†[27](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0027)¬†) mentioned by the French Government apply Article¬†101(3) TFEU to categories of technology transfer agreements and corresponding concerted practices to which only two undertakings are party,¬†falling within Article¬†101(1) TFEU. That is not the case here.\n\n46.\n\nIn any event, I do not think that the Court would have sufficient information to conduct such an analysis, if it does not agree with my finding.\n\n47.\n\nThe plea of inadmissibility relating to the application of those exemption regulations could only be upheld if the Court were to disagree with my finding.\n\n3.¬†The power of the national court to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling\n\n48.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis submit that it is impossible to answer the question referred for a preliminary ruling without infringing French law which prevents international arbitral awards being reviewed as to their substance except where there is a flagrant infringement of international public policy.¬†(¬†[28](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0028)¬†)\n\n49.\n\nFailing such a flagrant infringement (as in the case of a cartel), Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis draw a distinction between situations where the question of the compatibility of an agreement between undertakings with Article¬†101 TFEU was not addressed in the international arbitral award, thereby endangering the effectiveness of competition law, and situations where this question was indeed raised in the award. In their opinion, in the second situation which arises in the present case, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling would make it necessary for the national court to review the third partial award as to its substance, since the ground for annulment forming the subject matter of this question was raised and debated before the sole arbitrator.\n\n50.\n\nI recall that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts, as provided for in Article¬†267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case pending before it both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court.\n\n51.\n\nWhere questions referred by national courts concern the interpretation of a provision of EU law, the Court is thus bound, in principle, to give a ruling unless it is obvious that the request for a preliminary ruling is in reality designed to induce the Court to give a ruling by means of a fictitious dispute, or to deliver advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions, or that the interpretation of EU law requested bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, or that the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it.¬†(¬†[29](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0029)¬†)\n\n52.\n\nIn my opinion, there is no evidence to suggest that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is hypothetical or that the interpretation of EU law requested bears no relation to the actual facts or purpose of the main action pending before the national court, which concerns Article¬†101 TFEU.¬†Furthermore, I consider that the Court has before it the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the question referred.\n\n53.\n\nI also note, purely for information, that the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) declared inadmissible the appeal lodged by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis against the judgment of the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 23¬†September 2014 referring the present question to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n\n54.\n\nConsequently, the question referred for a preliminary ruling is admissible and must be answered.\n\nB¬†‚Äì¬†Substance\n\n1.¬†The scope of the review of international arbitral awards in the light of European public policy rules\n\n55.\n\nIn its written observations, the French Government recalls that, in paragraph¬†32 of the judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that the review by Member States‚Äô courts of international arbitral awards raising questions of EU law may be ‚Äòmore or less extensive depending on the circumstances‚Äô, according to the rules adopted by the Member States within the framework of their procedural autonomy. On that basis, the French Government submits that the rules of French law under which the French courts are unable to review international arbitral awards as to their substance and are confined, in the context of an action for annulment of an international arbitral award such as that at issue in the present case, to examining ‚Äòflagrant‚Äô infringements¬†(¬†[30](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0030)¬†) of international public policy, are consistent with the principle of effectiveness laid down in EU law.\n\n56.\n\nHoechst and Sanofi-Aventis submit¬†(¬†[31](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0031)¬†) that, even though, in its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that a national court hearing an action for annulment of an international arbitral award was required, in accordance with its internal rules of procedure, to uphold an action for annulment based on an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU, the French rules of procedure at issue prevent any review of international arbitral awards as to their substance and limit the scope of that review to cases of ‚Äòflagrant‚Äô infringements.¬†(¬†[32](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0032)¬†)\n\n57.\n\nAccording to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, since the question of the possible incompatibility of the licence agreement with Article¬†101 TFEU was raised and debated before the sole arbitrator and was rejected by him, it is impossible to answer the question referred for a preliminary ruling without reviewing the third partial award as to its substance, in so far as a licence agreement such as that at issue in this case cannot constitute a restriction by object under Article¬†101 TFEU and cannot, therefore, constitute a flagrant infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU.\n\n58.\n\nIn my opinion, limitations on the scope¬†(¬†[33](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0033)¬†) of the review of international arbitral awards such as those under French law mentioned by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis as well as by the French Government¬†‚Äî namely the flagrant nature of the infringement of international public policy and the impossibility of reviewing an international arbitral award on the ground of such an infringement where the question of public policy was raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal¬†‚Äî are contrary to the principle of effectiveness of EU law.\n\n59.\n\nReferring to the system for reviewing the compatibility of international arbitral awards with EU law through the public policy reservation, as established by the Court in its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab))¬†‚Äî which concerned, as in this case, an action for annulment of an international arbitral award based on an infringement of public policy and was confirmed by the judgment in Gazprom ([C‚Äë536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2015:316](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), involving an application for the recognition and enforcement of an international arbitral award disputed on public policy grounds¬†‚Äî the Court has held that arbitral tribunals ‚Äòconstituted pursuant to an agreement‚Äô¬†(¬†[34](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0034)¬†) are not courts of the Member States within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU.¬†Consequently, they cannot refer questions for a preliminary ruling. It is therefore for the courts of the Member States, within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU, to examine, if necessary by referring a question for a preliminary ruling,¬†(¬†[35](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0035)¬†) the compatibility of (international or¬†domestic) arbitral awards with EU law where an action is brought before them for annulment¬†(¬†[36](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0036)¬†) or enforcement,¬†(¬†[37](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0037)¬†) or where any other form of action or review is sought under the relevant national legislation.\n\n60.\n\nIn other words, the system for reviewing the compatibility of international arbitral awards with substantive EU law through the public policy reservation, whether in the context of an action against recognition and enforcement or an action for annulment, shifts responsibility for the review downstream, namely to the courts of the Member States, rather than upstream, to arbitral tribunals.¬†(¬†[38](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0038)¬†)\n\n61.\n\nThe task of arbitrators in international commercial arbitration is to interpret and apply the contract binding the parties correctly. In the performance of this task, arbitrators may naturally find it necessary to apply EU law, if it forms part of the law applicable to the contract (lex contractus) or the law applicable to the arbitration (lex arbitri). However, the responsibility for reviewing compliance with European public policy rules lies with the courts of the Member States and not with arbitrators, whether in the context of an action for annulment or proceedings for recognition and enforcement.¬†(¬†[39](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0039)¬†)\n\n62.\n\nThis system is therefore the opposite of the system of mutual trust established, in particular, by Regulation (EU) No¬†1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12¬†December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters,¬†(¬†[40](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0040)¬†) which entrusts responsibility for ensuring compliance with EU law, applicable to the substance of the dispute, including European public policy rules, to the court hearing the substance of the dispute (the upstream court), and not the downstream court of recognition and enforcement.¬†(¬†[41](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0041)¬†)\n\n63.\n\nOn that basis, I will examine the two limitations imposed by French law.\n\na)¬†The flagrant or manifest nature of the infringement of public policy\n\n64.\n\nIf the review of an international arbitral award in the light of European public policy rules (which cover only a very narrow category of rules in the EU legal order) had to be limited to manifest or flagrant infringements of Article¬†101 TFEU, this review would be illusory since agreements or practices liable to restrict or distort competition are ‚Äòfrequently covert‚Äô,¬†(¬†[42](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0042)¬†) which would, in many cases, make it impossible (or excessively difficult) for individuals to exercise the rights conferred on them by EU competition law.\n\n65.\n\nAs Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis conceded in paragraph¬†21 of their written observations, along with their legal expert in paragraph¬†5 of her opinion,¬†(¬†[43](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0043)¬†) the effect of this extremely limited review would be that it would cover only ‚Äòthe most obvious infringements [of Article¬†101 TFEU], such as price-fixing or market-sharing agreements‚Äô. Restrictions by effect would therefore completely evade review by the courts hearing actions for annulment, since a finding that such restrictions exist would require more than a token examination of the substance of the arbitral award, which the French courts are unable to do.\n\n66.\n\nEven if there were a scale of infringements of Article¬†101 TFEU based on their obviousness and harmfulness including, in particular, restrictions by object and by effect,¬†(¬†[44](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0044)¬†) there is nothing in Article¬†101 TFEU to support the conclusion that these restrictions would be permissible. Indeed, Article¬†101 TFEU expressly prohibits agreements between undertakings ‚Äòwhich have as their object or effect‚Äô¬†(¬†[45](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0045)¬†) the restriction of competition. Accordingly, either there is an infringement of Article¬†101 TFEU, in which case the agreement between undertakings at issue is automatically void, or there is no infringement at all.\n\n67.\n\nConsequently, it makes no difference whether the infringement of the public policy rule was flagrant or not. No system can accept infringements of its most fundamental rules making up its public policy, irrespective of whether or not those infringements are flagrant or obvious.\n\nb)¬†The impossibility of reviewing an international arbitral award on the ground of infringement of public policy where the question was raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal, because this would entail a review of the award as to its substance\n\n68.\n\nIn paragraph¬†36 of its judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that Article¬†101 TFEU (formerly Article¬†81 EC) constituted ‚Äòa fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the [EU] and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market‚Äô.¬†(¬†[46](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0046)¬†)\n\n69.\n\nIn addition, in paragraph¬†37 of the judgment in Gazprom ([C‚Äë536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2015:316](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A316\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court held that the principle of mutual trust is not binding on arbitral tribunals.¬†(¬†[47](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0047)¬†) This means that the courts of the Member States are not bound to comply with the answers to questions concerning EU law given by arbitral tribunals, which are not courts of the Member States within the meaning of Article¬†267 TFEU.\n\n70.\n\nConsequently, if Article¬†101 TFEU is a provision of fundamental importance to the EU legal order, the fact that the parties may have raised and debated the question of the incompatibility of the arbitral award with this provision before the arbitral tribunal cannot be decisive. This is because the conduct of the parties during the arbitration proceedings could have the effect of undermining the effectiveness of that article, since the arbitral tribunal is unable in principle¬†(¬†[48](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0048)¬†) to submit a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling and is not necessarily tasked with interpreting and applying EU law.\n\n71.\n\nFor these reasons, the review by a court of a Member State of whether international arbitral awards are contrary to European public policy rules cannot be conditioned by whether or not this question was raised or debated during the arbitration proceedings, nor can it be limited by the prohibition under national law preventing the substance of the award in issue from being reconsidered.\n\n72.\n\nPut another way, one or more parties to agreements which might be regarded as anticompetitive cannot put these agreements beyond the reach of review under Articles¬†101 TFEU and¬†102 TFEU by resorting to arbitration.\n\n2.¬†Does Article¬†101(1) TFEU require the annulment of an international arbitral award such as that at issue in the main proceedings which gives effect to a patent licence agreement providing for the payment of royalties for the entire duration of the agreement, even in the event of the revocation with retroactive effect of a patent covering the technology concerned (in this case, patent EP 177) or where the use of the technology at issue does not entail any infringement (patents US 522 and US 140)?\n\na)¬†Preliminary remarks\n\n73.\n\nIt is apparent from reading the third partial award and the sole arbitrator‚Äôs interpretation of the licence agreement that Genentech‚Äôs obligation to pay running royalties to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, calculated on the basis of their production of medicinal products using the technology of the enhancer, was not conditional on that technology being or remaining patent protected.¬†(¬†[49](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0049)¬†)\n\n74.\n\nAccording to the third partial award, the mere use of the technology at issue during the term of the licence agreement was sufficient to trigger the obligation to pay running royalties.¬†(¬†[50](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0050)¬†)\n\n75.\n\nIn this respect, it is not for the Court to review or call in question the findings of the sole arbitrator and his interpretation of the licence agreement under German law, according to which the licence agreement required royalties to be paid notwithstanding the revocation or non-infringement of one or more patents.\n\n76.\n\nFurthermore, the national court‚Äôs question only concerns the interpretation of Article¬†101 TFEU, rendering Genentech‚Äôs references to the judgment in Huawei Technologies ([C‚Äë170/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:2391](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) and to some passages of my Opinion¬†(¬†[51](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0051)¬†) in that case, which relate exclusively to Article¬†102 TFEU, pointless.\n\nb)¬†Arguments of the parties\n\n77.\n\nFor Genentech, the obligation imposed by the third partial award to pay the running royalties at issue where the patent is revoked or where there is no infringement of a licensed patent not only significantly affects trade between Member States, but also constitutes a restriction on competition by both object and effect.\n\n78.\n\nAs regards the effect on trade between Member States, Genentech maintains that, on 2¬†June 1998, the Commission granted EU-wide marketing authorisation for MabThera¬Æ¬†under Council Regulation (EEC) No¬†2309/93 of 22¬†July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.¬†(¬†[52](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0052)¬†) According to Genentech, during the relevant period (1998 to¬†2008), it manufactured ‚Äòrituximab‚Äô with a view to it being marketed in different Member States, mainly the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It notes that the royalties awarded by the sole arbitrator were calculated on the basis of net worldwide sales of finished products for the period between 1998 and¬†2008 and that, in view of the high volume of sales in the European Union during the relevant period, the restriction on competition resulting from the payment ordered by the sole arbitrator directly affects trade between Member States.\n\n79.\n\nGenentech also explains that it is at a competitive disadvantage on the market, since it is required to pay for the use of a technology which its competitors can take advantage of freely and without charge.\n\n80.\n\nFurthermore, Genentech submits that Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis were rewarded and unjustly enriched by receiving¬†(¬†[53](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0053)¬†) running royalties in respect of scientific and technological discoveries to which they contributed nothing. It claims that the international arbitration awards at issue in the main proceedings enabled Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis to ‚Äòtax‚Äô their competitors and impose a financial burden on the pharmaceutical industry in general and on Genentech and its subsidiaries in particular, which pursue their business both in Europe and in the rest of the world, in contravention of EU competition law.\n\n81.\n\nAs regards competition in the strict sense, Genentech claims that Sanofi-Aventis is the second largest pharmaceutical group in Europe in terms of revenue for prescription medicines and is involved in research and development as well as the manufacture of medicinal products in several therapeutic areas. It also states that Sanofi-Aventis is one of the main competitors of Roche (which currently wholly owns Genentech) in the research-based field of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n82.\n\nBy contrast, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis argue that the arbitral awards disputed by Genentech have only a very weak link to the European Union.\n\n83.\n\nThey also submit that the royalties owed by Genentech do not derive from any European patent and that the international arbitral awards in dispute do not have even the slightest impact on Genentech‚Äôs sales. Furthermore, they claim that the sole arbitrator ruled on the single question whether Genentech was contractually bound to pay the royalties provided for in the licence agreement and that the royalties awarded to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis in the final award were calculated on the basis of worldwide sales of Rituxan¬Æ, only 17% of which related to the European Union, corresponding to approximately EUR¬†18¬†million during the period at issue between 1998 and¬†2008.\n\nc)¬†Assessment\n\n84.\n\nConcerning the assessment of the effect on trade between Member States, I concur with the Commission‚Äôs observations in its replies to the written questions put by the Court that it is for the national court to determine whether, in the light of the characteristics of the market at issue, it is sufficiently likely that the obligation to pay royalties, in compliance with the final award and under the licence agreement, exerts a direct or indirect, actual or potential influence on the movement of trade between the Member States, and that this influence is not insignificant.¬†(¬†[54](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0054)¬†)\n\n85.\n\nAs regards the restriction on competition, the question here is not whether Genentech was commercially disadvantaged by the sole arbitrator‚Äôs interpretation of the licence agreement or whether, with the (indisputable) benefit of hindsight, it would not have entered into such an agreement.¬†(¬†[55](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055)¬†) The aim of Article¬†101 TFEU is not to regulate commercial relations between undertakings in a general way, but rather to prohibit some types of agreements between them which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition, in its judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the Court examined in the light of competition law a contractual obligation under which the licensee of a patented invention was required to pay a royalty for an indeterminate period, and thus even after the expiry of the patent.\n\n87.\n\nIn paragraphs¬†11 and¬†12 of the judgment, the Court held:\n\n‚ÄòThe possibility cannot be ruled out that the reason for the inclusion in a licensing agreement of a clause imposing an obligation to pay royalty¬†may be unconnected with a patent. Such a clause may instead reflect¬†a commercial assessment¬†of the value to be attributed to the possibilities of exploitation granted by the licensing agreement. ‚Ä¶\n\nWhere the obligation to pay royalty was entered into for an indeterminate period and thus purports to bind the licensee even after the expiry of the patent concerned, the question arises whether, having regard to the economic and legal context of the licensing agreement, the obligation to continue to pay royalty might constitute a restriction of competition of the kind referred to in Article [101](1).‚Äô¬†(¬†[56](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0056)¬†)\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Court, the obligation at issue may infringe Article¬†101(1) TFEU where the licence agreement either does not grant the licensee the right to terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice or seeks to restrict the licensee‚Äôs freedom of action after termination.¬†(¬†[57](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0057)¬†)\n\n89.\n\nAlthough it is true that that judgment covered slightly different economic and legal circumstances from those at issue in the main proceedings,¬†(¬†[58](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0058)¬†) I consider that the case-law can be applied to the present case by analogy.\n\n90.\n\nThe third partial award confirms the fact that Genentech‚Äôs obligation to pay royalties flowed not from the use of a technology protected by valid patents, but from the licence agreement alone.¬†(¬†[59](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059)¬†) The sole arbitrator‚Äôs interpretation of the licence agreement under German law clearly shows that the commercial purpose of the agreement was to enable Genentech to use the enhancer at issue while averting patent litigation. Since Genentech, unlike other users of the enhancer who did not conclude a licence agreement with Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, actually benefited from this ‚Äòtemporary truce‚Äô¬†(¬†[60](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0060)¬†) for the duration of the licence agreement, the payments for using the enhancer, owed by Genentech under the agreement, were not reimbursable notwithstanding the absence of infringement or the revocation of the patents at issue.\n\n91.\n\nFurthermore, the obligation to pay royalties was stipulated to last only for the duration of the validity of the licence agreement and Genentech was freely able to terminate it by giving very short notice of two months.¬†(¬†[61](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0061)¬†) As soon as the licence agreement was terminated, Genentech was therefore in exactly the same position as all other users of the enhancer at issue.¬†(¬†[62](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0062)¬†)\n\n92.\n\nI also note that Genentech‚Äôs freedom of action was not restricted in any way during the period after termination and it was not subject to any clause preventing it from challenging the validity or the infringement of the patents at issue. Indeed, following the termination of the licence agreement, Genentech brought proceedings to revoke the patents before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n93.\n\nGenentech nevertheless submits that the judgment in Windsurfing International v Commission ([193/83](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1986:75](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) demonstrates that Article¬†101(1) TFEU is infringed if the holder of a patent licence is required to pay royalties calculated on the basis of the net selling price of a product which is not covered by the patent.\n\n94.\n\nIn that judgment, the Court held that, in principle, this method of calculating royalties based on the net selling price of a complete sailboard was of such a nature as to restrict competition with regard to boards which were not covered by a patent.¬†(¬†[63](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0063)¬†) The Court noted, in paragraph¬†65 of its judgment, that the demand for rigs and for boards was separate.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, in that judgment the patent holder had, by means of the clause at issue and in contravention of Article¬†101(1)(e) TFEU, made the conclusion of the agreement conditional on the acceptance, by its partner, of supplementary obligations¬†(¬†[64](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0064)¬†) which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, had no connection with the subject matter of the agreement. In the main proceedings, there is no evidence to suggest that the enforcement of the third partial award would have had the effect of imposing obligations on Genentech which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, would have had no connection with the subject matter of the licence agreement.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the sole arbitrator, the commercial purpose of the licence agreement was to avert patent litigation and, in consequence, the calculation of royalties was wholly independent of the existence or otherwise of a valid patent over the finished product.\n\n97.\n\nConsequently, I consider that Article¬†101 TFEU does not preclude effect being given, in the event of revocation or non-infringement of patents protecting a technology, to a licence agreement which requires the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patents where, first, the commercial purpose of the agreement is to enable the licensee to use the technology at issue while averting patent litigation and, secondly, the licensee may terminate the licence agreement by giving reasonable notice, even in the event of revocation or non-infringement.\n\n3.¬†Applicability of the exemption regulations on technology transfer\n\n98.\n\nGenentech, Hoechst, Sanofi-Aventis, the Netherlands Government and the Commission filed observations on the application of the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No¬†316/2014 of 21¬†March 2014 on the application of Article¬†101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of technology transfer agreements.¬†(¬†[65](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0065)¬†)\n\n99.\n\nBy contrast, the French Government submits that, since the question referred for a preliminary ruling concerns the implementation of the licence agreement between 15¬†December 1998 and 27¬†October 2008, Commission Regulation (EC) No¬†240/96 of 31¬†January 1996 on the application of Article [101](3) [TFEU] to certain categories of technology transfer agreements¬†(¬†[66](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0066)¬†) and Regulation No¬†772/2004 should be applied for the period at issue.\n\n100.\n\nIn my opinion, it is not appropriate to examine the applicability of these three ‚Äòexemption‚Äô regulations in the present case.\n\n101.\n\nBesides the fact that the Court does not have sufficient information in order to conduct such an analysis, there is no need to do so because I consider that, in accordance with the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), Article¬†101(1) and¬†(2) TFEU does not require the annulment of the third partial award. I note that these exemption regulations apply Article¬†101(3) TFEU¬†(¬†[67](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0067)¬†) to categories of technology transfer agreements and corresponding concerted practices to which only two undertakings are party,¬†falling within Article¬†101(1) TFEU.\n\n102.\n\nI also consider, for the sake of completeness, that it is necessary to reject Genentech‚Äôs observations that its obligation, in compliance with the third partial award, to pay royalties on the basis of all sales of MabThera¬Æ¬†constitutes a hardcore restriction under Article¬†4(1)(a) and¬†(d) of Regulation No¬†316/2014.\n\n103.\n\nThe documents before the Court do not show that the object or effect of the licence agreement and the third partial award is to restrict Genentech‚Äôs ability to determine its prices when selling products to third parties¬†(¬†[68](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0068)¬†) or to restrict its ability ‚Äòto exploit its own technology rights‚Äô or ‚Äòto carry out research and development‚Äô.¬†(¬†[69](#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0069)¬†)\n\nVI¬†‚Äì¬†Conclusion\n\n104.\n\nI therefore propose that the Court should give the following answer to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris):\n\nArticle¬†101 TFEU does not require, in the event of revocation or non-infringement of patents protecting a technology, the annulment of an international arbitral award giving effect to a licence agreement which obliges the licensee to pay royalties for the sole use of the rights attached to the licensed patents where the commercial purpose of the agreement is to enable the licensee to use the technology at issue while averting patent litigation, provided that the licensee is able to terminate the licence agreement by giving reasonable notice, is able to challenge the validity or infringement of the patents, and retains his freedom of action after termination.\n\n---\n\n(¬†[1](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0001)¬†) Original language: French.\n\n(¬†[2](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0002)¬†) Behringwerke subsequently assigned its rights to Hoechst. Hoechst has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis since July 2005.\n\n(¬†[3](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0003)¬†) Defined in the licence agreement as ‚Äòcommercially marketable goods incorporating a licensed product, sold in a form enabling them to be administered to patients for therapeutic purposes or to be used in a diagnostic procedure, and which are not intended or marketed for reformulation, processing, repackaging or relabeling before use‚Äô. Under the terms of the agreement, ‚Äòlicensed products‚Äô are ‚Äòmaterials (including organisms) in respect of which the manufacture, use or sale would, in the absence of this agreement, infringe one or more unexpired claims included in the rights attached to the patents under licence‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[4](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0004)¬†) Article¬†8(3) of the licence agreement provides that ‚Äòthe licensee may terminate this agreement and the licences granted pursuant hereto by giving Behringwerke two (2) months‚Äô notice for that purpose, if the licensee decides to stop using the licence rights conferred hereunder‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[5](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0005)¬†) The active ingredient of Rituxan¬Æ¬†is rituximab. Since 1998, this medicinal product has been marketed in the United States under the trade name Rituxan¬Æ¬†and in the European Union under the trade name MabThera¬Æ. It is apparent from the answers provided by Genentech as well as by Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis to the written questions put by the Court that the arbitral awards at issue in this case concern worldwide sales of Rituxan¬Æ, including the sales of this medicinal product under the name ‚ÄòMabThera¬Æ‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[6](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0006)¬†) Footnote not relevant to the English version of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[7](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0007)¬†) See paragraphs¬†322 to¬†330 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[8](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0008)¬†) See paragraph¬†326 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[9](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0009)¬†) See paragraph¬†114 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[10](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0010)¬†) See paragraph¬†299 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[11](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0011)¬†) The sole arbitrator considered that, under German law, which applies to the licence agreement, contracts should be interpreted not only on the basis of their wording, but also on the basis of their genesis, their systematic context and their commercial purpose (see, to that effect, paragraph¬†255 of the third partial award). He found that the commercial reason that led the parties to enter into the licence agreement was that, when the agreement was concluded, Behringwerke had a patented invention (namely patent EP 177) which Genentech wished to make commercial use of without running the risk of infringing the patent (see, to that effect, paragraph¬†258 of the third partial award). According to the sole arbitrator, the question of the validity of the patent was not relevant under German law, which recognises the contractual right to royalty payments in a licence agreement even if the patent at issue is ultimately revoked. He held that, pursuant to German law, a person could also grant a licence in respect of an invention that was not patented or not patentable (see, to that effect, paragraph¬†292 of the third partial award).\n\n(¬†[12](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0012)¬†) See, to that effect, paragraph¬†307 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[13](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0013)¬†) See paragraph¬†308 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[14](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0014)¬†) See paragraph¬†313 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[15](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0015)¬†) See paragraph¬†314 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[16](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0016)¬†) See, to that effect, paragraph¬†161 and point¬†1 of the operative part of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[17](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0017)¬†) These amounts were not altered by the decision and the addendum to the final award issued on 25¬†February 2013, which concerned the calculation of interest owed by Genentech to Hoechst (‚Äòthe addendum‚Äô).\n\n(¬†[18](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0018)¬†) See paragraph¬†222 of the final award.\n\n(¬†[19](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0019)¬†) My emphasis.\n\n(¬†[20](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0020)¬†) See point¬†6 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[21](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0021)¬†) My emphasis.\n\n(¬†[22](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0022)¬†) See points¬†13 to¬†15 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[23](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0023)¬†) See point¬†27 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[24](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0024)¬†) See, in particular, Genentech‚Äôs heads of claim before the national court (reproduced in the request for a preliminary ruling) which seek the annulment of the third partial award, the definitive award and the addendum.\n\n(¬†[25](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0025)¬†)¬†[OJ 2004 L¬†123, p.¬†11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2004:123:TOC).\n\n(¬†[26](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0026)¬†) See points¬†84 to¬†97 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[27](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0027)¬†) The legal basis for all three regulations at issue is Council Regulation No¬†19/65/EEC of 2¬†March 1965 on application of Article [101](3) [TFEU] to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices (OJ, English Special Edition, Series I, Volume¬†1965-1966, pp.¬†35-37).\n\n(¬†[28](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0028)¬†) See judgments of the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 18¬†November 2004 in¬†Thal√®s, RG No¬†2002/19606, p.¬†9, and Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 4¬†June 2008 in¬†Cytec, No¬†06-15.320, Bull. civ.

This approach was confirmed in¬†Cytec¬†(judgment of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 4¬†June 2008 in¬†Cytec, No¬†06-15.320, Bull. civ. I, No¬†162, p.¬†4). Both cases concerned an infringement of EU competition law.\n\n(¬†[33](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0033)¬†) Since the action for annulment concerns, in accordance with Article¬†1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure, international arbitral awards delivered in France, the subject matter of the review is the international arbitral award itself and not the underlying instrument containing the arbitration clause which gave rise to the arbitration, in this case the licence agreement. It is true that international arbitral awards are not agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article¬†101 TFEU, but international legal decisions which are not attached to any State legal order and instead fall within the scope of the international arbitral order (see judgment of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 8¬†July 2015 in¬†Ryanair, No¬†13-25.846, FR:CCASS:2015:C100797; also see, to that effect, judgments of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 23¬†March 1994 in¬†Hilmarton Ltd, No¬†92-15137, Bull. civ.

However, the judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) clearly shows that an international arbitral award must be annulled where it gives effect to an agreement between undertakings which infringes Article¬†101 TFEU, even if the award itself does not constitute an agreement between undertakings. Otherwise, the parties could put anticompetitive agreements beyond the reach of Article¬†101 TFEU by inserting arbitration clauses in those agreements.\n\n(¬†[34](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0034)¬†) See judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point34)). I use this term to avoid confusion with some arbitral tribunals which the Court has found fulfil the criteria laid down in the case-law in order to be able to refer a question for a preliminary ruling (see judgment in Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta,¬†[C‚Äë377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), and order in Merck Canada,¬†[C‚Äë555/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:92](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). Based on this case-law, the arbitral tribunals hearing cases within the framework of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) could be regarded as being able to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling.

Since the number and size of investment arbitrations raising questions on the application of EU law are increasing, particularly in the field of State aid, the possibility for arbitral tribunals to refer questions for a preliminary ruling could help to ensure the correct and effective implementation of EU law.\n\n(¬†[35](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0035)¬†) See judgment in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraphs¬†[32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point32),¬†[33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point33)¬†and¬†[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point40)).

As I explained in point¬†182 of my Opinion in Gazprom ([C‚Äë536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:2414](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), ‚ÄòI do not agree that the [judgment] in Eco Swiss ([C‚Äë126/97](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1999:269](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[36](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1999%3A269\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point36)) ‚Ä¶ should be interpreted in such a way that the mere fact that a particular sphere forms part of the exclusive or shared powers of the European Union in accordance with Articles¬†3 TFEU and¬†4 TFEU is sufficient to raise a provision of EU law to the rank of public-policy provisions. If that were the case, EU law in its entirety, from the Charter of Fundamental Rights to a directive on pressurised equipment, would be a matter of public policy ‚Ä¶‚Äô. In point¬†177 of that Opinion, I explained, by citing paragraph¬†304 of the judgment in Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission ([C‚Äë402/05¬†P and¬†C‚Äë415/05¬†P](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A461\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2008:461](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A461\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), that the notion of European public policy could only cover ‚Äòprinciples that form part of the very foundations of the [EU] legal order‚Äô to the point that their ‚Äòbreach ‚Ä¶ cannot be tolerated¬†‚Ä¶ because such a breach would be unacceptable from the viewpoint of a free and democratic State governed by the rule of law‚Äô. These are therefore ‚Äòmandatory rule[s] which [are] so¬†fundamental¬†to the [EU] legal order that [they] cannot be subject to any derogation whatsoever in the context of the case at issue‚Äô (see point¬†100 of my Opinion in Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff,¬†[C‚Äë438/14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A11\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2016:11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A11\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). Articles¬†101 TFEU and¬†102 TFEU are, in that sense, fundamental provisions which are essential for the functioning of the internal market, without which the European Union would not function and the breach of which, whether or not flagrant or obvious, would be unacceptable from the standpoint of the EU legal order.\n\n(¬†[47](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0047)¬†) Also see, to that effect, point¬†154 of my Opinion in Gazprom ([C‚Äë536/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:2414](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2414\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)).\n\n(¬†[48](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0048)¬†) See judgment in Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta ([C‚Äë377/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:1754](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A1754\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) and order in Merck Canada ([C‚Äë555/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:92](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A92\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)). In the present case, the sole arbitrator is not a ‚Äòcourt or tribunal of a Member State‚Äô within the meaning of this case-law because his jurisdiction is not binding and is instead the result of a contractual choice freely made by the parties to the licence agreement which gave rise to the arbitral awards at issue in the main proceedings.\n\n(¬†[49](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0049)¬†) In their replies to the written questions put by the Court, Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French Government and the Commission submit that the third partial award does not concern patent EP 177. The Commission argues that the two US patents (patents US 522 and US 140) are not much more relevant to the third partial award. It contends that, under the law applicable to the licence agreement, namely German law, the revocation or annulment of a patent under licence does not affect the obligation to pay royalties, adding that a licence may be granted under German law even for a technology which is not patented or not patentable. Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis state that it is clearly apparent from the third partial award that the sole arbitrator ordered Genentech to pay the royalties owed to Sanofi based exclusively on the fact that Genentech used the enhancer forming the subject matter of the licence agreement to manufacture Rituxan¬Æ¬†in the United States.\n\n(¬†[50](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0050)¬†) It is not disputed that, according to the US courts, patents US 522 and US 140 are not infringed. The sole arbitrator also found in paragraphs¬†322 to¬†330 of the third partial award that the enhancer had been used to manufacture Rituxan¬Æ¬†between 15¬†December 1998 and 27¬†October 2008. See point¬†16 of this Opinion.\n\n(¬†[51](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0051)¬†)¬†[C‚Äë170/13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:2014:2391](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2391\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab).\n\n(¬†[52](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0052)¬†)¬†[OJ 1993 L¬†214, p.¬†1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:214:TOC).\n\n(¬†[53](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0053)¬†) By order of 3¬†October 2013, the cour d‚Äôappel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) granted leave to enforce the third partial award, the final award and the addendum. The orders and rulings have therefore been enforced.\n\n(¬†[54](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0054)¬†) According to the Commission, there are factors which suggest that the obligation to pay the royalties at issue may have such an influence. ‚ÄòFirst, the geographic scope of the licence agreement is worldwide and thus includes the whole of the European Union ‚Ä¶ Secondly, the licence agreement relates to a technology which, in the [sole] arbitrator‚Äôs opinion, was used to manufacture rituximab, the active ingredient of the medicinal product MabThera¬Æ¬†marketed in the European Union. Thirdly, MabThera¬Æ¬†was the subject of marketing authorisation ‚Ä¶ under Article¬†3 of [Regulation (EEC) No¬†2309/93]. Fourthly, it appears that Genentech marketed MabThera¬Æ¬†in at least Germany, France and Italy. Fifthly, it appears that Sanofi and [Genentech, now part of the Roche group,] are major competitors in the field of pharmaceutical research and, in particular, are potential competitors within the sphere of action of Rituxan¬Æ¬†(and MabThera¬Æ). Sixthly, the obligation to pay royalties may add to Genentech‚Äôs manufacturing costs and have the effect of reducing competition on existing product and technology markets, particularly within the sphere of action of MabThera¬Æ. Seventhly, it appears that Rituxan¬Æ¬†and MabThera¬Æ¬†generate turnover in excess of one billion euros, enabling them to be regarded as ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù medicinal products.‚Äô\n\n(¬†[55](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055)¬†) As Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis observed in their replies to the written questions put by the Court, ‚Äòthe mere fact that the payment of contractual royalties owed under the licence agreement may possibly constitute a financial burden for the licensee, in this case Genentech, is not sufficient to characterise a restriction on competition. Such a burden simply illustrates the commercial nature of the licence agreement, which was concluded with complete knowledge of the facts by fully informed commercial undertakings of equal strength, and which¬†‚Äî as with all other commercial agreements¬†‚Äî may turn out to be commercially less advantageous than initially envisaged by one of the parties‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[56](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0056)¬†) My emphasis.\n\n(¬†[57](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0057)¬†) See judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point13)). Genentech considers that the Commission, in its decision of 2¬†December 1975 relating to a proceeding under Article [101 TFEU] (IV/26.949¬†‚Äî¬†AOIP¬†v¬†Beyrard) ([OJ 1976 L¬†6, p.¬†8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1976:006:TOC)), ‚Äòstated that there is a restriction on competition where a clause of a licensed patent agreement ‚Äúprovides for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor‚Äôs patents are exploited‚Äù. According to the Commission ‚Ä¶, a clause such as this in a licence agreement ‚Äúis also incompatible with Article [101](1), in the same way as the obligation to pay royalties¬†after the expiration of a patent‚Äù‚Äô (my emphasis). Genentech‚Äôs observations concern a clause which requires a licensee to pay royalties where it manufactures the products referred to in the agreement without using the licensor‚Äôs patents. In that decision, the Commission found that the clause had a restrictive effect on competition because it provided for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor‚Äôs patents were exploited. It considered that the clause at issue, like other clauses laying down an obligation to pay royalties after the expiry of a patent, was incompatible with Article¬†101(1) TFEU.¬†It should be noted that the Commission, like the Court in paragraph¬†13 of its judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), pointed out that ‚Äòthe obligation to pay royalties after the expiration of the ‚Ä¶ patent ‚Ä¶ constitutes ‚Ä¶ an infringement of Article [101]¬†because the licensee does not have the right to terminate the agreement‚Äô (my emphasis).\n\n(¬†[58](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0058)¬†) The present case concerns the revocation or non-infringement of patents while the case giving rise to the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)) concerned the expiry of patents.\n\n(¬†[59](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059)¬†) According to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the national laws of several Member States provide that, where a patent is revoked, the licensee is entitled to stop paying royalties in the future, but cannot demand reimbursement of royalties already paid.\n\n(¬†[60](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0060)¬†) See paragraph¬†315 of the third partial award.\n\n(¬†[61](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0061)¬†) In the case giving rise to the judgment in Ottung ([320/87](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1989:195](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab)), the notice period was six months expiring on 1¬†October of each year.\n\n(¬†[62](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0062)¬†) By contrast, as the Commission submits in its observations, ‚Äòan obligation to continue to pay royalties, without it being possible to terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice, would add to the licensee‚Äôs manufacturing costs without economic justification and would have the effect of reducing competition on the existing product and technology markets and deterring the licensee from investing in the development and improvement of its technology‚Äô.\n\n(¬†[63](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0063)¬†) See judgment in Windsurfing International v Commission ([193/83](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026locale=en),¬†[EU:C:1986:75](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=pdf\u0026target=CourtTab), paragraph¬†[67](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A75\u0026lang=EN\u0026format=html\u0026target=CourtTab\u0026anchor=#point67)).\n\n(¬†[64](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0064)¬†) The relevant clause of the licence agreement required the licensees to pay royalties for sailboard rigs manufactured under a patent only covering rigs based on the selling price of a complete sailboard, which was made up of rigs and boards, the latter not being covered by the patent.\n\n(¬†[65](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0065)¬†)¬†[OJ 2014 L¬†93, p.¬†17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2014:093:TOC).\n\n(¬†[66](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0066)¬†)¬†[OJ 1996 L¬†31, p.¬†2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1996:031:TOC).\n\n(¬†[67](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0067)¬†) The three regulations at issue all have Regulation No¬†19/65 as their legal basis.\n\n(¬†[68](#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0068)¬†) See Article¬†4(1)(a) of Regulation No¬†316/2014.

The Belgian courts, including the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen (Court of Appeal, Antwerp, Belgium), had dismissed as inadmissible similar actions brought before them on the ground that the bill of lading, drawn up on 13¬†August 2006, the date on which Samskip took delivery of the installation in Antwerp (Belgium), contained a contractual clause (‚Äòjurisdiction clause‚Äô) stating that any dispute arising thereunder was to be decided by Icelandic courts according to Icelandic law.\n\nLegal context\n\nInternational law\n\n4\n\nThe Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed on 30¬†October 2007 and approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2009/430/EC of 27¬†November 2008 ([OJ 2009 L¬†147, p.¬†1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2009:147:TOC)) (‚Äòthe Lugano Convention‚Äô), states in Article¬†23(1), the wording of which is largely similar to that of Article¬†17 of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, done at Lugano on 16¬†September 1988 ([OJ 1988 L¬†319, p.¬†9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1988:319:TOC)), which it replaced:\n\n‚ÄòIf the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a State bound by this Convention, have agreed that a court or the courts of a State bound by this Convention are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing, or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves, or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.‚Äô\n\nEuropean Union law\n\n5\n\nRecitals¬†2, 6 and¬†15 to¬†17 in the preamble to Regulation No¬†44/2001 read as follows:\n\n‚Äò(2)\n\nCertain differences between national rules governing jurisdiction and recognition of judgments hamper the sound operation of the internal market. Provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to simplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from Member States bound by this Regulation are essential.\n\n...\n\n(6)\n\nIn order to attain the objective of free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, it is necessary and appropriate that the rules governing jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments be governed by a Community legal instrument which is binding and directly applicable.\n\n...\n\n(15)\n\nIn the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. There must be a clear and effective mechanism for resolving cases of¬†lis pendens¬†and related actions and for obviating problems flowing from national differences as to the determination of the time when a case is regarded as pending. For the purposes of this Regulation that time should be defined autonomously.\n\n(16)\n\nMutual trust in the administration of justice in the Community justifies judgments given in a Member State being recognised automatically without the need for any procedure except in cases of dispute.\n\n(17)\n\nBy virtue of the same principle of mutual trust, the procedure for making enforceable in one Member State a judgment given in another must be efficient and rapid. To that end, the declaration that a judgment is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion any of the grounds for non-enforcement provided for by this Regulation.‚Äô\n\n6\n\nUnder Article¬†23(1) of that regulation, the wording of which is in essence identical to that of Article¬†23(1) of the Lugano Convention, referred to in paragraph¬†4 above:\n\n‚ÄòIf the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n\n(a)\n\nin writing or evidenced in writing, or\n\n(b)\n\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves, or\n\n(c)\n\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.‚Äô\n\n7\n\nArticle¬†32 of the same regulation provides:\n\n‚ÄòFor the purposes of this Regulation, ‚Äújudgment‚Äù means any judgment given by a court or tribunal of a Member State, whatever the judgment may be called, including a decree, order, decision or writ of execution, as well as the determination of costs or expenses by an officer of the court.‚Äô\n\n8\n\nArticle¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†A judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†Any interested party who raises the recognition of a judgment as the principal issue in a dispute may, in accordance with the procedures provided for in sections¬†2 and¬†3 of this Chapter, apply for a decision that the judgment be recognised.\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†If the outcome of proceedings in a court of a Member State depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.‚Äô\n\n9\n\nAccording to Article¬†34 of that regulation:\n\n‚ÄòA judgment shall not be recognised:\n\n1.\n\nif such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n\n2.\n\nwhere it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so;\n\n3.\n\nif it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n\n4.\n\nif it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State addressed.‚Äô\n\n10\n\nArticle¬†35 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†Moreover, a judgment shall not be recognised if it conflicts with sections¬†3, 4 or¬†6 of Chapter¬†II, or in a case provided for in Article¬†72.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†In its examination of the grounds of jurisdiction referred to in the foregoing paragraph, the court or authority applied to shall be bound by the findings of fact on which the court of the Member State of origin based its jurisdiction.\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†Subject to the paragraph¬†1, the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin may not be reviewed. The test of public policy referred to in point¬†1 of Article¬†34¬†may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction.‚Äô\n\n11\n\nUnder Article¬†36 of Regulation No¬†44/2001:\n\n‚ÄòUnder no circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.‚Äô\n\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\n12\n\nIn 2006, Krones sold a brewing installation to the recipient. It charged Samskip with the task of organising and providing the transport of that installation from Antwerp to Guadalajara (Mexico), via Altamira, another city in Mexico.\n\n13\n\nThe consignment, which consisted of containers and transport frames, was delivered to Samskip on 13¬†August¬†2006. On that same day Samskip drew up the bill of lading designating Krones as the shipper, the recipient as the consignee, Antwerp as the port of loading and Altamira as the port of destination. Point¬†2 of the terms and conditions (‚ÄòEndorsements‚Äô) set out on the reverse side of that document stipulates:\n\n‚ÄòJurisdiction. Any dispute arising under this Bill of Lading to be decided in Iceland according to Icelandic law.‚Äô\n\n14\n\nThe applicants in the main proceedings claim that the consignment was damaged during the transport by sea and that part of it was also damaged during the transport by land from Altamira to Guadalajara. Krones assigned its claims in respect of the maximum insurable amount of two special drawing rights (valued at the time of assignment at EUR¬†235¬†666.46) to the insurers in proportion to their percentage share of the risk. The recipient likewise assigned its claims under the bill of lading to the insurers in proportion to their percentage share of the risk.\n\n15\n\nThe recipient and the insurers brought the matter before the Belgian courts by an action lodged on 30¬†August 2007 and requested that Samskip appear before the Rechtbank van koophandel te Antwerpen (Antwerp Commercial Court) on 16¬†October 2007. That court ruled in favour of the insurers and the recipient, but the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen revised that judgment by its judgment of 5¬†October 2009, by which it declared itself ‚Äòto have no authority to hear and decide the case‚Äô.\n\n16\n\nIn its reasons for judgment, the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen held that the recipient was not entitled to bring proceedings on the basis of the contract of carriage. The insurers did have the right to institute proceedings as successors in title to Krones, but they were bound by the jurisdiction clause contained in the bill of lading. Under point¬†2 of the clauses therein, the Icelandic courts have exclusive jurisdiction, and for that reason the Belgian courts have no authority to hear and decide the case. That judgment has become final.\n\n17\n\nIn September 2010, the insurers brought an action for compensation against Samskip before the Landgericht Bremen (Regional Court, Bremen), whilst Krones brought an action for compensation against Samskip before the Landgericht Landshut (Regional Court, Landshut). That court referred the latter proceedings to the referring court by order of 3¬†June 2011.\n\n18\n\nThe Landgericht Bremen observes that, in Samskip‚Äôs submission, the actions are inadmissible inasmuch as the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5¬†October 2009 produces legal effects not only as regards the Belgian courts‚Äô lack of jurisdiction but also as regards the finding that jurisdiction lies with the Icelandic courts, as stated in the grounds of that judgment. Samskip states that that judgment has binding effect on the referring court in accordance with Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001.\n\n19\n\nThe insurers and Krones argue that, at most, binding effect extends to that part of the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5¬†October 2009 which finds that the Belgian courts have no jurisdiction. The effect of that judgment extends no further, however, and certainly not so far as to mean that, as a result of the asserted jurisdiction of the Icelandic courts, courts of Member States other than the Kingdom of Belgium have no jurisdiction.\n\n20\n\nThe referring court, citing German legal doctrine, observes that the judgment of the Hof van beroep te Antwerpen of 5¬†October 2009 is a ‚Äòjudgment on a procedural matter‚Äô (‚ÄòProzessurteil‚Äô) which dismisses the action as inadmissible by reason of its failure to satisfy the requirements for a judgment on the merits of the case. Such judgments given by foreign courts are for the most part not regarded as being capable of recognition under German law. It therefore wonders whether it is bound to recognise that judgment and, if so, whether the scope of such recognition extends to the reasons for judgment contained therein as well.\n\n21\n\nIn those circumstances, the Landgericht Bremen decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚Äò1.\n\nAre Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that the term ‚Äújudgment‚Äù also covers in principle those judgments which are restricted to the finding that the procedural requirements for admissibility are not satisfied (so-called ‚Äúprocedural judgments‚Äù)?\n\n2.\n\nAre Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that the term ‚Äújudgment‚Äù also covers a judgment ending proceedings by which a court declines international jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause?\n\n3.\n\nHaving regard to the case‚Äëlaw of the Court of Justice on the principle of extended effect (Case¬†[145/86¬†Hoffmann¬†[1988] ECR 645](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=61986??0145\u0026locale=EN)), are Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that each Member State is required to recognise the judgments of a court of another Member State on the effectiveness of a jurisdiction clause agreed on by the parties, where the finding as to the effectiveness of the jurisdiction clause has become final under the national law of that court ‚Äì even where the decision on the point forms part of a procedural judgment dismissing the action?‚Äô\n\nThe question referred for a preliminary ruling\n\nThe first and second questions\n\n22\n\nBy its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article¬†32 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, even though that judgment is classified as a ‚Äòprocedural judgment‚Äô by the law of another Member State.\n\n23\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that, in accordance with the wording of Article¬†32 of Regulation No¬†44/2001, the concept of ‚Äòjudgment‚Äô covers ‚Äòany‚Äô judgment given by a court of a Member State, without any distinction being drawn according to the content of the judgment in question, which means that, in principle, that concept also comprises a judgment by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause.\n\n24\n\nThe Court has held that Article¬†25 of the Convention of 27¬†September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ([OJ 1972 L¬†299, p.¬†32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1972:299:TOC)), the Court‚Äôs interpretation of which also holds true, in principle, for the corresponding provision of Regulation No¬†44/2001 (see, to that effect, Case¬†[C-406/09¬†Realchemie Nederland¬†[2011] ECR I-9773](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62009C?0406\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†38), namely Article¬†32 of that regulation, is not limited to decisions which terminate a dispute in whole or in part, but also applies to provisional or interlocutory decisions (Case¬†[C-39/02¬†M√¶rsk Olie \u0026 Gas¬†[2004] ECR I-9657](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62002C?0039\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†46).\n\n25\n\nMoreover, according to the Court‚Äôs settled case‚Äëlaw, the provisions of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted independently, by reference to its scheme and purpose (see, to that effect, Case¬†[C-103/05¬†Reisch Montage¬†[2006] ECR I-6827](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62005C?0103\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†29; Case¬†[C-167/08¬†Draka NK Cables and Others¬†[2009] ECR I-3477](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62008C?0167\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†19; and Case¬†[C-189/08¬†Zuid-Chemie¬†[2009] ECR I-6917](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62008C?0189\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†17).\n\n26\n\nOne of the objectives of Regulation No¬†44/2001, as evidenced by recital¬†2 in the preamble thereto, is to ‚Äòsimplify the formalities with a view to rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments from [the] Member States‚Äô bound by that regulation, which also tends to support an interpretation of the concept of ‚Äòjudgment‚Äô which does not take into account the categorisation under a Member State‚Äôs law of a decision by a court of that Member State, be it the law of the Member State of origin or that of the Member State in which recognition is sought. An interpretation of that concept based on the particularities of each national legal order would give rise to considerable obstacles in the achievement of that objective.\n\n27\n\nMoreover, recital¬†6 in the preamble to Regulation No¬†44/2001 refers to ‚Äòthe objective of free movement of judgments in civil and commercial matters‚Äô. That objective supports the position that the concept of ‚Äòjudgment‚Äô for the purposes of Article¬†32 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as encompassing judgments by which a court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause. A failure to recognise such judgments could seriously undermine the free movement of judgments.\n\n28\n\nAs regards the system introduced by Regulation No¬†44/2001, recitals¬†16 and¬†17 in the preamble thereto underline the importance of the principle of mutual trust between the courts of the Member States in the recognition and enforcement of judgments, which also implies that that concept is not to be interpreted restrictively, in order to avoid, inter alia, disputes as to what constitutes a ‚Äòjudgment‚Äô.\n\n29\n\nThat mutual trust would be undermined if a court of a Member State could refuse to recognise a judgment by which a court of another Member State declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause. To allow a court of a Member State to refuse to recognise such a judgment would run counter to the system introduced by Regulation No¬†44/2001, because such a refusal would be liable to compromise the effective operation of the rules set out in Chapter¬†II of that regulation on the distribution of jurisdiction as between the courts of the Member States.\n\n30\n\nAs observed by the Advocate General in points¬†49 and¬†50 of his Opinion, Articles¬†33 to¬†35 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 also militate against a restrictive interpretation of the concept of ‚Äòjudgment‚Äô for the purposes of Article¬†32 thereof. Article¬†33 sets out the principle that judgments are to be recognised, whilst Articles¬†34 and¬†35 provide for exceptions to that principle, which must be interpreted restrictively. Moreover, Article¬†35(3) provides that the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin may not be reviewed and that the test of public policy may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction.\n\n31\n\nA restrictive interpretation of the concept of judgment would give rise to a category of judicial decisions which are not among the exhaustively-listed exceptions set out in Articles¬†34 and¬†35 of Regulation No¬†44/2001, which could not be categorised as ‚Äòjudgments‚Äô for the purposes of Article¬†32 and which the courts of other Member States would accordingly not be obliged to recognise. It is clear that such a category of decisions, including in particular those by which a court in another Member State declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, would be incompatible with the system established by Articles¬†33 to¬†35 of Regulation No¬†44/2001, which favours the unimpeded recognition of judgments and rules out the possibility of review of the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin by the courts of the Member State in which recognition is sought.\n\n32\n\nIn the light of all the considerations set out above, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article¬†32 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which the court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, irrespective of how that judgment is categorised under the law of another Member State.\n\nThe third question\n\n33\n\nBy its third question the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding ‚Äì made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible ‚Äì regarding the validity of that clause.\n\n34\n\nAs the Court has observed, referring to the Report of 27¬†September 1968 on the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, drawn up by Mr¬†Jenard ([OJ 1979 C¬†59, p.¬†1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:C:1979:059:TOC)), recognition must ‚Äòhave the result of conferring on judgments the authority and effectiveness accorded to them in the State in which they were given‚Äô (Hoffmann, paragraph¬†10). Accordingly, a foreign judgment which has been recognised under Article¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must in principle have the same effects in the State in which recognition is sought as it does in the State of origin (see, to that effect,¬†Hoffmann, paragraph¬†11).\n\n35\n\nMoreover, as observed in paragraph¬†28 above, the principle of mutual trust between courts underlies the system established by Regulation No¬†44/2001. As observed by the Advocate General in point¬†73 of his Opinion, a high degree of mutual trust is all the more necessary where the courts of the Member States are called on to apply common rules of direct jurisdiction. Thus, those rules and the rules on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in that regulation do not constitute distinct and autonomous systems but are closely linked (Case¬†[C-514/10¬†Wolf Naturprodukte¬†[2012] ECR, paragraph¬†25). It is on that link that rests the simplified mechanism of recognition and enforcement set out in Article¬†33(1) of that regulation, under which a judgment given in a Member State is in principle to be recognised in the other Member States and which leads, pursuant to Article¬†35(3) of that regulation, to there being no review of the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State of origin (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/03 [2006] ECR I-1145](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62010C?0514\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†163).\n\n36\n\nArticle¬†23 of Regulation No¬†44/2001, relating to contractual agreements as to jurisdiction, does not apply in the main proceedings because the jurisdiction clause at issue here confers jurisdiction on the courts in the Republic of Iceland, which is not a Member State. However, as observed by the Advocate General in point¬†76 of his Opinion, the Lugano Convention, to which the Republic of Iceland is a party, contains in Article¬†23 a provision corresponding to Article¬†23 of that regulation. If a court of the Member State of origin, in the assessment of its own jurisdiction, has held such a jurisdiction clause to be valid, it would in principle be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between the courts of the European Union to allow a court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to review that very same issue of validity.\n\n37\n\nIt is, moreover, apparent from Article¬†36 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 that, in accordance with the principle of mutual trust, the judgment of the court of the Member State of origin may ‚Äò[u]nder no circumstances ‚Ä¶ be reviewed as to its substance‚Äô. It is stated on page 46 of the report drawn up by Mr¬†Jenard that ‚Äò[t]he absence of any review of the substance of the case implies complete confidence in the court of the State in which judgment was given; it is similarly to be assumed that that court correctly applied the [harmonised] rules of jurisdiction‚Äô.\n\n38\n\nTo allow a court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to disregard, as devoid of effect, the jurisdiction clause which a court of the Member State of origin has held to be valid would run counter to that prohibition of a review as to the merits, particularly in circumstances where the latter might well have ruled, but for that clause, that it had jurisdiction. In the latter situation, such a finding on the part of the court of the Member State in which recognition is sought would call into question not only the intermediate finding made by the court of the Member State of origin as to the validity of the jurisdiction clause, but also the very decision of that court to decline its own jurisdiction.\n\n39\n\nAs observed by the Advocate General in point¬†82 of his Opinion, the exclusion of review of the jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin implies, as a correlation, a restriction of the power of the court of the Member State in which recognition is sought to ascertain its own jurisdiction because the latter is bound by what was decided by the court of the Member State of origin. The requirement of the uniform application of European Union law means that the specific scope of that restriction must be defined at European Union level rather than vary according to different national rules on¬†res judicata.\n\n40\n\nMoreover, the concept of¬†res judicata¬†under European Union law does not attach only to the operative part of the judgment in question, but also attaches to the¬†ratio decidendi¬†of that judgment, which provides the necessary underpinning for the operative part and is inseparable from it (see, inter alia, Joined Cases¬†[C-442/03¬†P and¬†C-471/03¬†P¬†P¬†\u0026¬†O European Ferries (Vizcaya) and Diputaci√≥n Foral de Vizcaya¬†v¬†Commission¬†[2006] ECR I-4845](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62003C?0442\u0026locale=EN), paragraph¬†44, and Case C‚Äë221/10¬†P¬†Artegodan¬†v¬†Commission¬†[2012] ECR, paragraph¬†87). As observed in paragraph¬†35 above, given that the common rules of jurisdiction applied by the courts of the Member States have their source in European Union law, more specifically in Regulation No¬†44/2001, and given the requirement of uniform application referred to in paragraph¬†39 above, the concept of¬†res judicata¬†under European Union law is relevant for determining the effects produced by a judgment by which a court of a Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause.\n\n41\n\nThus, a judgment by which a court of a Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, on the ground that that clause is valid, binds the courts of the other Member States both as regards that court‚Äôs decision to decline jurisdiction, contained in the operative part of the judgment, and as regards the finding on the validity of that clause, contained in the¬†ratio decidendi¬†which provides the necessary underpinning for that operative part.\n\n42\n\nThis approach is not called into question by the argument put forward by the Federal Republic of Germany, based inter alia on paragraph¬†66 of the judgment in Case¬†[C-420/07¬†Apostolides¬†[2009] ECR I-3571](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/query.html?DN=62007C?0420\u0026locale=EN), according to which there is no reason for granting to a judgment, when it is enforced, rights which it does not have in the Member States in question. The recognition of judgments, handed down by courts of Member States, declining jurisdiction under Regulation No¬†44/2001 which are delivered ‚Äì as observed in paragraph¬†35 above ‚Äì pursuant to common rules of jurisdiction provided for by European Union law, is governed by its own¬†sui generis¬†system, as described in paragraphs¬†39 to¬†41 above.\n\n43\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the answer to third question is that Articles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding ‚Äì made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible ‚Äì regarding the validity of that clause.\n\nCosts\n\n44\n\nSince these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\n¬†\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n¬†\n\n1.\n\nArticle¬†32 of Council Regulation (EC) No¬†44/2001 of 22¬†December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that it also covers a judgment by which the court of a Member State declines jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause, irrespective of how that judgment is categorised under the law of another Member State.\n\n¬†\n\n2.\n\nArticles¬†32 and¬†33 of Regulation No¬†44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that the court before which recognition is sought of a judgment by which a court of another Member State has declined jurisdiction on the basis of a jurisdiction clause is bound by the finding ‚Äì made in the grounds of a judgment, which has since become final, declaring the action inadmissible ‚Äì regarding the validity of that clause.\n\n¬†\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n(¬†[*1](#c-ECR_62011CJ0456_EN_01-E0001)¬†) Language of the case: German.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.115670017Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Ingmar":{"title":"","content":"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)\n\n9 November 2000 (1)\n\n(Directive 86/653/EEC - Self-employed commercial agent carrying on his activity in a Member State - Principal established in a non-member country - Clause submitting the agency contract to the law of the country of establishment of the principal)\n\nIn Case C-381/98,\n\nREFERENCE to the Court under Article 177 of the EC Treaty (now Article 234 EC) by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division), United Kingdom, for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between\n\nIngmar GB Ltd\n\nand\n\nEaton Leonard Technologies Inc.\n\non the interpretation of Council Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents (OJ 1986 L 382, p. 17),\n\nTHE COURT (Fifth Chamber),\n\ncomposed of: M.

('Eaton‚Äò), a company established in California, concerning the payment of sums claimed to be due on account, in particular, of the termination of an agency contract.\nLegal framework\n\nCommunity legislation\n\n3.\n    In the second recital in its preamble it is stated that the Directive was adopted in the light of the fact that 'the differences in national laws concerning commercial representation substantially affect the conditions of competition and the carrying-on of that activity within the Community and are detrimental both to the protection available to commercial agents vis-√†-vis their principals and to the security of commercial transactions‚Äò.\n4.\n    Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive specify the circumstances in which the commercial agent is entitled, on termination of the contract, to an indemnity or to compensation for the damage he suffers as a result of the termination of his relations with the principal.\n5.\n    Article 17(1) of the Directive provides:\n'[M]ember States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the commercial agent is, after termination of the agency contract, indemnified in accordance with paragraph 2 or compensated for damage in accordance with paragraph 3.‚Äò\n\n6.\n    Article 19 of the Directive provides:\n'[T]he parties may not derogate from Articles 17 and 18 to the detriment of the commercial agent before the agency contract expires.‚Äò\n\n7.\n    Under Article 22(1) and (3) thereof, the Directive was to be implemented before 1 January 1990 and, with regard to the United Kingdom, before 1 January 1994. Under Article 22(1), the national provisions implementing the Directive must apply at least to contracts concluded after their entry into force and, in any event, to contracts in operation by 1 January 1994 at the latest.\nNational legislation\n\n8.\n    In the United Kingdom, the Directive was implemented by the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations 1993, which entered into force on 1 January 1994 ('the Regulations‚Äò).\n9.\n    Regulation 1(2) and (3) provides:\n'2.    These Regulations govern the relations between commercial agents and their principals and, subject to paragraph 3, apply in relation to the activities of commercial agents in Great Britain.\n\n3.    Regulations 3 to 22 do not apply where the parties have agreed that the agency contract is to be governed by the law of another Member State.‚Äò\n\nThe main proceedings\n\n10.\n    In 1989, Ingmar and Eaton concluded a contract under which Ingmar was appointed as Eaton's commercial agent in the United Kingdom. A clause of the contract stipulated that the contract was governed by the law of the State of California.\n11.\n    The contract was terminated in 1996. Ingmar instituted proceedings before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, seeking payment of commission and, pursuant to Regulation 17, compensation for damage suffered as a result of the termination of its relations with Eaton.\n12.\n    By judgment of 23 October 1997, the High Court held that the Regulations did not apply, since the contract was governed by the law of the State of California.\n13.\n    Ingmar appealed against that judgment to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division), which decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n'Under English law, effect will be given to the applicable law as chosen by the parties, unless there is a public policy reason, such as an overriding provision, for not so doing. In such circumstances, are the provisions of Council Directive 86/653/EEC, as implemented in the laws of the Member States, and in particular those provisions relating to the payment of compensation to agents on termination of their agreements with their principals, applicable when:\n\n(a)    a principal appoints an exclusive agent in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for the sale of its products therein; and\n\n(b)    in so far as sales of the products in the United Kingdom are concerned, the agent carries out its activities in the United Kingdom; and\n\n(c)    the principal is a company incorporated in a non-EU State, and in particular in the State of California, USA, and situated there; and\n\n(d)    the express applicable law of the contract between the parties is that of the State of California, USA?‚Äò\n\nThe question referred for preliminary ruling\n\n14.\n    By its question, the national court seeks to ascertain, essentially, whether Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-member country and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\n15.\n    The parties to the main proceedings, the United Kingdom and German Governments and the Commission agree that the freedom of contracting parties to choose the system of law by which they wish their contractual relations to be governed is a basic tenet of private international law and that that freedom is removed only by rules that are mandatory.\n16.\n    However, their submissions differ as to the conditions which a legal rule must satisfy in order to be classified as a mandatory rule for the purposes of private international law.\n17.\n    Eaton contends that such mandatory rules can arise only in extremely limited circumstances and that, in the present case, there is no reason to apply the Directive, which is intended to harmonise the domestic laws of the Member States, to parties established outside the European Union.\n18.\n    Ingmar, the United Kingdom Government and the Commission submit that the question of the territorial scope of the Directive is a question of Community law. In their submission, the objectives pursued by the Directive require that its provisions be applied to all commercial agents established in a Member State, irrespective of the nationality or the place of establishment of their principal.\n19.\n    According to the German Government, in the absence of any express provision in the Directive as regards its territorial scope, it is for the court of a Member State seised of a dispute concerning a commercial agent's entitlement to indemnity or compensation to examine the question whether the applicable national rules are to be regarded as mandatory rules for the purposes of private international law.\n20.\n    In that respect, it should be borne in mind, first, that the Directive is designed to protect commercial agents, as defined in the Directive (Case C-215/97 Bellone v Yokohama [1998] ECR I-2191, paragraph 13).\n21.\n    The purpose of Articles 17 to 19 of the Directive, in particular, is to protect the commercial agent after termination of the contract. The regime established by the Directive for that purpose is mandatory in nature. Article 17 requires Member States to put in place a mechanism for providing reparation to the commercial agent after termination of the contract. Admittedly, that article allows the Member States to choose between indemnification and compensation for damage. However, Articles 17 and 18 prescribe a precise framework within which the Member States may exercise their discretion as to the choice of methods for calculating the indemnity or compensation to be granted.\n22.\n    The mandatory nature of those articles is confirmed by the fact that, under Article 19 of the Directive, the parties may not derogate from them to the detriment of the commercial agent before the contract expires. It is also borne out by the fact that, with regard to the United Kingdom, Article 22 of the Directive provides for the immediate application of the national provisions implementing the Directive to contracts in operation.\n23.\n    Second, it should be borne in mind that, as is apparent from the second recital in the preamble to the Directive, the harmonising measures laid down by the Directive are intended, inter alia, to eliminate restrictions on the carrying-on of the activities of commercial agents, to make the conditions of competition within the Community uniform and to increase the security of commercial transactions (see, to that effect, Bellone, paragraph 17).\n24.\n    The purpose of the regime established in Articles 17 to 19 of the Directive is thus to protect, for all commercial agents, freedom of establishment and the operation of undistorted competition in the internal market. Those provisions must therefore be observed throughout the Community if those Treaty objectives are to be attained.\n25.\n    It must therefore be held that it is essential for the Community legal order that a principal established in a non-member country, whose commercial agent carries on his activity within the Community, cannot evade those provisions by the simple expedient of a choice-of-law clause. The purpose served by the provisions in question requires that they be applied where the situation is closely connected with the Community, in particular where the commercial agent carries on his activity in the territory of a Member State, irrespective of the law by which the parties intended the contract to be governed.\n26.\n    In the light of those considerations, the answer to the question must be that Articles 17 and 18 of the Directive, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-membercountry and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\nCosts\n\n27.\n    The costs incurred by the United Kingdom and German Governments and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.\nOn those grounds,\n\nTHE COURT (Fifth Chamber),\n\nin answer to the question referred to it by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division) by order of 31 July 1998, hereby rules:\n\nArticles 17 and 18 of Council Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents, which guarantee certain rights to commercial agents after termination of agency contracts, must be applied where the commercial agent carried on his activity in a Member State although the principal is established in a non-member country and a clause of the contract stipulates that the contract is to be governed by the law of that country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWathelet\nEdward\nJann\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 November 2000.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.115670017Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Montaza-Claro":{"title":"","content":"**Case C-168/05**\n\n**Elisa Mar√≠a Mostaza Claro**\n\n**v**\n\n**Centro M√≥vil Milenium SL**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the\n\nAudiencia Provincial de Madrid)\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC ‚Äì Unfair terms in consumer contracts ‚Äì Failure to raise the unfair nature of a term during arbitration proceedings ‚Äì Possibility of raising that objection in the context of an action brought against the arbitration award)\n\nSummary of the Judgment\n\n_Approximation of laws ‚Äì Unfair terms in consumer contracts ‚Äì Directive 93/13_\n\n_(Council Directive 93/13, Arts 3(1)(t) and 6(1))_\n\nDirective 93/13, concerning unfair terms in consumer contracts, must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n(see para. 39, operative part)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (First Chamber)\n\n26 October 2006¬†([*](#Footnote*))\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC ‚Äì Unfair terms in consumer contracts ‚Äì Failure to raise the unfair nature of a term during arbitration proceedings ‚Äì Possibility of raising that objection in the context of an action brought against the arbitration award)\n\nIn Case C-168/05,\n\nREFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC from the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Spain), made by decision of 15 February 2005, received at the Court on 14 April 2005, in the proceedings\n\n**Elisa Mar√≠a Mostaza Claro**\n\nv\n\n**Centro M√≥vil Milenium SL**,\n\nTHE COURT (First Chamber),\n\ncomposed of P.¬†Jann, President of the Chamber, K.¬†Lenaerts, E.¬†Juh√°sz, J.N.

In any event, the terms listed in the first additional provision to this Law shall be regarded as unfair. ‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n11¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The first additional provision to Law 26/1984 essentially reproduces the list of terms capable of being regarded as unfair which is annexed to the Directive, stating that that list is merely minimal in nature. According to point 26 of that additional provision, ‚Äòsubmission to arbitration other than consumer arbitration, except in the case of arbitration bodies established by statutory provision in respect of a specific sector or circumstances‚Äô is to be regarded as unfair.\n\n12¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article 8 of Law 7/1998 provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†General conditions which infringe the provisions of this Law or any other rule ordering or prohibiting certain conduct, to the detriment of a party to the contract, shall automatically be void, save in so far as they make separate provision for cases of breach.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In particular, general terms which are unfair, where the contract has been concluded with a consumer as defined in any event in Article 10a and the first additional provision of Law 26/1984 ‚Ä¶ shall be void.‚Äô\n\n13¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At the time of the facts in the main proceedings, arbitration proceedings were governed by Ley 36/1988 de Arbitraje, of 5 December 1988, BOE No¬†293 of 7 December 1988 (Law 36/1998 on arbitration) (‚ÄòLaw 36/1988‚Äô).\n\n14¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article 23(1) of Law 36/1988 provided:\n\n‚ÄòAn objection to arbitration on the ground that the arbitrators lack objective jurisdiction or on the grounds of the non-existence, nullity or expiry of the arbitration agreement must be raised at the same time as the parties make their initial submissions.‚Äô\n\n15¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article 45 of Law 36/1988 was worded as follows:\n\n‚ÄòThe arbitration award may be annulled only in the following cases:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Where the arbitration agreement is null and void.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Where the award is contrary to public policy.‚Äô\n\n¬†**The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred to the Court**\n\n16¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On 2 May 2002, a mobile telephone contract was concluded between M√≥vil and Ms¬†Mostaza Claro. The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any disputes arising from the contract were to be referred for arbitration to the Asociaci√≥n Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity) (AEADE).\n\n17¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As Ms¬†Mostaza Claro did not comply with the minimum subscription period, M√≥vil initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE. By letter of 25 July 2003, the latter granted Ms¬†Mostaza Claro a period of 10 days in which to refuse arbitration proceedings, stating that, in the event of refusal, she could bring legal proceedings. Ms¬†Mostaza Claro presented arguments on the merits of the dispute, but did not repudiate the arbitration proceedings or claim that the arbitration agreement was void. The arbitration proceedings subsequently took place and the arbitrator found against her.\n\n18¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Ms¬†Mostaza Claro contested the arbitration decision delivered by the AEADE before the referring court, submitting that the unfair nature of the arbitration clause meant that the arbitration agreement was null and void.\n\n19¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the order for reference, the Audiencia Provincial (Provincial Court) de Madrid (Spain) states that there is no doubt that the arbitration agreement includes an unfair contractual term and is therefore null and void.\n\n20¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, as Ms¬†Mostaza Claro did not plead that the agreement was invalid in the context of the arbitration proceedings, and in order to interpret the national law in accordance with the Directive, the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚ÄòMay the protection of consumers under Council Directive 93/13/EEC ‚Ä¶ require the court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award to determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and to annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the consumer‚Äôs detriment, when that issue is raised in the action for annulment but was not raised by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings?‚Äô\n\n¬†**Preliminary observations**\n\n21¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is apparent from the documents sent to the Court by the Audiencia Provincial that the latter has established that the arbitration clause contained in the contract concluded between M√≥vil and Ms¬†Mostaza Claro was unfair.\n\n22¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In that respect, it must be recalled that the Court may not rule on the application of general criteria used by the Community legislature in order to define the concept of unfair term to a particular term, which must be considered in the light of the particular circumstances of the case in question (Case C-237/02¬†_Freiburger Kommunalbauten_¬†[2004] ECR¬†I-3403, paragraph 22).\n\n23¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is therefore for the national court to decide whether a contractual term such as that at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of the Directive (_Freiburger Kommunalbauten_, paragraph 25).\n\n¬†**The question referred**\n\n24¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to settled case-law, in the absence of relevant Community rules, the detailed procedural rules designed to ensure the protection of the rights which individuals acquire under Community law are a matter for the domestic legal order of each Member State, under the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States, provided that they are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by the Community legal order (principle of effectiveness) (see, inter alia, Case C‚Äë78/98¬†_Preston and Others_¬†[2000] ECR I-3201, paragraph 31, and Joined Cases C-392/04 and C-422/04¬†_i-21 Germany and__Arcor_¬†[2006] ECR I-0000, paragraph 57).\n\n25¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The system of protection introduced by the Directive is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-√†-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge. This leads to the consumer agreeing to terms drawn up in advance by the seller or supplier without being able to influence the content of those terms (Joined Cases C-240/98 to C-244/98¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo__Editorial and Salvat Editores_¬†[2000] ECR¬†I-4941, paragraph 25).\n\n26¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Such an imbalance between the consumer and the seller or supplier may only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract (_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 27).\n\n27¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is on the basis of those principles that the Court has ruled that the national court‚Äôs power to determine of its own motion whether a term is unfair constitutes a means both of achieving the result sought by Article 6 of the Directive, namely preventing an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term, and of contributing to achieving the aim of Article 7, since if the court undertakes such an examination, that may act as a deterrent and contribute to preventing unfair terms in contracts concluded between consumers and sellers or suppliers (_Oc√©ano Grupo__Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 28, and Case C-473/00¬†_Cofidis_¬†[2002] ECR¬†I-10875, paragraph 32).\n\n28¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†That power of the national court has been regarded as necessary for ensuring that the consumer enjoys effective protection, in view in particular of the real risk that he is unaware of his rights or encounters difficulties in enforcing them (_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores_, paragraph 26, and¬†_Cofidis_, paragraph 33).\n\n29¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The protection which the Directive confers on consumers thus extends to cases in which a consumer who has concluded with a seller or supplier a contract containing an unfair term fails to raise the unfair nature of the term, whether because he is unaware of his rights or because he is deterred from enforcing them on account of the costs which judicial proceedings would involve (_Cofidis_, paragraph 34).\n\n30¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Under those circumstances, the result sought by Article 6 of the Directive which, as was recalled at paragraph 27 of this judgment, requires the Member States to ensure that consumers are not bound by unfair terms, could not be achieved if the court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award was unable to determine whether that award was void solely because the consumer did not plead the invalidity of the arbitration agreement in the course of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n31¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Such an omission by the consumer could not then, under any circumstances, be compensated for by action on the part of persons not party to the contract. The regime of special protection established by the Directive would be definitively undermined.\n\n32¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is precisely the direction that has been taken by the Spanish legislation. Although not applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings, it is worth pointing out that Ley 60/2003 de Arbitraje, of 23 December 2003, BOE No¬†309 of 26 December 2003 (Law 60/2003 on Arbitration), no longer requires an objection to the arbitration, in particular on the grounds of the invalidity of the arbitration agreement, to be raised at the same time as the parties make their original claims.\n\n33¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†M√≥vil and the German Government submit that, if the national court were allowed to determine whether an arbitration agreement is void where the consumer did not raise such an objection during the arbitration proceedings, this would seriously undermine the effectiveness of arbitration awards.\n\n34¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It follows from that argument that it is in the interest of efficient arbitration proceedings that review of arbitration awards should be limited in scope and that annulment of or refusal to recognise an award should be possible only in exceptional circumstances (Case C‚Äë126/97¬†_Eco Swiss_¬†[1999] ECR¬†I-3055, paragraph 35).\n\n35¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, the Court has already ruled that, where its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with Community rules of this type (see, to that effect,¬†_Eco Swiss_, paragraph 37).\n\n36¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The importance of consumer protection has in particular led the Community legislature to lay down, in Article 6(1) of the Directive, that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier ‚Äòshall ‚Ä¶ not be binding on the consumer‚Äô. This is a mandatory provision which, taking into account the weaker position of one of the parties to the contract, aims to replace the formal balance which the latter establishes between the rights and obligations of the parties with an effective balance which re-establishes equality between them.\n\n37¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Moreover, as the aim of the Directive is to strengthen consumer protection, it constitutes, according to Article 3(1)(t) EC, a measure which is essential to the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, to raising the standard of living and the quality of life in its territory (see, by analogy, concerning Article 81 EC,¬†_Eco Swiss_, paragraph 36).\n\n38¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The nature and importance of the public interest underlying the protection which the Directive confers on consumers justify, moreover, the national court being required to assess of its own motion whether a contractual term is unfair, compensating in this way for the imbalance which exists between the consumer and the seller or supplier.\n\n39¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the question referred must be that the Directive must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.\n\n¬†**Costs**\n\n40¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n**Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](#Footref*)¬†Language of the case: Spanish.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.115670017Z","tags":null},"/setup/Cases/Montaza-Claro-AG":{"title":"","content":"OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL\n\nTIZZANO\n\ndelivered on 27 April 2006¬†1([1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote1))\n\n**Case C-168/05**\n\n**Elisa Mar√≠a Mostaza Claro**\n\n**v**\n\n**Centro M√≥vil Milenium SL**\n\n(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Spain))\n\n(Directive 93/13/EEC ‚Äì Consumer contracts ‚Äì Arbitration clause ‚Äì Unfairness ‚Äì Unlawfulness ‚Äì Issue not raised in arbitration proceedings ‚Äì Possibility of raising the issue in an action for annulment of the award)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†By order of 15 February 2005, the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid (Provincial Court, Madrid, hereinafter ‚ÄòAudiencia Provincial‚Äô) referred a question to the Court under Article¬†234¬†EC for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5¬†April 1993, on unfair terms in consumer contracts (hereinafter ‚ÄòDirective 93/13‚Äô or simply ‚Äòthe Directive‚Äô).¬†([2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote2))\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In particular, the Audiencia Provincial seeks to ascertain whether the system of consumer protection established by the Directive requires that a national court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine of its own motion the illegality of an arbitration clause which has been found to be unfair, even if the plea to that effect was not raised in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time by the consumer in the application for annulment.\n\nI¬†‚Äì¬†¬†**Legal framework**\n\nA¬†‚Äì¬†¬†¬†¬†_Community law_\n\nDirective 93/13\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In order to ‚Äòfacilitate the establishment of the internal market‚Äô and provide ‚Äòmore effective protection of the consumer‚Äô within that market (sixth, eighth and tenth recitals in the preamble), the Council approved Directive 93/13 on 5 April 1993.\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Under Article¬†3(1):\n\n‚ÄòA contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer‚Äô.\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article¬†4(1) provides that:\n\n‚ÄòWithout prejudice to Article¬†7, the unfairness of a contractual term shall be assessed, taking into account the nature of the goods or services for which the contract was concluded and by referring, at the time of conclusion of the contract, to all the circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract and to all the other terms of the contract or of another contract on which it is dependent‚Äô.\n\n6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article¬†6(1) establishes that:\n\n‚ÄòMember States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall, as provided for under their national law, not be binding on the consumer ‚Ä¶‚Äô.\n\n7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article¬†7 in turn provides that:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Member States shall ensure that, in the interests of consumers and of competitors, adequate and effective means exist to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The means referred to in paragraph 1 shall include provisions whereby persons or organisations, having a legitimate interest under national law in protecting consumers, may take action according to the national law concerned before the courts or before competent administrative bodies for a decision as to whether contractual terms drawn up for general use are unfair, so that they can apply appropriate and effective means to prevent the continued use of such terms‚Äô.\n\n8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Finally, it should be noted that the Directive has an annex which contains an indicative list of terms which may be regarded as unfair.

The contract contained an arbitration clause under which any disputes arising from the contract were to be referred for settlement by an arbitrator designated by the Asociaci√≥n Europea de Arbitraje de Derecho y Equidad (European Association of Arbitration in Law and in Equity, hereinafter ‚ÄòAEADE‚Äô).\n\n17.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On establishing that the minimum subscription period had not been completed, Centro M√≥vil initiated arbitration proceedings before the AEADE, which granted Ms¬†Mostaza Claro a period of 10 days in which to decide whether to refuse arbitration or to file submissions and present evidence to the arbitrator in support of her position. Ms¬†Mostaza Claro put forward a number of arguments in her defence within the allotted time but did not claim that the arbitration clause was void.\n\n18.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The arbitrator concluded that Ms¬†Mostaza Claro‚Äôs arguments were unfounded and accordingly gave a decision on 22 September 2003 awarding Centro M√≥vil compensation for the damage which it had suffered and reimbursement of the costs incurred in the proceedings.\n\n19.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Ms¬†Mostaza Claro challenged that decision before the Audiencia Provincial. Before that court, the applicant claimed for the first time that the arbitration clause was unfair and that the award should consequently be annulled. Centro M√≥vil opposed the application, arguing that, under Article¬†23 of Law¬†36/1988, the claim that the clause was void ought to have been raised in the arbitration proceedings and could not therefore be taken into consideration in the judicial proceedings for annulment of the award.\n\n20.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Audiencia Provincial found that, under Law 26/1984 (Articles¬†10, 10a and the first additional provision) and Law¬†7/1998 (Article¬†8), the arbitration clause included in the contract was unfair. However, in the absence of a specific challenge by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings, it doubted whether it could of its own motion declare that the clause was void.\n\n21.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On those grounds, the Audiencia Provincial referred the following question to the Court:\n\n‚ÄòMay the protection of consumers under Council Directive¬†93/13/EEC of 5¬†April¬†1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts require the court hearing an action for annulment of an arbitration award to determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and to annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the consumer‚Äôs detriment, when that issue is raised in the action for annulment but was not raised by the consumer in the arbitration proceedings?‚Äô\n\n22.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the proceedings thus instituted, written observations have been submitted by Centro M√≥vil, the Spanish, German, Hungarian and Finnish Governments, and the Commission.\n\nIII¬†‚Äì¬†¬†**Legal analysis**\n\n_Introduction: the question of the unfair nature of the arbitration clause at issue in the main proceedings_\n\n23.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Before taking a position on the question referred to the Court, the parties which submitted written observations first spent a significant period of time considering a preliminary question, namely whether the arbitration clause at issue in the main proceedings really is an unfair term, that is to say, ‚Äòa contractual term which has not been individually negotiated‚Äô and which, ‚Äòcontrary to the requirement of good faith, ‚Ä¶ causes a significant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer‚Äô (Article¬†3(1) of the Directive).\n\n24.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Centro M√≥vil takes the view that the existence of a term prohibited by Directive 93/13 can be excluded in the present case inasmuch as, having entered into the telephone subscription contract in the context of her own professional activity, Ms Mostaza Claro could not be regarded as a ‚Äòconsumer‚Äô. It also claims that the clause in question was individually negotiated with the applicant and consequently did not come within the ambit of Article¬†3.\n\n25.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Hungarian Government, by contrast, considers that it is not clear from the order for reference whether the clause in question satisfies the requirements laid down in Directive 93/13. It adds that, in any event, the Directive does not require Member States to regard as unfair all terms of consumer contracts which provide legally recognised alternative means of settling disputes.\n\n26.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The position of the Finnish Government and the Commission is different again. In their view, the clause at issue in the main proceedings undoubtedly satisfies the requirements laid down in the abovementioned Article¬†3. In particular, according to the Finnish Government, it causes a significant contractual imbalance to the detriment of the consumer, who as a rule does not have the necessary legal expertise to assess the implications arising from the inclusion of an arbitration clause in the contract. The Finnish Government and the Commission add that the clause is among those figuring on the indicative list in the annex to the Directive, notably under (q), which refers to terms which have ‚Äòthe object or effect of ‚Ä¶ excluding or hindering the consumer‚Äôs right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy‚Äô.\n\n27.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†For my part, I am inclined rather to share the view taken by the Commission and the Finnish Government on this issue. Apart from that, however, it seems to me that there is another question that ought to be asked at this point.\n\n28.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As we know, in the context of its jurisdiction under Article¬†234¬†EC to interpret Community law, the Court may indeed ‚Äòinterpret general criteria used by the Community legislature in order to define the concept of unfair terms‚Äô. However, it may not ‚Äòrule on the application of these general criteria to a particular term‚Äô, which, under Article¬†4 of the Directive, must be considered in the light of all the circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract in ‚Äòthe case in question‚Äô, circumstances of which the national court alone has direct knowledge.¬†([6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote6))\n\n29.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the division of functions provided for by the Treaty, it is for the national court, which alone has direct knowledge of those circumstances, ‚Äòto decide whether [the] contractual term ‚Ä¶ at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article¬†3(1) of the Directive‚Äô.¬†([7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote7))\n\n30.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Nor can any different conclusion be drawn from the case of¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial_,¬†([8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote8)) in which however ‚Äì as the Commission has pointed out ‚Äì the Court made that assessment. In its subsequent judgment in¬†_Freiburger Kommunalbauten_,¬†([9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote9)) the Court explained that the aforementioned case represents a precedent that is most exceptional and is therefore not generally applicable.\n\n31.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to the Court, the main proceedings in¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial_¬†concerned a jurisdiction clause which conferred ‚Äòjurisdiction in respect of all disputes arising under the contract on the court in the territorial jurisdiction of which the seller [had] his principal place of business‚Äô. The term in question was thus ‚Äòsolely to the benefit of the seller and contained no benefit in return for the consumer‚Äô and was therefore quite patently unfair. That was the only ground on which it was possible for the Court to hold that the term was unfair ‚Äòwithout having to consider all the circumstances in which the contract was concluded‚Äô.¬†([10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote10))\n\n32.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In most cases, however, it will not be clear that the term is unfair and it is therefore for the national court to determine whether the criteria laid down in Article¬†3(1) of the Directive apply in those cases.\n\n33.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the present case, the referring court did in fact consider whether the arbitration clause in question was unfair. In its order for reference, the Audiencia Provincial held that ‚Äòthere is no doubt that the arbitration agreement included in the promotional contract for a mobile telephone concluded between Ms Mostaza Claro and Centro M√≥vil Milenium is tainted with invalidity on account of its containing an unfair term‚Äô within the meaning of the national law transposing Directive 93/13.\n\n34.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In that situation, I therefore consider that the Court can do no more than take note of that assessment. Especially, I should add, as the referring court has not in fact asked about the nature of the term but only whether it can declare of its own motion that the term is unlawful.\n\n35.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It should be noted that, in accordance with settled case-law, under the Treaty attribution of areas of competence, it is for the national court to determine the questions which are relevant for the purpose of settling the dispute in the main proceedings and the questions on which the Court is in principle required to rule.¬†([11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote11))\n\n36.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Only exceptionally, and in so far as it is necessary in order to give an answer which will be ‚Äòuseful to the national court‚Äô, may the Court modify the questions and/or examine new questions.¬†([12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote12)) However, no one has claimed, nor does it appear from the documents in the case, that circumstances of this kind obtain in the present case.\n\n37.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I therefore conclude that in the present case it is necessary to concur with the assessment of the national court, which found that the term at issue in the main proceedings is unfair. I therefore propose to examine the question posited in the light of that finding.\n\n_The question_\n\n38.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As we have seen, by its single question, the national court seeks to ascertain whether the system for the protection of consumers established by the Directive requires that a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine of its own motion that an arbitration clause which has been found to be unfair is void and consequently to annul the award, even if the consumer did not enter a plea to that effect in the course of the arbitration proceedings and did so for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\n39.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In this connection, I agree with the Spanish, Hungarian and Finnish Governments and the Commission that, in the light of the case-law of the Court, that question can be answered in the affirmative.\n\n40.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Indeed, the Court has already recognised that national courts may determine of their own motion, in cases where the seller or supplier seeks enforcement of a contract, that unfair terms in contracts are unlawful.\n\n41.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the judgment in¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial_, ¬†([13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote13)) cited above, the Court pointed out that Article¬†7(2) of the Directive allows authorised consumer associations to take action in order to obtain a decision as to whether terms drawn up for general use are unfair and, if need be, to have them prohibited, even if they have not been used in specific contracts. The reason for this, according to the Court, is that that provision is part of a system of protection ‚Äòbased on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-√†-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge‚Äô and that such a situation ‚Äòmay only be corrected by positive action unconnected with the actual parties to the contract‚Äô.¬†([14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote14))\n\n42.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to the Court, in a system that allows actions of this kind, ‚Äòit is hardly conceivable that ‚Ä¶ a court hearing a dispute on a specific contract containing an unfair term should not be able to set aside application of the relevant term solely because the consumer has not raised the fact that it is unfair‚Äô.¬†([15](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote15)) Conversely, it is consistent with such a system to allow positive action by the national court in the form of a determination of its own motion that the term is unlawful and, if need be, non‚Äëapplication of the term in question.\n\n43.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Court subsequently added, in the judgment in¬†_Cofidis_, that courts must be accorded the power to determine the illegality of an unfair term even if the consumer fails to raise the unfair nature of the term within the time-limit fixed under national law.¬†([16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote16))\n\n44.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In this connection, the Court pointed out that the protection provided for consumers under Directive 93/13 was intended to be ‚Äòeffective protection‚Äô and to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers by sellers or suppliers (Article 7) and to prevent an individual consumer from being bound by an unfair term in a contract (Article 6).¬†([17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote17))\n\n45.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to the Court, the effectiveness of that protection is liable to be adversely affected, in proceedings brought by sellers or suppliers, by ‚Äòthe real risk that [the consumer] is unaware of his rights‚Äô or is deterred ‚Äòfrom enforcing them on account of the costs which judicial proceedings would involve‚Äô. To prevent that risk, the power in question must therefore also extend, at least in proceedings brought by sellers or suppliers, to ‚Äòcases in which a consumer ‚Ä¶ fails to raise the unfair nature‚Äô of the term in the contract before the ‚Äòexpiry of a limitation period‚Äô fixed by the national legislature.¬†([18](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote18))\n\n46.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Centro M√≥vil and the German Government, however, contend that the abovementioned considerations do not apply in the present case. In this case, the risk that the protection of the consumer might be adversely affected is precluded by the fact that Ms Mostaza Claro was at liberty, under the arbitration clause, to refuse arbitration and, under Article¬†23 of Law¬†36/1988, to argue that the clause in question was void in the initial statement of defence submitted to the arbitrator.\n\n47.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I note, however, that in the present case, just as in¬†_Cofidis_, there was a real risk (which in fact materialised) that in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the seller, the consumer might fail to exercise that power out of ignorance or fear of the costs of an action before the ordinary judicial authorities, which she would have to meet once the arbitration agreement had been rejected or declared void.\n\n48.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Not only that, but the time she was given to choose between availing herself of that option or abandoning hope of reaching a speedier and less costly resolution of the dispute was so short as to render it excessively difficult, if not impossible, for her to exercise the choice in question. It is apparent from the order for reference that, under the arbitration clause drafted by Centro M√≥vil, all disputes arising under the contract were to be submitted to an arbitration body (AEADE) which granted Ms Mostaza Claro a period of only 10 days in which to refuse arbitration or, if she did not refuse arbitration, to file submissions and present evidence in her defence.\n\n49.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Thus, contrary to what Centro M√≥vil and the German Government contend, the consumer‚Äôs right to a fair hearing appears to be severely limited under that procedure.\n\n50.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Centro M√≥vil and the German Government, however, also raise a different material objection to extending the findings in¬†_Oc√©ano Grupo Editorial_¬†and¬†_Cofidis_¬†to the present case. In their view, to allow the court hearing the action for annulment to determine the illegality of the arbitration clause even if no plea to that effect was entered within the prescribed time-limit would be highly prejudicial to the requirement of efficiency and certainty in arbitration decisions. That was, however, a requirement that the Spanish legislation was designed to preserve, specifically by fixing procedural limits for claims relating to the arbitration clause and by restricting the cases in which the award could be annulled to those contained in an exhaustive list (Articles 23 and 45 of Law 36/1988).\n\n51.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is undoubtedly in the interest of ‚Äòefficient arbitration proceedings‚Äô that ‚Äòreview of arbitration awards‚Äô should be limited in scope.¬†([19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote19)) As Centro M√≥vil and the German Government have rightly pointed out, that requirement is reflected in numerous procedural rules and various international instruments¬†([20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote20)) which identify a specific number of cases in which ‚Äòannulment of or refusal to recognise an award‚Äô is possible.¬†([21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote21))\n\n52.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, it does not seem to me that there is any risk of that requirement being subverted in the present case. The Spanish legislation, like most of the national legislation and international instruments on the subject,¬†([22](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote22)) includes among the cases in which an award may be annulled those where the award is contrary to public policy (Article¬†45(5) of Law¬†36/1988), irrespective of any challenge by the parties.\n\n53.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Moreover, the Court held in the celebrated judgment in¬†_Eco Swiss_¬†that ‚Äòwhere its domestic rules of procedure require a national court to grant an application for annulment of an arbitration award where such an application is founded on failure to observe national rules of public policy, it must also grant such an application where it is founded on failure to comply with‚Äô similar Community rules.¬†([23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote23))\n\n54.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Court held in that case that such rules include Article¬†81¬†EC, which in its view is to be regarded as a matter of public policy inasmuch as it constitutes a ‚Äòfundamental‚Äô provision which is ‚Äòessential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market‚Äô.¬†([24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote24))\n\n55.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On the basis of that precedent, and in view of the importance attached to consumer protection in the Community legal order, the Commission considers that the provisions of Directive 93/13 can also be regarded as rules of public policy. In its view, the provisions in question are harmonising provisions approved for the purpose of providing more efficient protection for the consumer within the internal market. They are thus important provisions designed to contribute to ‚Äòthe strengthening of consumer protection‚Äô, a task mentioned in Article¬†3(1)(t)¬†EC as one of the fundamental activities of the Community. The national courts are consequently required to ensure that those provisions are respected in actions for annulment of arbitration awards, even where ‚Äì as in the present case ‚Äì the failure to comply with the provisions has not been challenged in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n56.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I would not in principle here preclude the possibility that that may be a legitimate approach in this case. However, I fear that it is open to the objection that it might give excessively wide scope to a concept, namely that of public policy, which traditionally refers only to rules that are regarded as being of primary and absolute importance in a legal order.\n\n57.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In any event, it does not seem to me that the path proposed by the Commission is the only possible way of enabling a court to determine of its own motion the illegality of an award in proceedings for annulment. I consider, in fact, that in line with the general direction of Community case-law and the precedents cited above, the Court should be permitted to make that determination in the present case because it is a matter of ensuring observance of a fundamental principle of the legal order, namely the right to a fair hearing.\n\n58.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As we saw earlier (see point 48 et seq.), it is precisely and principally that right which is seriously compromised by the term at issue in the present case.\n\n59.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to the settled case-law of the Court, the right to be heard must be guaranteed ‚Äòin all proceedings initiated against a person which are liable to culminate in a measure adversely affecting that person‚Äô,¬†([25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote25)) thus also in arbitration proceedings. Observance of that right is ‚Äòa fundamental principle of Community law‚Äô and it is ‚Äòone of the fundamental rights deriving from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States‚Äô.¬†([26](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote26))\n\n60.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On that ground, it can therefore indeed be said that we have here a principle that forms part of the concept of Community public policy as adopted by the Court.\n\n61.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This is confirmed, moreover, by the judgment in¬†_Krombach_, in which the Court was asked to interpret Article¬†27, point 1, of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters.¬†([27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote27)) Under that provision, the courts of a Contracting State (the State in which enforcement is sought) may refuse to recognise a judgment delivered in another Contracting State (the State of origin) if such recognition is ‚Äòcontrary to public policy‚Äô. The Court, having noted that observance of the right to be defended occupies a prominent position in the Community legal order, accordingly held that recourse to the ‚Äòpublic-policy‚Äô clause in the Convention must be permitted, since in that particular case the guarantees laid down in the legislation of the State of origin ‚Äò[had] been insufficient to protect the defendant from a manifest breach of his right to defend himself‚Äô.¬†([28](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footnote28))\n\n62.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the light of the considerations set out above, I therefore take the view that the system for the protection of consumers established by Directive 93/13 requires that, in a case such as the present one, a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine that an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul the award on the ground that it is contrary to public policy, even if that defect was not contested by the consumer in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\nIV¬†‚Äì¬†¬†**Conclusion**\n\n63.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the light of the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court give the following answer to the question referred by the Audiencia Provincial de Madrid:\n\nThe system for the protection of consumers established by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5¬†April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts requires that, in a case such as the present one, a national court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award be able to determine that an arbitration clause is unfair and to annul the award on the ground that it is contrary to public policy, even if that defect was not contested by the consumer in the course of the arbitration proceedings and is raised for the first time in the application for annulment.\n\n---\n\n[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref1)¬†‚Äì Original language: Italian.\n\n---\n\n[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref2)¬†‚Äì OJ 1993 L¬†95, p.¬†29.\n\n---\n\n[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref3)¬†‚Äì Ley 7/1998, Sobre Condiciones Generales de la Contrataci√≥n (Law 7/1998 of 13 April 1998 on general contractual conditions) (_Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado_¬†(Official State Gazette) (‚ÄòBOE‚Äô)¬†No¬†89 of 14 April 1998, p.¬†12304).\n\n---\n\n[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref4)¬†‚Äì¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Ley 26/1984, General para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios (Law 26/1984 of 19 July 1984 for the protection of consumers and users) (BOE¬†No¬†176 of 24 July 1984, p.¬†21686).\n\n---\n\n[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref5)¬†‚Äì Ley 36/1988 de Arbitraje (Law¬†36/1988 of 5¬†December¬†1988 on arbitration) (BOE No 293 of 7 December 1988, p.¬†34605).\n\n---\n\n[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62005CC0168#Footref6)¬†‚Äì Judgment in Case C-237/02¬†_Freiburger Kommunalbauten_¬†[2004] ECR I-3403, paragraph 22.

It should be borne in mind in that regard that Regulation No 44/2001, apart from a few limited exceptions, does not authorise the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to be reviewed by a court in another Member State.\n\nSecondly, in obstructing the court of another Member State in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001, namely to decide, on the basis of the rules defining the material scope of that regulation, including Article¬†1(2)(d) thereof, whether that regulation is applicable, such an anti-suit injunction also runs counter to the trust which the Member States accord to one another‚Äôs legal systems and judicial institutions and on which the system of jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001 is based.\n\nLastly, if, by means of an anti-suit injunction, the national court were prevented from examining itself the preliminary issue of the validity or the applicability of the arbitration agreement, a party could avoid the proceedings merely by relying on that agreement and the applicant, which considers that the agreement is void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, would thus be barred from access to the court before which it brought proceedings under Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 and would therefore be deprived of a form of judicial protection to which it is entitled.\n\nThis finding is supported by Article II(3) of The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on 10 June 1958, according to which it is the court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an arbitration agreement, that will, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n\n(see paras 26-31, 33-34, operative part)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber)\n\n10 February 2009 ([*](#Footnote*))\n\n(Recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards ‚Äì Regulation (EC) No¬†44/2001 ‚Äì Scope of application ‚Äì Jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to issue an order restraining a party from commencing or continuing proceedings before a court of another Member State on the ground that those proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement ‚Äì New York¬†Convention)\n\nIn Case C‚Äë185/07,\n\nREFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Articles 68 EC and 234 EC from the House of Lords (United Kingdom), made by decision of 28 March 2007, received at the Court on 2 April 2007, in the proceedings\n\n**Allianz SpA**, formerly Riunione Adriatica di Sicurt√† SpA,\n\n**Generali Assicurazioni Generali SpA**,\n\nv\n\n**West Tankers Inc.**,\n\nTHE COURT (Grand Chamber),\n\ncomposed of V.

(‚ÄòWest Tankers‚Äô) concerning West Tankers‚Äô liability in tort.\n\n¬†**Legal context**\n\n¬†_International law_\n\n3¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on 10 June 1958 (_United Nations Treaty Series_, Vol. 330, p.¬†3) (‚Äòthe New York Convention‚Äô), provides as follows in Article II(3):\n\n‚ÄòThe court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.‚Äô\n\n¬†_Community law_\n\n4¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†According to recital 25 in the preamble to Regulation No¬†44/2001:\n\n‚ÄòRespect for international commitments entered into by the Member States means that this Regulation should not affect conventions relating to specific matters to which the Member States are parties.‚Äô\n\n5¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Article 1(1) and (2) of that regulation provides:\n\n‚Äò1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This Regulation shall apply in civil and commercial matters whatever the nature of the court or tribunal.

The charterparty was governed by English law and contained a clause providing for arbitration in London (United Kingdom).\n\n10¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Erg claimed compensation from its insurers Allianz and Generali up to the limit of its insurance cover and commenced arbitration proceedings in London against West Tankers for the excess. West Tankers denied liability for the damage caused by the collision.\n\n11¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Having paid Erg compensation under the insurance policies for the loss it had suffered, Allianz and Generali brought proceedings on 30 July 2003 against West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa (Italy) in order to recover the sums they had paid to Erg. The action was based on their statutory right of subrogation to Erg‚Äôs claims, in accordance with Article 1916 of the Italian Civil Code. West Tankers raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction on the basis of the existence of the arbitration agreement.\n\n12¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In parallel, West Tankers brought proceedings, on 10 September 2004, before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court), seeking a declaration that the dispute between itself, on the one hand, and Allianz and Generali, on the other, was to be settled by arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement. West Tankers also sought an injunction restraining Allianz and Generali from pursuing any proceedings other than arbitration and requiring them to discontinue the proceedings commenced before the Tribunale di Siracusa (‚Äòthe anti-suit injunction‚Äô).\n\n13¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†By judgment of 21 March 2005, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court), upheld West Tankers‚Äô claims and granted the anti-suit injunction sought against Allianz and Generali. The latter appealed against that judgment to the House of Lords. They argued that the grant of such an injunction is contrary to Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n14¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The House of Lords first referred to the judgments in Case C-116/02¬†_Gasser_¬†[2003] ECR I-14693 and Case C-159/02¬†_Turner_¬†[2004] ECR I‚Äë3565, which decided in substance that an injunction restraining a party from commencing or continuing proceedings in a court of a Member State cannot be compatible with the system established by Regulation No 44/2001, even where it is granted by the court having jurisdiction under that regulation. That is because the regulation provides a complete set of uniform rules on the allocation of jurisdiction between the courts of the Member States which must trust each other to apply those rules correctly.\n\n15¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, that principle cannot, in the view of the House of Lords, be extended to arbitration, which is completely excluded from the scope of Regulation No¬†44/2001 by virtue of Article 1(2)(d) thereof. In that field, there is no set of uniform Community rules, which is a necessary condition in order that mutual trust between the courts of the Member States may be established and applied. Moreover, it is clear from the judgment in Case C-190/89¬†_Rich_¬†[1991] ECR¬†I‚Äë3855 that the exclusion in Article 1(2)(d) of Regulation No 44/2001 applies not only to arbitration proceedings as such, but also to legal proceedings the subject-matter of which is arbitration. The judgment in Case C-391/95¬†_Van Uden_¬†[1998] ECR I-7091 stated that arbitration is the subject-matter of proceedings where they serve to protect the right to determine the dispute by arbitration, which is the case in the main proceedings.\n\n16¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The House of Lords adds that since all arbitration matters fall outside the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, an injunction addressed to Allianz and Generali restraining them from having recourse to proceedings other than arbitration and from continuing proceedings before the Tribunale di Siracusa cannot infringe the regulation.\n\n17¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Finally, the House of Lords points out that the courts of the United Kingdom have for many years used anti-suit injunctions. That practice is, in its view, a valuable tool for the court of the seat of arbitration, exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, as it promotes legal certainty and reduces the possibility of conflict between the arbitration award and the judgment of a national court. Furthermore, if the practice were also adopted by the courts in other Member States it would make the European Community more competitive vis-√†-vis international arbitration centres such as New York, Bermuda and Singapore.\n\n18¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In those circumstances, the House of Lords decided to stay its proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\n‚ÄòIs it consistent with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings in another Member State on the ground that such proceedings are in breach of an arbitration agreement?‚Äô\n\n¬†**The question referred for a preliminary ruling**\n\n19¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†By its question, the House of Lords asks, essentially, whether it is incompatible with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State on the ground that such proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement, even though Article 1(2)(d) of the regulation excludes arbitration from the scope thereof.\n\n20¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†An anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, may be directed against actual or potential claimants in proceedings abroad. As observed by the Advocate General in point 14 of her Opinion, non-compliance with an anti-suit injunction is contempt of court, for which penalties can be imposed, including imprisonment or seizure of assets.\n\n21¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Both West Tankers and the United Kingdom Government submit that such an injunction is not incompatible with Regulation No¬†44/2001 because Article¬†1(2)(d) thereof excludes arbitration from its scope of application.\n\n22¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In that regard it must be borne in mind that, in order to determine whether a dispute falls within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, reference must be made solely to the subject-matter of the proceedings (_Rich_, paragraph 26). More specifically, its place in the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 is determined by the nature of the rights which the proceedings in question serve to protect (_Van Uden_, paragraph 33).\n\n23¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Proceedings, such as those in the main proceedings, which lead to the making of an anti-suit injunction, cannot, therefore, come within the scope of Regulation No¬†44/2001.\n\n24¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†However, even though proceedings do not come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, they may nevertheless have consequences which undermine its effectiveness, namely preventing the attainment of the objectives of unification of the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and the free movement of decisions in those matters. This is so, inter alia, where such proceedings prevent a court of another Member State from exercising the jurisdiction conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n25¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It is therefore appropriate to consider whether the proceedings brought by Allianz and Generali against West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa themselves come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 and then to ascertain the effects of the anti-suit injunction on those proceedings.\n\n26¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In that regard, the Court finds, as noted by the Advocate General in points 53 and 54 of her Opinion, that, if, because of the subject-matter of the dispute, that is, the nature of the rights to be protected in proceedings, such as a claim for damages, those proceedings come within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001, a preliminary issue concerning the applicability of an arbitration agreement, including in particular its validity, also comes within its scope of application. This finding is supported by paragraph 35 of the Report on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (OJ 1978 L 304, p. 36) (‚Äòthe Brussels Convention‚Äô), presented by Messrs Evrigenis and Kerameus (OJ 1986 C 298, p. 1). That paragraph states that the verification, as an incidental question, of the validity of an arbitration agreement which is cited by a litigant in order to contest the jurisdiction of the court before which he is being sued pursuant to the Brussels Convention, must be considered as falling within its scope.\n\n27¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It follows that the objection of lack of jurisdiction raised by West Tankers before the Tribunale di Siracusa on the basis of the existence of an arbitration agreement, including the question of the validity of that agreement, comes within the scope of Regulation No 44/2001 and that it is therefore exclusively for that court to rule on that objection and on its own jurisdiction, pursuant to Articles 1(2)(d) and 5(3) of that regulation.\n\n28¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accordingly, the use of an anti-suit injunction to prevent a court of a Member State, which normally has jurisdiction to resolve a dispute under Article 5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001, from ruling, in accordance with Article 1(2)(d) of that regulation, on the very applicability of the regulation to the dispute brought before it necessarily amounts to stripping that court of the power to rule on its own jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n29¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It follows, first, as noted by the Advocate General in point 57 of her Opinion, that an anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, is contrary to the general principle which emerges from the case-law of the Court on the Brussels Convention, that every court seised itself determines, under the rules applicable to it, whether it has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute before it (see, to that effect,¬†_Gasser_, paragraphs 48 and 49). It should be borne in mind in that regard that Regulation No 44/2001, apart from a few limited exceptions which are not relevant to the main proceedings, does not authorise the jurisdiction of a court of a Member State to be reviewed by a court in another Member State (Case C‚Äë351/89¬†_Overseas Union Insurance and Others_¬†[1991] ECR I-3317, paragraph 24, and¬†_Turner_, paragraph 26). That jurisdiction is determined directly by the rules laid down by that regulation, including those relating to its scope of application. Thus in no case is a court of one Member State in a better position to determine whether the court of another Member State has jurisdiction (_Overseas__Union Insurance and Others_, paragraph 23, and¬†_Gasser_, paragraph 48).\n\n30¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Further, in obstructing the court of another Member State in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Regulation No 44/2001, namely to decide, on the basis of the rules defining the material scope of that regulation, including Article¬†1(2)(d) thereof, whether that regulation is applicable, such an anti-suit injunction also runs counter to the trust which the Member States accord to one another‚Äôs legal systems and judicial institutions and on which the system of jurisdiction under Regulation No 44/2001 is based (see, to that effect,¬†_Turner_, paragraph 24).\n\n31¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Lastly, if, by means of an anti-suit injunction, the Tribunale di Siracusa were prevented from examining itself the preliminary issue of the validity or the applicability of the arbitration agreement, a party could avoid the proceedings merely by relying on that agreement and the applicant, which considers that the agreement is void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, would thus be barred from access to the court before which it brought proceedings under Article¬†5(3) of Regulation No 44/2001 and would therefore be deprived of a form of judicial protection to which it is entitled.\n\n32¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Consequently, an anti-suit injunction, such as that in the main proceedings, is not compatible with Regulation No 44/2001.\n\n33¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This finding is supported by Article II(3) of the New York Convention, according to which it is the court of a Contracting State, when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an arbitration agreement, that will, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n\n34¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that it is incompatible with Regulation No 44/2001 for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State on the ground that such proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement.\n\n¬†**Costs**\n\n35¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\n**It is incompatible with Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters for a court of a Member State to make an order to restrain a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State on the ground that such proceedings would be contrary to an arbitration agreement.**\n\n[Signatures]\n\n---\n\n[*](#Footref*)¬†Language of the case: English.","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.115670017Z","tags":null},"/setup/config":{"title":"Customization","content":"\n# Configuration\nAmethyst is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `config.yaml`. An example, with descriptions for each setting, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/config.yaml).\n\n### Code Block Titles\nTo add code block titles with Amethyst:\n\n1. Ensure that code block titles are enabled in the configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Amethyst's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`. The default configuration, with descriptions, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/data/graphConfig.yaml).\n\n### Language Support\n[Chinese, Japanese, and Korean support](features/language.md) comes out of the box with Amethyst.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Amethyst) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.yaml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ndefaultContentLanguage: ar\nlanguages:\n  ar:\n    languagedirection: rtl\n    title: ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä\n    weight: 2\n```\n\n# Custom Styles\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling in `assets/_custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Changing the Color Scheme\nThe default color schemes for light mode and dark mode are located in `assets/_colors.scss`. You can replace the values for existing color variables for drop-in edits, or create new variables to reference in `_custom.scss`.\n\n### Changing the Fonts\nAll fonts are defined in `assets/_fonts.scss`. There are examples for both local fonts (defined using `@font-face`) and webfonts (fetched with `@import` from a font distributor such as Google Fonts).\n\nYou can place all local fonts in the `static/fonts` folder.\n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](setup/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](setup/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](setup/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](setup/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/setup/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/setup/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Amethyst needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](setup/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Amethyst is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nAmethyst isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, [send me a message](https://bencuan.me/contact) using your preferred communication method!\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-09-19T08:58:03.119670056Z","tags":null},"/setup/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Amethyst in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
