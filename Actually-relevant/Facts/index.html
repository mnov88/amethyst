<a href=https://www.facebook.com rel=noopener>www.facebook.com</a>, services that are free of charge for private users. Other undertakings of the Meta group offer, within the European Union, other online services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.</p><p><mark>27      The business model of the online social network Facebook is based on financing through online advertising, which is tailored to the individual users of the social network according, inter alia, to their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Such advertising is made possible in technical terms by the automated production of detailed profiles in respect of the network users and the users of the online services offered at the level of the Meta group.</mark> To that end, in addition to the data provided by the users directly when they sign up for the online services concerned, <mark>other user- and device-related data are also collected on and off that social network and the online services provided by the Meta group, and linked to their various user accounts</mark>. The aggregate view of the data allows detailed conclusions to be drawn about those users’ preferences and interests.</p><p>28      For the processing of those data, Meta Platforms Ireland relies on the user agreement to which the users of the social network Facebook adhere when they click on the ‘Sign up’ button, thereby accepting the general terms drawn up by that company. Acceptance of those terms is necessary in order to be able to use the social network Facebook. With regard to the processing of personal data, the general terms refer to that company’s data and cookies policies. According to those policies, Meta Platforms Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and links the data with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned. <mark>The latter data, relating to activities outside the social network (‘the off-Facebook data’), are data concerning visits to third-party webpages and apps, which are linked to Facebook through programming interfaces – ‘Facebook Business Tools’ – as well as data concerning the use of other online services belonging to the Meta group, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and – until 13 March 2020 – Masquerade.</mark></p><p>29      The Federal Cartel Office brought proceedings against Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland, as a result of which, by decision of 6 February 2019, based on Paragraph 19(1) and Paragraph 32 of the GWB, it essentially prohibited those companies from making, in the general terms, <mark>the use of the social network Facebook by private users resident in Germany subject to the processing of their off-Facebook data and from processing the data without their consent on the basis of the general terms in force at the time</mark>. In addition, it required them to adapt those general terms in such a way that it is made clear that those data will neither be collected, nor linked with Facebook user accounts nor used without the consent of the user concerned, and it clarified the fact that such a consent is not valid if it is a condition for using the social network.</p><p>30      The Federal Cartel Office based its decision on the fact that the processing of the data of the users concerned, as provided for in the general terms and implemented by Meta Platforms Ireland, constituted an abuse of that company’s dominant position on the market for online social networks for private users in Germany, within the meaning of Paragraph 19(1) of the GWB. In particular, according to the Federal Cartel Office, those general terms, as a result of that dominant position, constitute an abuse since the processing of the off-Facebook data that they provide for is not consistent with the underlying values of the GDPR and, in particular, it cannot be justified in the light of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2) of that regulation.</p><p>31      On 11 February 2019, Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland brought an action against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office before the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany).</p><p>32      On 31 July 2019, Meta Platforms Ireland introduced new general terms expressly stating that the user, instead of paying to use Facebook products, agrees to being shown advertisements.</p><p>33      Furthermore, since 28 January 2020, Meta Platforms has been offering, at a global level, ‘<em>Off-Facebook Activity</em>’, which allows the users of the social network Facebook to view a summary of the information about them that Meta group companies obtain in relation to their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect the data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish.</p><p>34      The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) has doubts (i) as to whether national competition authorities may review, in the exercise of their powers, whether the processing of personal data complies with the requirements set out in the GDPR; (ii) as to whether the operator of an online social network may process the data subject’s sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation; (iii) as to the lawfulness of the processing by such an operator of the personal data of the user concerned, under Article 6(1) of that regulation; and (iv) as to the validity, in the light of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) and Article 9(2)(a) of that regulation, of the consent given to an undertaking with a dominant position on the national market for online social networks for the purposes of such processing.</p><p><mark>(3)      Can an undertaking, such as [Meta Platforms  Ireland], which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and consistent, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as “Facebook Business Tools”, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?</mark></p><h1 id=ag>AG
<a class=anchor href=#ag>#</a></h1><p>9.        Meta Platforms operates the online social network ‘Facebook’ in the European Union (
<a href=https://www.facebook.com rel=noopener>www.facebook.com</a>), as well as other online services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The business model of the social networks operated by Meta Platforms essentially consists of offering social network services free of charge for private users and selling online advertising. The advertising is tailored to individual users and aims to show them products and services that might interest them on the basis of, inter alia, their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. The technical basis for this type of advertising is the automated production of detailed profiles of users of Facebook and the online services offered at group level. (

Acceptance of those terms of service is an essential requirement for using the Facebook social network. (

The Federal Cartel Office based its decision, inter alia, on the fact that under Paragraph 19 of the GWB, the processing in question constituted an abuse of the company’s dominant position in the social media market for private users in Germany. (

In essence, the referring court has doubts as to the ability of national competition authorities to monitor the compliance of data processing with the requirements laid down in the GDPR and to determine and penalise breaches of the GDPR. It also has doubts as to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of that regulation.</p><p>13.      In those circumstances, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:</p><p><mark>(3)      Can an undertaking, such as Facebook Ireland, which operates a digital social network funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement and continuous, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools, or via cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the internet user’s computer or mobile device, linking those data with the user’s [Facebook] account and using them, on the ground of necessity for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR or on the ground of the pursuit of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?</mark></p><h1 id=reference>Reference
<a class=anchor href=#reference>#</a></h1><p>The second applicant (‘Facebook Ireland’) operates the digital social network Facebook.com in Europe, a network that is free of charge for private users. The first applicant is its US parent company. The third applicant is a German sister company of Facebook Ireland that provides it with advertising, communication and public relations support (jointly also ‘Facebook’).</p><p>Private users can set up a personal Facebook page on Facebook.com which they can use to communicate with third parties. They can create their own posts in the ‘Newsfeed’ on their Facebook page and share them with their Facebook friends or publicly on the network as they wish; they can also receive communications in their Newsfeed from their Facebook friends or other content providers and undertakings represented on Facebook.com to which they have subscribed. In addition, they can show content from third-party websites and apps in their Newsfeed, and that of their Facebook friends, by clicking or tapping on the social plugins (particularly ‘Like’ or ‘Share’). With ‘Facebook Login’ and ‘Account Kit’, users can log in or create a profile on third-party websites and apps using only their Facebook registration data.</p><p><mark>Facebook offers undertakings the opportunity to integrate the social plugin buttons (particularly Like and Share) and Facebook Login and Account Kit into their websites and apps with predefined interfaces called ‘Facebook Business Tools’. These interfaces transmit user data to Facebook.com, regardless of whether or not the website and app users actually click or tap on the buttons.</mark> #important-fact</p><p>Facebook.com is funded by online advertising, which is tailored to its individual users and aims to show them advertisements that might interest them on the basis of their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Advertisers can use the ‘Ads Manager’ to specify their target audience and have advertisements displayed to users; they can also transmit their [Or. 7] customer lists to Facebook in encrypted form and optimise their advertising by comparing their data with data from the social network. Facebook offers other analysis and measurement tools (advertising reports and ‘Facebook Analytics’), also under Facebook Business Tools, which advertisers can use to measure the success of their advertising, analyse their own online services and obtain aggregated statistics in respect of their target audience. This is also done by integrating interfaces (‘Facebook pixel’ or ‘SDK’ (software development kit)), which record user behaviour on third-party websites and apps, regardless of whether the user takes any corresponding action. #important-fact</p><p>The Facebook group provides other services beyond the social network, including Instagram, the free service funded by advertising for ‘sharing’ photos and short video clips, which is also operated in Europe by Facebook Ireland; WhatsApp, the free service for sending and receiving a variety of media such as text messages, images, videos, contacts, documents, locations, voice messages and calls, which is not funded by advertising and is operated in Europe by WhatsApp Ireland Ltd; and Oculus, which sells virtual reality glasses and software and is operated in Europe by another subsidiary, Facebook Technologies Ireland Ltd. Until 13 March 2020, Facebook also provided the Masquerade service for the editing and ‘sharing’ of photos.</p><p>By clicking on the ‘Sign up’ button on Facebook.com, private users in Europe enter into a contract for the use of the service and agree to Facebook Ireland’s terms of service. Under those terms, Facebook Ireland processes personal data; users are referred in particular to Facebook Ireland’s data and cookies policies for further information. According to those policies, Facebook Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and associates the data with the user’s Facebook.com account. User activities off the social network are visits to third-party websites and apps connected to Facebook.com by programming interfaces (Facebook Business Tools), and the use of the other Facebook services Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, in respect of which data are processed ‘across the other Facebook companies and products’. #important-fact</p><p><mark>By decision of 6 February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (Law against restrictions on competition, ‘the GWB’) from processing data as provided for in the terms of service, under Paragraphs 19(1) and 32 of the GWB and imposed measures to stop them from doing so. The prohibition covers the application of terms of service, including as further specified in data and cookies policies, according to which the use of the Facebook.com network by private users resident in Germany is dependent on Facebook Ireland being able to collect user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade and from visits to third-party websites or apps via Facebook Business Tools without the user’s consent, to link those data with the user’s Facebook.com data and to use them (point 1 of the operative part of the decision). Furthermore, the Federal Cartel Office prohibited the applicants and their associated undertakings as referred to in Paragraph 36(2) of the GWB from implementing those terms with the actual data processing operations performed by Facebook Ireland on the basis of the data and cookies policies (point 2 of the operative part of the decision) and obliged them to amend the terms of service and their implementation so as to make it absolutely clear that user- and device-related data from the use of Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and Masquerade, and from Facebook Business Tools, will not, or not without the user’s consent, be collected, linked to the user’s Facebook.com account and used (point 3 of the operative part of the decision). Finally, the Office made clear, in point 4 of the operative part of its decision, that no consent on the part of the user exists if the provision of Facebook.com is made conditional on consent being given.</mark> #important-fact</p><p>On 11 February 2019, the applicants lodged an appeal against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office with the Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf within the time limit and in the manner prescribed.</p><p>Facebook Ireland introduced new and essentially identical terms of service on 31 July 2019 on the initiative of the European Commission and the national consumer protection organisations of the Member States; point 2 of those terms states expressly that the user agrees to be shown advertisements instead of paying to use Facebook products. Since 28 January 2020, Facebook has provided the ‘off-Facebook activity’ (‘OFA’) tool worldwide. Facebook users can use the tool to view a summary of the information obtained by Facebook about their activities on other websites and apps and disconnect these data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish.
&mldr;</p><p>cc) Since the processing of off-Facebook data, as provided for in the terms of service – including within the group – is lawful if it is justified by at least one of the grounds under Article 6(1)(a) to (f) of the GDPR, and the Court of Justice has already ruled that the identical provision of Article 7 of the preceding Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) provides an exhaustive and conclusive list of cases in which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful and that Member States may neither introduce new principles for the lawful processing of personal data alongside this Article, nor impose additional conditions which would alter the scope of any of the principles provided for therein (see judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion Id, C-40/17 [EU:C:2019:629], paragraph 55, available from JURIS; judgment of 19 October 2016, Breyer, C-582/14, paragraph 57, available from JURIS; judgment of 24 November 2011, ASNEF and FECEMD, C-468/10 and C-469/10, paragraphs 30 and 32, available from JURIS), is the processing of off-Facebook data as provided for in the terms of service only ever justifiable if consent is obtained? For only then could the Federal Cartel Office order that, for data protection reasons, such data may not be processed or may be processed only if consent is given .</p><p>(1) According to point 1 (‘The services we provide’) of its current terms of service (Annex Bf 9), the following contractual services relevant to this case are provided by Facebook Ireland as part of its social network: 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook’s products.</p><p>Facebook Ireland collects the user- and device-related data listed in its Data Policy (Annex Bf 10) under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ from the use of its group services and from Facebook Business Tools; it links these data with the data collected and stored while Facebook.com is being used and, according to the section headed ‘How do we use this information?’, uses it to provide, personalise and improve its products, to provide measurement, analytics and other business services, to promote safety, integrity and security, to communicate with users and to research and innovate for social good; according to the [Or. 16] section headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’, it also uses it ‘across the Facebook Companies.’</p><p>According to its Cookies Policy (Annex Bf 11), Facebook Ireland sets cookies or uses other storage technologies when users use the group’s services and visit third-party websites and apps that have integrated Facebook Business Tools, and collects user- and device-related data without any further action by the user; it uses those data to provide its services and for security, advertising and analytics purposes.</p><p>The kinds of data collected and used are detailed in the Data Policy under the heading ‘What kinds of information do we collect?’ (Annex Bf 10) and in point 2(a) to (d) of the operative part of the Office’s decision.</p><p>Facebook Ireland relies in the section of its Data Policy headed ‘What is our legal basis for processing data?’(Annex Bf 10) on all of the grounds under Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Under the heading ‘Learn more about these legal bases’ (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR 1. for processing data with special protections that are provided by users in their Facebook.com profile, for sharing with persons they choose and to personalise content, 2. for using facial recognition technology, 3. for using data that advertisers and other partners provide about users’ activity off Facebook Company Products to personalise advertising, 4. for sharing data that personally identifies users with advertisers, 5. for collecting information that users allow Facebook to receive through the device-based settings they enable (GPS location, camera, photos). Facebook Ireland obtains separate consent from users to process their data for these purposes or offers them the chance to object (in the case of facial recognition).</p><p>In the document referred to (Annex Bf 12), Facebook Ireland relies on the justification of necessity for the performance of the contract within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR 1. to provide, personalise and improve its products, 2. to promote safety, integrity and security, 3. to transfer and transmit data outside the EEA, 4. to communicate with users, 5. to provide consistent and seamless experiences across all Facebook Company Products.</p><p>Facebook Ireland relies on the justification of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR 1. vis-à-vis minors, 2. for providing measurement, analytics and other business services, 3. for providing marketing communications, 4. to research and innovate for social good, 5. to share information with others including law enforcement agencies and to respond to legal requests.</p><p>Facebook Ireland further relies on the justification of compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR), the protection of vital interests (Article 6(1)(d) of the GDPR) and tasks carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) (see Annex Bf 12 for detailed information).</p><p>(2) Consent would be required if and in so far as the collection and linking of data with the Facebook.com account and the use of off-Facebook data involved the processing of special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR and no permission other than consent under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR could be given.</p><p>&mldr;.</p><p>(a) Question 3 of the request seeks to clarify whether, when Facebook Ireland, as referred to above, offers 1. personalised content, 2. personalised advertising, 3. user and network security, 4. product improvement and 5. consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products as contractual services, it can rely on the justification of necessity for the performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, or on the justification of legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, if it collects <strong><mark>off-Facebook</mark></strong> data for these purposes, links those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and uses them.</p><p>The Chamber believes that there is much in the case-law of the Court of Justice with regard to necessity (see judgment of 4 May 2017, Rigas satiksme, C-13/16, paragraph 30, available from JURIS) and the factors taken into consideration by the European Data Protection Board in its Guidelines 2/19 (paragraphs 2, 26 et seq., 48 et seq. and 57, Annex Bf 42B) to support the view that the processing of data for the purposes of personalised advertising, which does not require cookies, of user and network security and of product improvement, can certainly be regarded as being in the legitimate interests of the undertaking; the case-law also appears to suggest that the processing of data to personalise content and, in some cases, also to ensure the consistent and seamless use of Facebook companies’ products can be regarded as necessary for the performance of Facebook Ireland’s contracts.</p><p>Accordingly, Facebook Ireland could have a legitimate interest, for example, in processing WhatsApp data for user and network security because, as it states in the section of the Data Policy headed ‘How do the Facebook Companies work together?’ (Annex Bf 10), it uses information from WhatsApp accounts sending spam to take action against those accounts on Facebook.com, although this is otherwise neither necessary for the performance of the contract nor likely to be justified by other legitimate interests, since Facebook Ireland does not use WhatsApp data for product and personalisation purposes on Facebook.com (paragraph 746 of the Office’s decision).</p><p>The processing of Instagram data for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products (so that users can be shown people or content on Facebook.com that might also be of interest to them there) could be necessary for the performance of the contract or at least be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. Facebook Ireland could also have a legitimate interest in processing these data for the purposes of personalised advertising, network security and product improvement. In particular, by its own account, Facebook Ireland uses Instagram data from accounts that behave inappropriately or are clearly involved in unlawful activity to ensure the security of Facebook users [Or. 21] (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal). In principle, the same could apply to the processing of Oculus data, although there are not yet enough findings on the specific purposes for which those data are used on Facebook.com.</p><p>The processing of data from Facebook Business Tools, particularly the social plugins Like and Share, and from Facebook Login and Account Kit could be necessary for the performance of the contract, or at least in Facebook Ireland’s legitimate interests, provided it is intended for the personalisation of content and the seamless use of Facebook products. This should require the user to click or tap on the relevant button and should be limited to the data processing operations required in a particular case. Irrespective of whether or not the user has clicked or tapped on the buttons, the collection of data and the linking of those data with the Facebook.com account could be in the legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland if the user has consented to the use of the data for the display of personalised advertisements. Data processing for the purposes of network security or product improvement could also be legitimate interests of Facebook Ireland. By its own account, Facebook uses data from social plugins to identify rapidly, from the many website visits, attempts by bots to open and operate Facebook accounts (paragraph 465 of the statement of grounds of appeal).</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-smart-connections data-lang=smart-connections>Why is processing of personal data by Facebook necessary for performance of the contract?
