<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0014>14</a> ) A company such as Genentech therefore had an interest in concluding such an agreement.</p><ol start=19><li></li></ol><p>Consequently, the sole arbitrator held that any payments made under the licence agreement could not be reclaimed and any payments due thereunder remained due where the patent had been revoked or was not infringed by the licensee’s activity. (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0020>20</a> ) The question referred for a preliminary ruling is therefore devoid of purpose and should be declared inadmissible.</p><ol start=35><li></li></ol><p>In my opinion, the fact that the national court refers, in the question raised, to the revocation of ‘patents’ (in the plural) even though only one patent was revoked does not mean that the request for a preliminary ruling is based on an incorrect factual premiss.</p><ol start=36><li></li></ol><p>It is clearly apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is well aware of the fact that patents US 522 and US 140 have not been not revoked.</p><ol start=37><li></li></ol><p>In that regard, the national court states in page 2 of its request for a preliminary ruling that the technology covered by the licence agreement ‘gave rise to the issue of several patents: European Patent [EP 177] of 22 April 1992, subsequently revoked on 12 January 1999 by the European Patent Office for lack of novelty, American Patent [US 520] of 15 December 1998 and American Patent [US 140] of 17 April 2001’. (

The purpose of the agreement, interpreted in the light of German law and the history of negotiations between the parties, was to protect the user of the patent(s) — namely Genentech — against litigation concerning the patent(s) which could be protracted and costly.

In the performance of this task, arbitrators may naturally find it necessary to apply EU law, if it forms part of the law applicable to the contract (lex contractus) or the law applicable to the arbitration (lex arbitri). However, the responsibility for reviewing compliance with European public policy rules lies with the courts of the Member States and not with arbitrators, whether in the context of an action for annulment or proceedings for recognition and enforcement. (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0040>40</a> ) which entrusts responsibility for ensuring compliance with EU law, applicable to the substance of the dispute, including European public policy rules, to the court hearing the substance of the dispute (the upstream court), and not the downstream court of recognition and enforcement. (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0042>42</a> ) which would, in many cases, make it impossible (or excessively difficult) for individuals to exercise the rights conferred on them by EU competition law.</p><ol start=65><li></li></ol><p>As Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis conceded in paragraph 21 of their written observations, along with their legal expert in paragraph 5 of her opinion, ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0043>43</a> ) the effect of this extremely limited review would be that it would cover only ‘the most obvious infringements [of Article 101 TFEU], such as price-fixing or market-sharing agreements’. Restrictions by effect would therefore completely evade review by the courts hearing actions for annulment, since a finding that such restrictions exist would require more than a token examination of the substance of the arbitral award, which the French courts are unable to do.</p><ol start=66><li></li></ol><p>Even if there were a scale of infringements of Article 101 TFEU based on their obviousness and harmfulness including, in particular, restrictions by object and by effect, ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0044>44</a> ) there is nothing in Article 101 TFEU to support the conclusion that these restrictions would be permissible. Indeed, Article 101 TFEU expressly prohibits agreements between undertakings ‘which have as their object or effect’ ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0045>45</a> ) the restriction of competition. Accordingly, either there is an infringement of Article 101 TFEU, in which case the agreement between undertakings at issue is automatically void, or there is no infringement at all.</p><ol start=67><li></li></ol><p>Consequently, it makes no difference whether the infringement of the public policy rule was flagrant or not. No system can accept infringements of its most fundamental rules making up its public policy, irrespective of whether or not those infringements are flagrant or obvious.</p><p>b) The impossibility of reviewing an international arbitral award on the ground of infringement of public policy where the question was raised and debated before the arbitral tribunal, because this would entail a review of the award as to its substance</p><ol start=68><li></li></ol><p>In paragraph 36 of its judgment in Eco Swiss (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0052>52</a> ) According to Genentech, during the relevant period (1998 to 2008), it manufactured ‘rituximab’ with a view to it being marketed in different Member States, mainly the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It notes that the royalties awarded by the sole arbitrator were calculated on the basis of net worldwide sales of finished products for the period between 1998 and 2008 and that, in view of the high volume of sales in the European Union during the relevant period, the restriction on competition resulting from the payment ordered by the sole arbitrator directly affects trade between Member States.</p><ol start=79><li></li></ol><p>Genentech also explains that it is at a competitive disadvantage on the market, since it is required to pay for the use of a technology which its competitors can take advantage of freely and without charge.</p><ol start=80><li></li></ol><p>Furthermore, Genentech submits that Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis were rewarded and unjustly enriched by receiving ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0053>53</a> ) running royalties in respect of scientific and technological discoveries to which they contributed nothing. It claims that the international arbitration awards at issue in the main proceedings enabled Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis to ‘tax’ their competitors and impose a financial burden on the pharmaceutical industry in general and on Genentech and its subsidiaries in particular, which pursue their business both in Europe and in the rest of the world, in contravention of EU competition law.</p><ol start=81><li></li></ol><p>As regards competition in the strict sense, Genentech claims that Sanofi-Aventis is the second largest pharmaceutical group in Europe in terms of revenue for prescription medicines and is involved in research and development as well as the manufacture of medicinal products in several therapeutic areas. It also states that Sanofi-Aventis is one of the main competitors of Roche (which currently wholly owns Genentech) in the research-based field of the pharmaceutical industry.</p><ol start=82><li></li></ol><p>By contrast, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis argue that the arbitral awards disputed by Genentech have only a very weak link to the European Union.</p><ol start=83><li></li></ol><p>They also submit that the royalties owed by Genentech do not derive from any European patent and that the international arbitral awards in dispute do not have even the slightest impact on Genentech’s sales. Furthermore, they claim that the sole arbitrator ruled on the single question whether Genentech was contractually bound to pay the royalties provided for in the licence agreement and that the royalties awarded to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis in the final award were calculated on the basis of worldwide sales of Rituxan®, only 17% of which related to the European Union, corresponding to approximately EUR 18 million during the period at issue between 1998 and 2008.</p><p>c) Assessment</p><ol start=84><li></li></ol><p>Concerning the assessment of the effect on trade between Member States, I concur with the Commission’s observations in its replies to the written questions put by the Court that it is for the national court to determine whether, in the light of the characteristics of the market at issue, it is sufficiently likely that the obligation to pay royalties, in compliance with the final award and under the licence agreement, exerts a direct or indirect, actual or potential influence on the movement of trade between the Member States, and that this influence is not insignificant. (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055>55</a> ) The aim of Article 101 TFEU is not to regulate commercial relations between undertakings in a general way, but rather to prohibit some types of agreements between them which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market.</p><ol start=86><li></li></ol><p>In addition, in its judgment in Ottung (

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0058>58</a> ) I consider that the case-law can be applied to the present case by analogy.</p><ol start=90><li></li></ol><p>The third partial award confirms the fact that Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties flowed not from the use of a technology protected by valid patents, but from the licence agreement alone. ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059>59</a> ) The sole arbitrator’s interpretation of the licence agreement under German law clearly shows that the commercial purpose of the agreement was to enable Genentech to use the enhancer at issue while averting patent litigation. Since Genentech, unlike other users of the enhancer who did not conclude a licence agreement with Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, actually benefited from this ‘temporary truce’ ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0060>60</a> ) for the duration of the licence agreement, the payments for using the enhancer, owed by Genentech under the agreement, were not reimbursable notwithstanding the absence of infringement or the revocation of the patents at issue.</p><ol start=91><li></li></ol><p>Furthermore, the obligation to pay royalties was stipulated to last only for the duration of the validity of the licence agreement and Genentech was freely able to terminate it by giving very short notice of two months. ( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#t-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0061>61</a> ) As soon as the licence agreement was terminated, Genentech was therefore in exactly the same position as all other users of the enhancer at issue. (

He found that the commercial reason that led the parties to enter into the licence agreement was that, when the agreement was concluded, Behringwerke had a patented invention (namely patent EP 177) which Genentech wished to make commercial use of without running the risk of infringing the patent (see, to that effect, paragraph 258 of the third partial award). According to the sole arbitrator, the question of the validity of the patent was not relevant under German law, which recognises the contractual right to royalty payments in a licence agreement even if the patent at issue is ultimately revoked. He held that, pursuant to German law, a person could also grant a licence in respect of an invention that was not patented or not patentable (see, to that effect, paragraph 292 of the third partial award).</p><p>(

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0033>33</a> ) Since the action for annulment concerns, in accordance with Article 1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure, international arbitral awards delivered in France, the subject matter of the review is the international arbitral award itself and not the underlying instrument containing the arbitration clause which gave rise to the arbitration, in this case the licence agreement. It is true that international arbitral awards are not agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article 101 TFEU, but international legal decisions which are not attached to any State legal order and instead fall within the scope of the international arbitral order (see judgment of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 8 July 2015 in Ryanair, No 13-25.846, FR:CCASS:2015:C100797; also see, to that effect, judgments of Civil Chamber One of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) of 23 March 1994 in Hilmarton Ltd, No 92-15137, Bull. civ. I, No 104, p. 79, and 29 June 2007 in PT Putrabali Adyamulia, No 05-18053, Bull. civ. I, No 250). However, the judgment in Eco Swiss (

Otherwise, the parties could put anticompetitive agreements beyond the reach of Article 101 TFEU by inserting arbitration clauses in those agreements.</p><p>(

I use this term to avoid confusion with some arbitral tribunals which the Court has found fulfil the criteria laid down in the case-law in order to be able to refer a question for a preliminary ruling (see judgment in Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta, Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta,

Based on this case-law, the arbitral tribunals hearing cases within the framework of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) could be regarded as being able to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling. See, to that effect, Basedow, J., ‘EU Law in International Arbitration: Referrals to the European Court of Justice’, Journal of International Arbitration, Vol. 32, 2015, p. 367, p. 376 to 381. Since the number and size of investment arbitrations raising questions on the application of EU law are increasing, particularly in the field of State aid, the possibility for arbitral tribunals to refer questions for a preliminary ruling could help to ensure the correct and effective implementation of EU law.</p><p>(

However, in so far as these legal rules, such as the ICSID convention, are binding on Member States vis-à-vis third countries, they fall within the ambit of Article 351 TFEU. A conflict between the international arbitral order and the EU legal order could be averted if arbitral tribunals were able to submit questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling (see footnote 34).</p><p>(

If that were the case, EU law in its entirety, from the Charter of Fundamental Rights to a directive on pressurised equipment, would be a matter of public policy …’. In point 177 of that Opinion, I explained, by citing paragraph 304 of the judgment in Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission (
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A461&locale=en" rel=noopener>C‑402/05 P and C‑415/05 P</a>,

These are therefore ‘mandatory rule[s] which [are] so fundamental to the [EU] legal order that [they] cannot be subject to any derogation whatsoever in the context of the case at issue’ (see point 100 of my Opinion in Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, 
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A11&locale=en" rel=noopener>C‑438/14</a>,

Articles 101 TFEU and 102 TFEU are, in that sense, fundamental provisions which are essential for the functioning of the internal market, without which the European Union would not function and the breach of which, whether or not flagrant or obvious, would be unacceptable from the standpoint of the EU legal order.</p><p>(

In the present case, the sole arbitrator is not a ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ within the meaning of this case-law because his jurisdiction is not binding and is instead the result of a contractual choice freely made by the parties to the licence agreement which gave rise to the arbitral awards at issue in the main proceedings.</p><p>( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0049>49</a> ) In their replies to the written questions put by the Court, Genentech, Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the French Government and the Commission submit that the third partial award does not concern patent EP 177. The Commission argues that the two US patents (patents US 522 and US 140) are not much more relevant to the third partial award. It contends that, under the law applicable to the licence agreement, namely German law, the revocation or annulment of a patent under licence does not affect the obligation to pay royalties, adding that a licence may be granted under German law even for a technology which is not patented or not patentable. Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis state that it is clearly apparent from the third partial award that the sole arbitrator ordered Genentech to pay the royalties owed to Sanofi based exclusively on the fact that Genentech used the enhancer forming the subject matter of the licence agreement to manufacture Rituxan® in the United States.</p><p>( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0050>50</a> ) It is not disputed that, according to the US courts, patents US 522 and US 140 are not infringed. The sole arbitrator also found in paragraphs 322 to 330 of the third partial award that the enhancer had been used to manufacture Rituxan® between 15 December 1998 and 27 October 2008. See point 16 of this Opinion.</p><p>(

The orders and rulings have therefore been enforced.</p><p>( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0054>54</a> ) According to the Commission, there are factors which suggest that the obligation to pay the royalties at issue may have such an influence. ‘First, the geographic scope of the licence agreement is worldwide and thus includes the whole of the European Union … Secondly, the licence agreement relates to a technology which, in the [sole] arbitrator’s opinion, was used to manufacture rituximab, the active ingredient of the medicinal product MabThera® marketed in the European Union. Thirdly, MabThera® was the subject of marketing authorisation … under Article 3 of [Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93]. Fourthly, it appears that Genentech marketed MabThera® in at least Germany, France and Italy. Fifthly, it appears that Sanofi and [Genentech, now part of the Roche group,] are major competitors in the field of pharmaceutical research and, in particular, are potential competitors within the sphere of action of Rituxan® (and MabThera®). Sixthly, the obligation to pay royalties may add to Genentech’s manufacturing costs and have the effect of reducing competition on existing product and technology markets, particularly within the sphere of action of MabThera®. Seventhly, it appears that Rituxan® and MabThera® generate turnover in excess of one billion euros, enabling them to be regarded as “blockbuster” medicinal products.’</p><p>( 
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0055>55</a> ) As Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis observed in their replies to the written questions put by the Court, ‘the mere fact that the payment of contractual royalties owed under the licence agreement may possibly constitute a financial burden for the licensee, in this case Genentech, is not sufficient to characterise a restriction on competition. Such a burden simply illustrates the commercial nature of the licence agreement, which was concluded with complete knowledge of the facts by fully informed commercial undertakings of equal strength, and which — as with all other commercial agreements — may turn out to be commercially less advantageous than initially envisaged by one of the parties’.</p><p>(

Genentech considers that the Commission, in its decision of 2 December 1975 relating to a proceeding under Article [101 TFEU] (IV/26.949 — AOIP v Beyrard) (
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1976:006:TOC" rel=noopener>OJ 1976 L 6, p. 8</a>), ‘stated that there is a restriction on competition where a clause of a licensed patent agreement “provides for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor’s patents are exploited”. According to the Commission …, a clause such as this in a licence agreement “is also incompatible with Article
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=1>101</a>, in the same way as the obligation to pay royalties after the expiration of a patent”’ (my emphasis). Genentech’s observations concern a clause which requires a licensee to pay royalties where it manufactures the products referred to in the agreement without using the licensor’s patents. In that decision, the Commission found that the clause had a restrictive effect on competition because it provided for the payment of royalties to the licensor whether or not the licensor’s patents were exploited. It considered that the clause at issue, like other clauses laying down an obligation to pay royalties after the expiry of a patent, was incompatible with Article 101(1) TFEU. It should be noted that the Commission, like the Court in paragraph 13 of its judgment in Ottung (
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1989%3A195&locale=en" rel=noopener>320/87</a>,

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#c-ECR_62014CC0567_EN_01-E0059>59</a> ) According to Hoechst and Sanofi-Aventis, the national laws of several Member States provide that, where a patent is revoked, the licensee is entitled to stop paying royalties in the future, but cannot demand reimbursement of royalties already paid.</p><p>(
