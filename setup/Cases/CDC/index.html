The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.</p><p>(12)</p><p>In addition to the defendantâ€™s domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>(14)</p><p>The autonomy of the parties to a contract, other than an insurance, consumer or employment contract, where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed, must be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this Regulation.</p><p>(15)</p><p>In the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in two Member States. &mldr;â€™</p><p>4</p><p>ArticlesÂ 2 toÂ 31 of that regulation, which appear under Chapter II thereof, contain rules on jurisdiction.</p><p>5</p><p>SectionÂ 1 of that chapter, entitled â€˜General Provisionsâ€™, contains ArticleÂ 2(1), which is worded as follows:</p><p>â€˜Subject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State.â€™</p><p>6</p><p>ArticleÂ 5(3) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 provides that a person domiciled in a Member State may be sued in another Member State â€˜in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occurâ€™.</p><p>7</p><p>ArticleÂ 6(1) of that regulation states:</p><p>â€˜A person domiciled in a Member State may also be sued:</p><p>(1)</p><p>where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.â€™</p><p>8</p><p>ArticleÂ 23(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001, which appears in SectionÂ 7 of Chapter II, entitled â€˜Prorogation of jurisdictionâ€™, provides:</p><p>â€˜If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a Member State, have agreed that a court or the courts of a Member State are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction.

By application of 16Â March 2009, it brought an action for damages before the referring court against six chemical undertakings which, with the exception of the intervening party and former defendant, Evonik Degussa GmbH (â€˜Evonik Degussaâ€™), which has its seat in Essen (Germany), were domiciled in five Member States other than the Federal Republic of Germany.</p><p>10</p><p>In support of its action, in which CDC seeks to have the defendants in the main proceedings ordered to pay damages jointly and severally and to provide disclosure, that undertaking relies on Commission Decision 2006/903/EC of 3Â May 2006 relating to a proceeding under ArticleÂ 81 [EC] and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement against Akzo Nobel NV, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB, EKA Chemicals AB, Degussa AG, Edison SpA, FMC Corporation, FMC Foret S.A., Kemira OYJ, Lâ€™Air Liquide SA, Chemoxal SA, Snia SpA, Caffaro Srl, Solvay SA/NV, Solvay Solexis SpA, Total SA, Elf Aquitaine SA and Arkema SA (Case COMP/F/C.38.620Â â€” Hydrogen Peroxide andÂ perborate) (

According to that decision, the infringement started on 31Â January 1994 at the latest and lasted at least until 31Â December 2000. It consisted principally in exchanging important and confidential market and/or company-relevant information, limiting and/or controlling production, allocating markets and customers and fixing and monitoring prices as part of multilateral and/or bilateral meetings and telephone conversations held at regular and irregular intervals mainly in Belgium, Germany and France.</p><p>11</p><p>In that regard, CDC invokes agreements concerning the transfer of claims for damages entered into with 32 undertakings domiciled in 13 different Member States of the European Union or of the European Economic Area (â€˜the EEAâ€™), some of which undertakings had previously concluded similar transfer agreements with 39 other undertakings. The undertakings at issue operate in the industrial pulp and paper processing industry. The applicant submits that, from 1994 toÂ 2006, those undertakings purchased substantial quantities of hydrogen peroxide in various EU and EEA Member States, some undertakings having supplied hydrogen peroxide to plants in several EU Member States. According to the defendants in the main proceedings, some of the contracts of sale included agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction.</p><p>12</p><p>In September 2009, CDC withdrew its action against Evonik Degussa following a settlement with that undertaking. In late 2009, the remaining defendants in the main proceedings joined the former defendant and the firms Chemoxal SA and Edison S.p.A. to the proceedings. Relying on various agreements on arbitration and jurisdiction provided for in some of the sales contracts by which they were bound to the undertakings allegedly victims of the defendantsâ€™ cartel agreements, the defendants in the main proceedings contended that the referring court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.</p><p>13</p><p>In that context, the referring court considers that it could have international jurisdiction only by virtue of ArticlesÂ 5(3) andÂ 6(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001. If the conditions for such jurisdiction were satisfied, CDC would be free to sue the defendants in the main proceedings before one of the courts deemed to have jurisdiction in accordance with those provisions, provided that the jurisdiction of those courts is not validly excluded in accordance with ArticleÂ 23 of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 or by an arbitration agreement.</p><p>14</p><p>In those circumstances the Landgericht Dortmund decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:</p><p>â€˜1.</p><p>Is ArticleÂ 6(1) of [Regulation NoÂ 44/2001] to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action in which a defendant domiciled in the same State as the court and other defendants domiciled in other Member States â€¦ are together the subject of an application for disclosure and damages on account of a single and continuous infringement of ArticleÂ 81 EC/ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the â€¦ Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, it is expedient to hear and determine those applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings?</p><p>Is it significant in this regard if the action against the defendant domiciled in the same State as the court is withdrawn after having been served on all the defendants, before the expiry of the periods prescribed by the court for lodging a defence and before the start of the first hearing?</p><ol start=2><li></li></ol><p>Is ArticleÂ 5(3) of Regulation â€¦ NoÂ 44/2001 to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for disclosure and damages brought against defendants domiciled in a number of Member States â€¦ on account of a single and continuous infringement of ArticleÂ 81 EC/ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement which has been established by the European Commission and committed in several Member States and in which the defendants have participated in different places and at different times, the harmful event occurred in relation to each defendant and in relation to all heads of damage claimed or the overall loss in those Member States in which cartel agreements were concluded and implemented?</p><ol start=3><li></li></ol><p>In the case of actions for damages for infringement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices contained in ArticleÂ 81 EC/ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement, does the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in [EU] law allow account to be taken of arbitration and jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods, where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under ArticleÂ 5(3) and/or ArticleÂ 6(1) of Regulation â€¦ NoÂ 44/2001 in relation to all the defendants and/or all or some of the claims brought?â€™</p><p>Consideration of the questions referred</p><p>The first question</p><p>15</p><p>By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether ArticleÂ 6(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that it may, under that provision, be expedient to hear and determine applications together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings in the case of an action for damages, and for disclosure in that regard, brought jointly against undertakings which have participated in different places and at different times in a single and continuous infringement, as found by a decision of the Commission, of the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices provided for in EU law, even where the applicant has withdrawn its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same State as the court seised.</p><p>16</p><p>In order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind from the outset that ArticleÂ 6(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 must be interpreted independently, by reference to its scheme and purpose (see judgment in Reisch Montage,Â

Despite the fact that the defendants in the main proceedings participated in the implementation of the cartel at issue by concluding and performing contracts under it, in different places and at different times, according to Decision 2006/903 upon which the claims in the main proceedings are based, the cartel agreement amounted to a single and continuous infringement of ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement.

In those circumstances, the participants could have expected to be sued in the courts of a Member State in which one of them is domiciled.</p><p>25</p><p>It must therefore be considered that determining separately actions for damages against several undertakings domiciled in different Member States which, contrary to EU competition law, participated in a single and continuous cartel may lead to irreconcilable judgments within the meaning of ArticleÂ 6(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001.</p><p>26</p><p>That said, it remains to be considered to what extent the applicantâ€™s withdrawal of its action against the sole co-defendant domiciled in the same Member State as the court seised is capable of rendering the rule of jurisdiction provided for in ArticleÂ 6(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 inapplicable.</p><p>27</p><p>According to settled case-law, that rule cannot be interpreted as allowing an applicant to make a claim against a number of defendants for the sole purpose of removing one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State in which that defendant is domiciled (judgments in Reisch Montage,Â

However, the event giving rise to the alleged loss did not consist in a potential breach of contractual obligations, but in a restriction of the buyerâ€™s freedom of contract as a result of that cartel in the sense that that restriction prevented the buyer from being supplied at a price determined by the rules of supply and demand.</p><p>44</p><p>In those circumstances, the place of a causal event of loss consisting in additional costs that a buyer had to pay because a cartel has distorted market prices can be identified, in the abstract, as the place of the conclusion of the cartel. Once concluded, the participants in a cartel ensure through action or forbearance that there is no competition and that prices are distorted. Where the place of a cartelâ€™s conclusion is known, it would be consistent with the aims outlined in paragraphÂ 39 above for the courts of that place to have jurisdiction.</p><p>45</p><p>That conclusion is, however, not relevant in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, according to the findings of the Commission as set out in the order for reference, it is not possible to identify a single place where the cartel at issue was concluded since the cartel consisted of a number of collusive agreements concluded during various meetings and discussions which took place in various places in the European Union.</p><p>46</p><p>The above considerations are without prejudice to a situation in which, among several agreements that, as a whole, amounted to the unlawful cartel at issue, there was one in particular which was the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer. In that case, the courts in whose jurisdiction that particular agreement was concluded would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the loss thereby inflicted upon that buyer.</p><p>47</p><p>In the latter case, as well as in that in which the referring court were to find that the cartel at issue in the main proceedings was nevertheless definitively concluded in its jurisdiction, the issue still needs to be addressed as to whether several participants in that cartel can be sued before the same court.</p><p>48</p><p>The Court has indeed held on another set of facts that ArticleÂ 5(3) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 does not allow the courts of the place where a harmful event occurred which is imputed to one of the presumed perpetrators of damage, who is not a party to the dispute, to take jurisdiction in an action against another presumed perpetrator of that damage who has not acted within the jurisdiction of that court (judgment in Melzer,Â

As for loss consisting in additional costs incurred because of artificially high prices, such as the price of the hydrogen peroxide supplied by the cartel at issue in the main proceedings, that place is identifiable only for each alleged victim taken individually and is located, in general, at that victimâ€™s registered office.</p><p>53</p><p>That place fully guarantees the efficacious conduct of potential proceedings, given that the assessment of a claim for damages for loss allegedly inflicted upon a specific undertaking as a result of an unlawful cartel, as already found by the Commission in a binding decision, essentially depends on factors specifically relating to the situation of that undertaking. In those circumstances, the courts in whose jurisdiction that undertaking has its registered office are manifestly best suited to adjudicate such a claim.</p><p>54</p><p>Those courts, as identified, have jurisdiction to hear an action brought either against any one of the participants in the cartel or against several of them for the whole of the loss inflicted upon that undertaking as a result of additional costs that it had to pay to be supplied with products covered by the cartel concerned.</p><p>55</p><p>However, given that the jurisdiction of the court seised of the matter by virtue of the place where the loss occurred is limited to the loss suffered by the undertaking whose registered office is located in its jurisdiction, an applicant such as CDC, who has consolidated several undertakingsâ€™ potential claims for damages, would therefore, in accordance with the case-law set out in paragraphÂ 35 above, need to bring separate actions for the loss suffered by each of those undertakings before the courts with jurisdiction for their respective registered offices.</p><p>56</p><p>In the light of the above, the answer to the second question is that ArticleÂ 5(3) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of an action for damages brought against defendants domiciled in various Member States as a result of a single and continuous infringement of ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement, which has been established by the Commission, in which the defendants participated in several Member States, at different times and in different places, the harmful event occurred in relation to each alleged victim on an individual basis and each of the victims can, by virtue of ArticleÂ 5(3), choose to bring an action before the courts of the place in which the cartel was definitively concluded or, as the case may be, the place in which one agreement in particular was concluded which is identifiable as the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly suffered, or before the courts of the place where its own registered office is located.</p><p>The third question</p><p>57</p><p>By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether ArticleÂ 23(1) of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001 and the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements in EU law must, in the case of actions for damages for an infringement of ArticleÂ 101 TFEU and ArticleÂ 53 of the EEA Agreement, be interpreted as allowing account to be taken of jurisdiction clauses contained in contracts for the supply of goods where this has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of a court with international jurisdiction under ArticleÂ 5(3) and/or ArticleÂ 6(1) of that regulation.</p><p>58</p><p>Before assessing that question, it must be made clear that, with regard to certain terms derogating from otherwise applicable rules allegedly contained in the contracts at issue but which do not fall within the scope of application of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001, the Court does not have sufficient information at its disposal in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court.</p><p>59</p><p>With regard to the terms at issue in the third question which fall within the scope of that regulation, it is to be observed that, in the context of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed in Brussels on 27Â September 1968 (
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1972:299:TOC" rel=noopener>OJ 1972, LÂ 299, p.Â 32</a>), the Court has stated that, by concluding an agreement on the choice of court under ArticleÂ 17 of the Brussels Convention, the parties may derogate, not only from the general jurisdiction under ArticleÂ 2 thereof, but also from the special jurisdiction laid down in ArticlesÂ 5 andÂ 6 of that convention (see judgment in Estasis Saloti di Colzani,Â

First, the Court has already held that the substantive rules applicable to the substance of a case must not affect the validity of a jurisdiction clause agreed in accordance with ArticleÂ 17 of the Brussels Convention (see, to that effect, judgment in Castelletti,Â

In accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphÂ 60 above, that interpretation is also relevant to ArticleÂ 23 of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001.</p><p>63</p><p>Second, it must be considered that the court seised of the matter cannot, without undermining the aim of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001, refuse to take into account a jurisdiction clause which has satisfied the requirements of ArticleÂ 23 of that regulation solely on the ground that it considers that the court with jurisdiction under that clause would not give full effect to the requirement of effective enforcement of the prohibition of cartel agreements by not allowing a victim of the cartel to obtain full compensation for the loss it suffered. On the contrary, it must be considered that the system of legal remedies in each Member State, together with the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in ArticleÂ 267 TFEU, affords a sufficient guarantee to individuals in that respect (see, by analogy, judgment in Renault,Â

In a case such as that in the main proceedings, the court before which the action is brought must, nevertheless, ensure that the clauses at issue actually bind the applicant in the main proceedings before examining the requirements of form laid down in ArticleÂ 23 of Regulation NoÂ 44/2001. As the Court has already made clear, a jurisdiction clause incorporated in a contract may, in principle, produce effects only in the relations between the parties who have given their agreement to the conclusion of that contract. In order for a third party to rely on such a clause it is, in principle, necessary that the third party has given his consent to that effect (judgment in Refcomp,Â

The purpose of that requirement is to avoid a party being taken by surprise by the assignment of jurisdiction to a given forum as regards all disputes which may arise out of its relationship with the other party to the contract and stem from a relationship other than that in connection with which the agreement conferring jurisdiction was made (see, to that effect, judgment in Powell Duffryn,Â
