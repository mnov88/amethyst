In the present reference for a preliminary ruling, the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 4 de Bilbao (Court of First Instance No 4, Bilbao) (‘the referring court’) has asked the Court of Justice a question on the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. (2)
Specifically, the question is whether, in order for the purpose of the directive, which is to protect consumers, to be attained, the national court hearing an action for enforcement must determine of its own motion whether an arbitration agreement is void and accordingly annul the award if it finds that that arbitration agreement contains an unfair term to the detriment of the consumer.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mnov88.github.io/amethyst/setup/Cases/Asturcom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mnov88.github.io/amethyst/setup/Cases/Asturcom/</guid><description>Case C-40/08
